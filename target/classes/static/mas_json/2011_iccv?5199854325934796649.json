It is defined as the Menger-Melnikov curvature of the Radon measure |Du|, which can be understood as a measure theoretic formulation of curvature mathematically related to mean curvature. The functional is not convex, therefore we define a convex relaxation which yields a close approximation. Similar to the total variation, the relaxation can be written as the support functional of a convex set, which means that there are stable and efficient minimization algorithms available when it is used as a regularizer in image processing problems. Our current implementation can handle general inverse problems, inpainting and segmentation. We demonstrate in experiments and comparisons how the regularizer performs in practice.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Bastian Goldl\u00fccke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldl=uuml=cke:Bastian", "Daniel Cremers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cremers:Daniel"], "pages": 8}
