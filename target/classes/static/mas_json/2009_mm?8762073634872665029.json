While most systems represent videos with keyframes and then apply techniques well-known for static images, we investigate motion as another discriminative clue for pornography detection. A framework is presented that combines conventional keyframe-based methods with a statistical analysis of MPEG-4 motion vectors. Two general approaches are followed to describe motion patterns, one based on the detection of periodic motion and one on motion histograms. Our experiments on real-world web video data show that this combination with motion information improves the accuracy of pornography detection significantly (equal error is reduced from 9.9% to 6.0%). Comparing both motion descriptors, histograms outperform periodicity detection.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology"], "authors": ["Christian Jansohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jansohn:Christian", "Adrian Ulges.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ulges:Adrian", "Thomas M.
