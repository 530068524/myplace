Unlike previous work, our algorithm is based on a conceptually simple and straightforward probabilistic formulation of partial shape matching: based on a Markov random field model, we obtain a probability distribution over all possible intrinsic matches of a shape to itself, which reveals the symmetry structure of the object. Rather than examining this exponentially sized distribution directly, which is infeasible, we approximate marginals of this distribution using sum-product loopy belief propagation and show how the symmetry information can subsequently be extracted from this condensed representation. Using a parallel implementation on graphics hardware, we are able to extract symmetries of deformable shapes in general poses efficiently. We apply our algorithm on several standard 3D models, demonstrating that a concise probabilistic model yields a practical and general symmetry detection algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Saarland University", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ruxandra Lasowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lasowski:Ruxandra", "Art Tevs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tevs:Art", "Hans-Peter Seidel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidel:Hans=Peter", "Michael Wand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wand:Michael"], "pages": 8}
