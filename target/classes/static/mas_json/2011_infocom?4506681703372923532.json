We consider a system consisting of two parallel queues, served by a single server. One of the queues receives heavy-tailed traffic, and the other receives light-tailed traffic. We study the class of throughput-optimal max-weight-  $\\alpha $    scheduling policies and derive an exact asymptotic characterization of the steady-state queue-length distributions. In particular, we show that the tail of the light queue distribution is at least as heavy as a power-law curve, whose tail coefficient we obtain explicitly. Our asymptotic characterization also shows that the celebrated max-weight scheduling policy leads to the worst possible tail coefficient of the light queue distribution, among all nonidling policies. Motivated by the above negative result regarding the max-weight-  $\\alpha $   policy, we analyze a log-max-weight (LMW) scheduling policy. We show that the LMW policy guarantees an exponentially decaying light queue tail while still being throughput-optimal.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Madras", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Krishna P.
