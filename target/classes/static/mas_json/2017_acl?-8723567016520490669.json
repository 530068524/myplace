Yet it remains an elusive, poorly measured construct. Recent research draws on computational linguistics to measure cultural fit but overlooks asymmetries in cultural adaptation. By contrast, we develop a directed, dynamic measure of cultural fit based on linguistic alignment, which estimates the influence of one person\u2019s word use on another\u2019s and distinguishes between two enculturation mechanisms: internalization and selfregulation. We use this measure to trace employees\u2019 enculturation trajectories over a large, multi-year corpus of corporate emails and find that patterns of alignment in the first six months of employment are predictive of individuals downstream outcomes, especially involuntary exit. Further predictive analyses suggest referential alignment plays an overlooked role in linguistic alignment.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Stanford University", "University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Gabriel Doyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doyle:Gabriel", "Amir Goldberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldberg:Amir", "Sameer Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Sameer", "Michael C.
