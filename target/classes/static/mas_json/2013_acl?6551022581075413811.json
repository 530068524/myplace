{"title": "Graph Propagation for Paraphrasing Out-of-Vocabulary Words in Statistical Machine Translation.", "fields": ["phrase", "training set", "lexicon", "test data", "machine translation"], "abstract": "Out-of-vocabulary (oov) words or phrases still remain a challenge in statistical machine translation especially when a limited amount of parallel text is available for training or when there is a domain shift from training data to test data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to finding translations for oov words. We induce a lexicon by constructing a graph on source language monolingual text and employ a graph propagation technique in order to find translations for all the source language phrases. Our method differs from previous approaches by adopting a graph propagation approach that takes into account not only one-step (from oov directly to a source language phrase that has a translation) but multi-step paraphrases from oov source language words to other source language phrases and eventually to target language translations. Experimental results show that our graph propagation method significantly improves performance over two strong baselines under intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Monash University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Majid Razmara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Razmara:Majid", "Maryam Siahbani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siahbani:Maryam", "Reza Haffari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haffari:Reza", "Anoop Sarkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkar:Anoop"], "pages": 11}
