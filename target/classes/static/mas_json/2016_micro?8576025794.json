Absolute quantification determines the input copy number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment group to that of another sample such as an untreated control. The 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394 C  T   method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394 C  T   method. In addition, we present the derivation and applications of two variations of the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394 C  T   method that may be useful in the analysis of real-time, quantitative PCR data.", "citation": "Citations (88,559)", "departments": ["Applied Biosystems", "Washington State University", "Ohio State University", "Applied Biosystems", "Partners HealthCare", "Brigham and Women's Hospital", "McGill University Health Centre", "University of Ulm", "Virginia Commonwealth University", "University of Miami", "Scripps Health", "Beaumont Hospital", "Georgetown University", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Research Institute", "Gastroenterology", "Minnesota Clini ...
