For multiple inlier structures, with different noise covariances, the estimator iteratively determines one inlier structure at a time. Unlike pbM, where the scale of the inlier noise is estimated simultaneously with the model parameters, gpbM has three distinct stages\u2013scale estimation, robust model estimation and inlier/outlier dichotomy. We evaluate our performance on challenging synthetic data, face image clustering upto ten different faces from Yale Face Database B and multi-body projective motion segmentation problem on Hopkins155 dataset. Results of state-of-the-art methods are presented for comparison.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sushil Mittal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mittal:Sushil", "Saket Anand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anand:Saket", "Peter Meer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meer:Peter"], "pages": 8}
