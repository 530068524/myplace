{"title": "Combining Breadth-First and Depth-First Strategies in Searching for Treewidth.", "fields": ["incremental heuristic search", "beam search", "beam stack search", "best first search", "depth first search"], "abstract": "Breadth-first and depth-first search are basic search strategies upon which many other search algorithms are built. In this paper, we describe an approach to integrating these two strategies in a single algorithm that combines the complementary strengths of both. We show the benefits of this approach using the treewidth problem as an example.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["PARC", "Mississippi State University"], "authors": ["Rong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Rong", "Eric A.
