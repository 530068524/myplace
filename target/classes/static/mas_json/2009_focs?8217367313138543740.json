Here is the list of problems we show to be ${\\bf{PPAD}}$-complete, along with the domains of practical significance: fractional stable paths problem (FSPP)---Internet routing; core of balanced games---economics and game theory; Scarf's lemma---combinatorics; hypergraph matching---social choice and preference systems; fractional bounded budget connection games (FBBC)---social networks; and strong fractional kernel---graph theory. In fact, we show that no fully polynomial-time approximation schemes exist (unless ${\\bf{PPAD}}$ is in ${\\bf{FP}}$). This paper is entirely a series of reductions that build in nontrivial ways on the framework established in previous work. In the course of deriving these reductions, we created two new concepts---preference games and personalized equilibria. The entire set of new reductions can be presented as a lattice with the above problems sandwiched between preference ...", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Shiva Kintali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kintali:Shiva", "Laura J.
