{"title": "Learning via Gaussian Herding.", "fields": ["training set", "herding", "gaussian", "weight", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We introduce a new family of online learning algorithms based upon constraining the velocity flow over a distribution of weight vectors. In particular, we show how to effectively herd a Gaussian weight vector distribution by trading off velocity constraints with a loss function. By uniformly bounding this loss function, we demonstrate how to solve the resulting optimization analytically. We compare the resulting algorithms on a variety of real world datasets, and demonstrate how these algorithms achieve state-of-the-art robust performance, especially with high label noise in the training data.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Koby Crammer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crammer:Koby", "Daniel D.
