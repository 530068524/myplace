The results indicate that the participants strongly preferred the touch-based methods in both pragmatic and hedonic qualities as well as in the overall attractiveness. While the leader-driven method allowed better control over the group and required only one participant to be able to form a group, the peer-based method helped to create a greater sense of community and scaled better for larger group sizes and distances. As the optimal group-binding method depends on the social situation and physical environment, the binding methods should be flexible, allowing the users to adapt them to different contexts of use. For determining the order of the devices, manual arrangement was preferred over defining the order by touching.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Nokia", "Nokia"], "authors": ["Tero Jokela.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jokela:Tero", "Andr\u00e9s Lucero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucero:Andr=eacute=s"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
