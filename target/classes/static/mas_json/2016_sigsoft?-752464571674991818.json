{"title": "Titanium: efficient analysis of evolving alloy specifications.", "fields": ["alloy analyzer", "specification language", "sync", "logic model", "software system"], "abstract": "The Alloy specification language, and the corresponding Alloy Analyzer, have received much attention in the last two decades with applications in many areas of software engineering. Increasingly, formal analyses enabled by Alloy are desired for use in an on-line mode, where the specifications are automatically kept in sync with the running, possibly changing, software system. However, given Alloy Analyzer's reliance on computationally expensive SAT solvers, an important challenge is the time it takes for such analyses to execute at runtime. The fact that in an on-line mode, the analyses are often repeated on slightly revised versions of a given specification, presents us with an opportunity to tackle this challenge. We present Titanium, an extension of Alloy for formal analysis of evolving specifications. By leveraging the results from previous analyses, Titanium narrows the state space of the revised specification, thereby greatly reducing the required computational effort. We describe the semantic basis of Titanium in terms of models specified in relational logic. We show how the approach can be realized atop an existing relational logic model finder. Our experimental results show Titanium achieves a significant speed-up over Alloy Analyzer when applied to the analysis of evolving specifications.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Hamid Bagheri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagheri:Hamid", "Sam Malek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malek:Sam"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
