{"title": "Discriminative spatial saliency for image classification.", "fields": ["margin classifier", "contextual image classification", "linear classifier", "one class classification", "salience"], "abstract": "In many visual classification tasks the spatial distribution of discriminative information is (i) non uniform e.g. person \u2018reading\u2019 can be distinguished from \u2018taking a photo\u2019 based on the area around the arms i.e. ignoring the legs and (ii) has intra class variations e.g. different readers may hold the books differently. Motivated by these observations, we propose to learn the discriminative spatial saliency of images while simultaneously learning a max margin classifier for a given visual classification task. Using the saliency maps to weight the corresponding visual features improves the discriminative power of the image representation. We treat the saliency maps as latent variables and allow them to adapt to the image content to maximize the classification score, while regularizing the change in the saliency maps. Our experimental results on three challenging datasets, for (i) human action classification, (ii) fine grained classification and (iii) scene classification, demonstrate the effectiveness and wide applicability of the method.", "citation": "Citations (212)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Caen Lower Normandy", "University of Caen Lower Normandy", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Gaurav Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma_0004:Gaurav", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jurie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jurie:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Cordelia Schmid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmid:Cordelia"], "pages": 8}
