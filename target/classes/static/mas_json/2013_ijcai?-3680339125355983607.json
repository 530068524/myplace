The latest techniques do not scale-up to domains where multiple defenders must coordinate time-dependent joint activities. To address this challenge, this paper presents two branch-and-price algorithms for solving SSGs, SMARTO and SMARTH, with three novel features: (i) a column-generation approach that uses an ordered network of nodes (determined by solving the traveling salesman problem) to generate individual defender strategies; (ii) exploitation of iterative reward shaping of multiple coordinating defender units to generate coordinated strategies; (iii) generation of tighter upper-bounds for pruning by solving security games that only abide by key scheduling constraints. We provide extensive experimental results and formal analyses.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Eric Anyung Shieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shieh:Eric_Anyung", "Manish Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Manish", "Albert Xin Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Albert_Xin", "Milind Tambe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tambe:Milind"], "pages": 7}
