Chroma Space  demonstrates the effective impacts of using a stylistic approach to address emotional sensations, by making colors move in space. We conducted a study to assess the impact of exposure to achromatic colors to different interactive 3D scenarios. The results suggest that presentation of color has an emotional impact to viewers. We argue that designers of synthetic 3D environments should consider the application of stylistic or thematic use of color on screen to increase the emotional attractiveness of an application.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Wendy Ann Mansilla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mansilla:Wendy_Ann", "Jordi Puig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Puig:Jordi", "Andrew Perkis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perkis:Andrew", "Touradj Ebrahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ebrahimi:Touradj"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
