{"title": "Programming the memory hierarchy revisited: supporting irregular parallelism in sequoia.", "fields": ["instruction level parallelism", "memory hierarchy", "task parallelism", "data parallelism", "implicit parallelism"], "abstract": "We describe two novel constructs for programming parallel machines with multi-level memory hierarchies: call-up, which allows a child task to invoke computation on its parent, and spawn, which spawns a dynamically determined number of parallel children until some termination condition in the parent is met. Together we show that these constructs allow applications with irregular parallelism to be programmed in a straightforward manner, and furthermore these constructs complement and can be combined with constructs for expressing regular parallelism. We have implemented spawn and call-up in Sequoia and we present an experimental evaluation on a number of irregular applications.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Michael Bauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauer:Michael", "John Clark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clark:John", "Eric Schkufza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schkufza:Eric", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex"], "pages": 12}
