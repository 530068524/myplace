Unfortunately, this technique is highly sensitive to initialization and high dimensional data. We present variants of kernelized sorting to increase its robustness and performance on several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks: document matching from parallel and comparable corpora, machine transliteration and even image processing. Empirically we show that, on these tasks, a semi-supervised variant of kernelized sorting outperforms matching canonical correlation analysis.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "authors": ["Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jagarlamudi:Jagadeesh", "Seth Juarez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juarez:Seth", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
