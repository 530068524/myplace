In particular, we prove that these approaches can achieve optimal learning bounds, provided the subsampling level is suitably chosen. These results suggest a simple incremental variant of Nystrom Kernel Regularized Least Squares, where the subsampling level implements a form of computational regularization, in the sense that it controls at the same time regularization and computations. Extensive experimental analysis shows that the considered approach achieves state of the art performances on benchmark large scale datasets.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Genoa", "University of Genoa", "University of Genoa"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alessandro Rudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudi:Alessandro", "Raffaello Camoriano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camoriano:Raffaello", "Lorenzo Rosasco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosasco:Lorenzo"], "pages": 9}
