It allows a piece of unprivileged on-device malware to collaborate with an off-path attacker to infer the TCP sequence numbers used between a client and a server, leading to TCP injection and hijacking attacks. We show that the inference takes, in common cases, under a second to complete and is quick enough for attackers to inject malicious Javascripts into live Facebook sessions and to perform malicious actions on behalf of a victim user. Since supporting unprivileged access to global packet counters is an intentional design choice, we believe our findings provide important lessons and offer insights on future system and network design.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Microsoft"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Zhiyun Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Zhiyun", "Zhuoqing Morley Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Zhuoqing_Morley", "Yinglian Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Yinglian"], "pages": 12}
