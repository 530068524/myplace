Although many supervised tensor learning approaches have been proposed, they either cannot capture the nonlinear relationships of tensor data or cannot preserve the complex multi-way structural information. In this paper, we propose a Multi-way Multi-level Kernel (MMK) model that can extract discriminative, nonlinear and structural preserving representations of tensor data. Specifically, we introduce a kernelized CP tensor factorization technique, which is equivalent to performing the low-rank tensor factorization in a possibly much higher dimensional space that is implicitly defined by the kernel function. We further employ a multi-way nonlinear feature mapping to derive the dual structural preserving kernels, which are used in conjunction with kernel machines (e.g., SVM). Extensive experiments on real-world neuroimages demonstrate that the proposed MMK method can effectively boost the classification performance on diverse brain disorders (i.e., Alzheimers disease, ADHD, and HIV).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "Shenzhen University", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "Shenzhen University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Lifang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Lifang", "Chun-Ta Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Chun=Ta", "Hao Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Hao", "Shen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shen", "Linlin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Linlin", "Philip S.
