We explore the effectiveness of directing a user's attention by imperceptibly modifying existing features of a video. We present three user studies of the effects of applying a saliency modulation technique to video; evaluating modulation awareness, attention, and memory. Our results validate the saliency modulation technique as an alternative means to convey information to the user, suggesting attention shifts and influencing recall of selected regions without perceptible changes to visual input.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Columbia University", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Eduardo E.
