Conventional level set surfaces are only C 0  continuous since the level set evolution involves linear interpolation to compute derivatives. Bajaj et al. present a higher order method to evaluate level set surfaces that are C 2  continuous, but are slow due to high computational burden. In this paper, we provide a higher order GPU based solver for fast and efficient segmentation of large volumetric images. We also extend the higher order method to multi-domain segmentation. Our streaming solver is efficient in memory usage.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Technical University of Denmark", "University of Texas at Austin", "Technical University of Denmark", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ojaswa Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Ojaswa", "Qin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Qin", "Fran\u00e7ois Anton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anton:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Chandrajit L.
