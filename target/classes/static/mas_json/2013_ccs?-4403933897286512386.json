This cost is one of the main obstacles in deploying BFT storage in practice.   In this paper, we present PoWerStore, a robust and efficient data storage protocol. PoWerStore's robustness comprises tolerating network outages, maximum number of Byzantine storage servers, any number of Byzantine readers and crash-faulty writers, and guaranteeing high availability (wait-freedom) and strong consistency (linearizability) of read/write operations. PoWerStore's efficiency stems from combining lightweight cryptography, erasure coding and metadata write-backs, where readers write-back only metadata to achieve strong consistency. Central to PoWerStore is the concept of ``Proofs of Writing'' (PoW), a novel data storage technique inspired by commitment schemes. PoW rely on a 2-round write procedure, in which the first round writes the actual data and the second round only serves to ``prove'' the occurrence of the first round. PoW enable efficient implementations of strongly consistent BFT storage through metadata write-backs and low latency reads.   We implemented PoWerStore and show its improved performance when compared to existing robust storage protocols, including protocols that tolerate only crash faults.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Capgemini", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "NEC Labs Europe ... elberg, Germany", "NEC Labs Europe ... elberg, Germany", "NEC Labs Europe ... elberg, Germany"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Dan Dobre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobre:Dan", "Ghassan Karame.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karame:Ghassan", "Wenting Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenting", "Matthias Majuntke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majuntke:Matthias", "Neeraj Suri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suri:Neeraj", "Marko Vukolic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vukolic:Marko"], "pages": 14}
