{"title": "HICAMP: architectural support for efficient concurrency-safe shared structured data access.", "fields": ["inter process communication", "thread", "memory model", "distributed shared memory", "shared disk architecture"], "abstract": "Programming language and operating system support for efficient concurrency-safe access to shared data is a key concern for the effective use of multi-core processors. Most research has focused on the software model of multiple threads accessing this data within a single shared address space. However, many real applications are actually structured as multiple separate processes for fault isolation and simplified synchronization. In this paper, we describe the HICAMP architecture and its innovative memory system, which supports efficient concurrency safe access to structured shared data without incurring the overhead of inter-process communication. The HICAMP architecture also provides support for programming language and OS structures such as threads, iterators, read-only access and atomic update. In addition to demonstrating that HICAMP is beneficial for multi-process structured applications, our evaluation shows that the same mechanisms provide substantial benefits for other areas, including sparse matrix computations and virtualization.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Hicamp Systems, ... o Park, CA, USA", "Hicamp Systems, ... o Park, CA, USA", "Hicamp Systems, ... o Park, CA, USA"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["David R.
