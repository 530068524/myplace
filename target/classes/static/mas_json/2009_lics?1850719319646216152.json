They can define quantitative languages L that assign to each word w a real number L(w). In the case of infinite words, the value of a run is naturally computed as the maximum, limsup, liminf, limit-average, or discounted-sum of the transition weights. The value of a word w is the supremum of the values of the runs over w. We study expressiveness and closure questions about these quantitative languages.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "authors": ["Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Laurent Doyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doyen_0001:Laurent", "Thomas A.
