Yet the completion of a formal verification effort is rarely a requirement for hardware tapeout. Simulation remains the primary verification methodology, and means of deciding when verification is complete. In this paper we discuss how formal verification can be deployed using simulation-based coverage in a simulation-based verification schedule.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Oski Technology, Inc.", "Oski Technology, Inc."], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Vigyan Singhal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singhal:Vigyan", "Prashant Aggarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aggarwal:Prashant"], "pages": 6}
