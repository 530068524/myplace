At the center of our method is a unified framework for deciding the feasibility of inter-thread interferences to avoid propagating spurious data flows during static analysis and thus boost the performance of the static analyzer. We formulate the checking of interference feasibility as a set of Datalog rules which are both efficiently solvable and general enough to capture a range of hardware-level memory models. Compared to existing techniques, our method can significantly reduce the number of bogus alarms as well as unsound proofs. We implemented the method and evaluated it on a large set of multithreaded C programs. Our experiments show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy with only moderate runtime overhead.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Markus Kusano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kusano:Markus", "Chao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Chao"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
