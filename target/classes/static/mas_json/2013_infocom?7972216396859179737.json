We design a system called PPBD to stop pirated content propagation by utilizing several attacking methods. First, the system can efficiently deal with massive concurrent connections to reduce bandwidth consumption, schedule peers to cooperate and optimize the protection methods according to clients. Second, we construct two mathematical models for BT DHT attacks, and we theoretically analyze the system performance. Third, we take into account some countermeasures of different BT clients and make corresponding optimizations of our PPBD system. Our realworld experiments show that: (1) our system can extend the download duration at least three times by the fake-block attacking method and it is more effective in a small swarm; (2) DHT index poison and routing pollution methods can limit the sharing swarm to a small swarm.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Temple University"], "authors": ["Hongli Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Hongli", "Jiantao Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jiantao", "Lin Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Lin", "Xiaojiang Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Xiaojiang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
