The loose coupling of components in such systems makes it easy to vary the deployment. At the same time, the complexity to estimate the behavior and performance of the whole system is increased, which complicates capacity planning. In this paper, we present an automated performance prediction method supporting capacity planning for event-based systems. The performance prediction is based on an extended version of the Palladio Component Model - a performance meta-model for component-based systems. We apply this method on a real-world case study of a traffic monitoring system. In addition to the application of our performance prediction techniques for capacity planning, we evaluate the prediction results against measurements in the context of the case study. The results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Center for Information Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Christoph Rathfelder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rathfelder:Christoph", "Samuel Kounev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kounev:Samuel", "David Evans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Evans_0002:David"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
