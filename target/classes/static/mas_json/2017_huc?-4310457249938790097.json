We discuss how applications could support the notion of calmness, and describe a prototype \"calm display\" which we deployed in an initial n=1 study to help understand this space further.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jan Kucera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kucera:Jan", "James Scott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scott:James", "Nicholas Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Nicholas"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
