This characterisation is contrasted with other discussions of personal informatics and the quantified self. The paper reports an interview study with activity tracker users. The study found: people do not logically organise, but interweave various activity trackers, sometimes with ostensibly the same functionality; that tracking is often social and collaborative rather than personal; that there are different styles of tracking, including goal driven tracking and documentary tracking; and that tracking information is often used and interpreted with reference to daily or short term goals and decision making. We suggest there will be difficulties in personal informatics if we ignore the way that personal tracking is enmeshed with everyday life and people's outlook on their future.", "citation": "Citations (296)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["John Rooksby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rooksby:John", "Mattias Rost.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rost:Mattias", "Alistair Morrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morrison:Alistair", "Matthew Chalmers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chalmers:Matthew"], "pages": 10}
