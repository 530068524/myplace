Reuse detection serves as be the basis for many applications. However, along with the explosion of Internet and continuously growing uses of user generated mediums, the task becomes more critical and difficult. In this paper, we present a novel efficient and scalable approach to detect content reuse. We propose a new signature generation algorithm, which is based on learned hash functions for words. In order to deal with tens of billions of documents, we implement the detection approach on graphical processing units (GPUs). The experimental comparison in this paper involves studies of efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach in different types of document collections, including ClueWeb09, Tweets2011, and so on. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve the same detection rates with state-of-the-art systems while uses significantly less execution time than them (from 400X to 1500X speedup).", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Qi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Qi", "Yan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yan", "Zhuoye Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Zhuoye", "Xuanjing Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xuanjing"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
