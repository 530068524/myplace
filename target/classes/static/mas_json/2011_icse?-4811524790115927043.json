Using in-depth semi-structured interviewing we invited practitioners to reflect on their experiences and selected three to use as exemplars or case studies. In documenting some details of attempts to deploy model driven practices, we identify some 'lessons learned', in particular the importance of complex organizational, managerial and social factors - as opposed to simple technical factors - in the relative success, or failure, of the endeavour. As an example of organizational change management the successful deployment of model driven engineering appears to require: a progressive and iterative approach; transparent organizational commitment and motivation; integration with existing organizational processes and a clear business focus.", "citation": "Citations (199)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["John Edward Hutchinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hutchinson:John_Edward", "Mark Rouncefield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rouncefield:Mark", "Jon Whittle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittle:Jon"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
