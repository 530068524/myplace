However, the composition is prone to producing semantically conflicting interactions among the services. For example, in an interdepartmental business collaboration through Web services, the decision by the marketing department to clear out the inventory might be inconsistent with the decision by the operations department to increase production. Resolving semantic conflicts is challenging especially when services are loosely coupled and their interactions are not carefully governed. To address this problem, we propose a novel distributed service choreography framework. We deploy safety constraints to prevent conflicting behavior and enforce reliable and efficient service interactions via federated publish/subscribe messaging, along with strategic placement of distributed choreography agents and coordinators to minimize runtime overhead. Experimental results show that our framework prevents semantic conflicts with negligible overhead and scales better than a centralized approach by up to 60%.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Young Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Young", "Chunyang Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Chunyang", "Hans-Arno Jacobsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobsen:Hans=Arno"], "conf": "www", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
