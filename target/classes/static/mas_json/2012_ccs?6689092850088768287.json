{"title": "Resource-freeing attacks: improve your cloud performance (at your neighbor's expense).", "fields": ["multiplexing", "virtual machine", "workload", "virtualization", "testbed"], "abstract": "Cloud computing promises great efficiencies by multiplexing resources among disparate customers. For example, Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Microsoft Azure, Google's Compute Engine, and Rack-space Hosting all offer Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions that pack multiple customer virtual machines (VMs) onto the same physical server.   The gained efficiencies have some cost: past work has shown that the performance of one customer's VM can suffer due to interference from another. In experiments on a local testbed, we found that the performance of a cache-sensitive benchmark can degrade by more than 80% because of interference from another VM.   This interference incentivizes a new class of attacks, that we call resource-freeing attacks (RFAs). The goal is to modify the workload of a victim VM in a way that frees up resources for the attacker's VM. We explore in depth a particular example of an RFA. Counter-intuitively, by adding load to a co-resident victim, the attack speeds up a class of cache-bound workloads. In a controlled lab setting we show that this can improve performance of synthetic benchmarks by up to 60% over not running the attack. In the noisier setting of Amazon's EC2, we still show improvements of up to 13%.", "citation": "Citations (141)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Venkatanathan Varadarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varadarajan:Venkatanathan", "Thawan Kooburat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kooburat:Thawan", "Benjamin Farley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farley:Benjamin", "Thomas Ristenpart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ristenpart:Thomas", "Michael M.
