In observing people's interactions in the \"sprawling public sphere\" across multiple social media tools in both political and non-political spaces, we found that social media supported the interactional dimensions of deliberative democracy--the interaction with media and the interaction between people. People used multiple tools through which they: were serendipitously exposed to diverse political information, constructed diverse information feeds, disseminated diverse information, and engaged in respectful and reasoned political discussions with diverse audiences. When people's civic agency was inhibited when using a tool, they often adopted, or switched to, alternative media that could afford what they were trying to achieve. Contrary to the polarization perspective, we find that people were purposefully seeking diverse information and discussants. Some individuals altered their views as a result of the interactions they were having in the online public sphere.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Hawaii at Manoa", "University of Hawaii at Manoa", "University of Hawaii at Manoa", "University of Hawaii at Manoa"], "authors": ["Bryan C.
