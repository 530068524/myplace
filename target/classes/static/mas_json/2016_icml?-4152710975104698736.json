By combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a generative adversarial network (GAN) we can use learned feature representations in the GAN discriminator as basis for the VAE reconstruction objective. Thereby, we replace element-wise errors with feature-wise errors to better capture the data distribution while offering invariance towards e.g. translation. We apply our method to images of faces and show that it outperforms VAEs with element-wise similarity measures in terms of visual fidelity. Moreover, we show that the method learns an embedding in which high-level abstract visual features (e.g. wearing glasses) can be modified using simple arithmetic.", "citation": "Citations (334)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technical University of Denmark", "University of Copenhagen", "Twitter", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Anders Boesen Lindbo Larsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsen:Anders_Boesen_Lindbo", "S\u00f8ren Kaae S\u00f8nderby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=oslash=nderby:S=oslash=ren_Kaae", "Hugo Larochelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larochelle:Hugo", "Ole Winther.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winther:Ole"], "pages": 9}
