Bootstrapping in the latest implementation of FHE, the HElib library of Halevi and Shoup (Crypto 2014), requires about six minutes. We present a new method to homomorphically compute simple bit operations, and refresh (bootstrap) the resulting output, which runs on a personal computer in just about half a second. We present a detailed technical analysis of the scheme (based on the worst-case hardness of standard lattice problems) and report on the performance of our prototype implementation.", "citation": "Citations (181)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["L\u00e9o Ducas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ducas:L=eacute=o", "Daniele Micciancio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micciancio:Daniele"], "pages": 24}
