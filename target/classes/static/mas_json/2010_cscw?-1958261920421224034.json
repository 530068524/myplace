{"title": "A sequence transformation algorithm for supporting cooperative work on mobile devices.", "fields": ["sequence transformation", "remote operation", "data consistency", "operational transformation", "mobile search"], "abstract": "Operational transformation (OT) is a promising technique for supporting collaboration using mobile devices because it allows users to work on local data replicas even in a disconnected mode. However, as work goes mobile, a large number of operations may accumulate, defying the capacity of current OT algorithms that are mostly designed for real-time group editing. Since their assumption is that operations are propagated frequently, they generally only address how to integrate one remote operation at a time. As a consequence, most algorithms take  O (|H| 2 ) to integrate one operation and thus  O (|H| 3 ) to integrate a long sequence, where  H  is the operation history. This paper proposes a novel algorithm that provides optimized transformation of long sequences, improving the time complexity to  O (|H|). Our experiments will show that it takes 59 minutes in a recent algorithm versus 1.5 seconds in this work to integrate two long sequences on a mobile device. The performance improvement is critical towards achieving desired responsiveness and group productivity in a class of mobile collaborative applications.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Nokia", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Bin Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Bin", "Du Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Du", "Ning Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Ning"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
