{"title": "Borealis-R: a replication-transparent stream processing system for wide-area monitoring applications.", "fields": ["stream processing", "operator", "multiplication operator", "data stream mining", "wide area network"], "abstract": "Borealis-R is a replication-based system for both fast and   highly-available processing of data streams over wide-area networks. In Borealis-R, multiple operator replicas send outputs to downstream replicas, allowing each replica to use whichever data arrives first. To further reduce latency, replicas run without coordination, possibly processing data in different orders. Despite this flexibility, Borealis-R guarantees that applications always receive the same results as in the non-replicated, failure-free case. In addition, Borealis-R deploys replicas at select network locations to effectively improve performance as well as availability.   We demonstrate the strengths of Borealis-R using a live wide-area monitoring application. We show that Borealis-R outperforms previous solutions in terms of latency and that it uses system resources efficiently by carefully deploying and discarding replicas.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jeong-Hyon Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Jeong=Hyon", "Sanghoon Cha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cha:Sanghoon", "Ugur \u00c7etintemel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ccedil=etintemel:Ugur", "Stanley B.
