{"title": "FrameBox and MirrorBox: tools and guidelines to support designers in prototyping interfaces for 3D displays.", "fields": ["stereo display", "usability", "paper prototyping", "dashboard", "stereoscopy"], "abstract": "In this paper, we identify design guidelines for stereoscopic 3D (S3D) user interfaces (UIs) and present the MirrorBox and the FrameBox, two UI prototyping tools for S3D displays. As auto-stereoscopy becomes available for the mass market we believe the design of S3D UIs for devices, for example, mobile phones, public displays, or car dashboards, will rapidly gain importance. A benefit of such UIs is that they can group and structure information in a way that makes them easily perceivable for the user. For example, important information can be shown in front of less important information. This paper identifies core requirements for designing S3D UIs and derives concrete guidelines. The requirements also serve as a basis for two depth layout tools we built with the aim to overcome limitations of traditional prototyping when sketching S3D UIs. We evaluated the tools with usability experts and compared them to traditional paper prototyping.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "University of Stuttgart", "BMW Research an ...
