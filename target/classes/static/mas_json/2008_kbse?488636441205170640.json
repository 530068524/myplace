Although many approaches have been proposed to identify potential aspects, a lot of manual work is typically required before these candidates can be converted into refactorable aspects. In this paper, we propose a new aspect mining approach, called clustering-based fan-in analysis (CBFA), to recommend aspect candidates in the form of method clusters, instead of single methods. CBFA uses a new lexical based clustering approach to identify method clusters and rank the clusters using a new ranking metric called cluster fan- in. Experiments on Linux and JHotDraw show that CBFA can provide accurate recommendations while improving aspect mining coverage significantly compared to other state-of-the-art mining approaches.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Danfeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Danfeng", "Yao Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo_0001:Yao", "Xiangqun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiangqun"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
