{"title": "MatchUp: Autocompletion for Mashups.", "fields": ["mashup", "glue", "user requirements document", "exploit", "web application"], "abstract": "A mashup is a Web application that integrates data, computation and GUI provided by several systems into a unique tool. The concept originated from the understanding that the number of applications available on the Web and the need for combining them to meet user requirements, are growing very rapidly. This demo presents MatchUp, a system that supports rapid, on-demand, intuitive development of mashups, based on a novel autocompletion mechanism. The key observation guiding the development of MatchUp is that mashups developed by different users typically share common characteristics; they use similar classes of mashup components and glue them together in a similar manner. MatchUp exploits these similarities to predict, given a user's partial mashup specification, what are the most likely potential completions (missing components and connection between them) for the specification. Using a novel ranking algorithm, users are then offered top-k completions from which they choose and refine according to their needs.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Serge Abiteboul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abiteboul:Serge", "Ohad Greenshpan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenshpan:Ohad", "Tova Milo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milo:Tova", "Neoklis Polyzotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polyzotis:Neoklis"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
