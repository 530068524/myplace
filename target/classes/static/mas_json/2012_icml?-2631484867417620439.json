The key idea is to use the top eigenfunctions of integral operator derived from both labeled and unlabeled examples as the basis functions and learn the prediction function by a simple linear regression. We show that under appropriate assumptions about the integral operator, this approach is able to achieve an improved regression error bound better than existing bounds of supervised learning. We also verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by an empirical study.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Michigan State University", "Zhejiang University", "Michigan State University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Ming Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Ming", "Tianbao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Tianbao", "Binbin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Binbin", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
