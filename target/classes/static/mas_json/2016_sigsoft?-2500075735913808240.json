{"title": "Deep API learning.", "fields": ["deep learning", "natural language user interface", "query expansion", "cuda", "language model"], "abstract": "Developers often wonder how to implement a certain functionality (e.g., how to parse XML files) using APIs. Obtaining an API usage sequence based on an API-related natural language query is very helpful in this regard. Given a query, existing approaches utilize information retrieval models to search for matching API sequences. These approaches treat queries and APIs as bags-of-words and lack a deep understanding of the semantics of the query. We propose DeepAPI, a deep learning based approach to generate API usage sequences for a given natural language query. Instead of a bag-of-words assumption, it learns the sequence of words in a query and the sequence of associated APIs. DeepAPI adapts a neural language model named RNN Encoder-Decoder. It encodes a word sequence (user query) into a fixed-length context vector, and generates an API sequence based on the context vector. We also augment the RNN Encoder-Decoder by considering the importance of individual APIs. We empirically evaluate our approach with more than 7 million annotated code snippets collected from GitHub. The results show that our approach generates largely accurate API sequences and outperforms the related approaches.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Xiaodong Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Xiaodong", "Hongyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hongyu", "Dongmei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dongmei", "Sunghun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Sunghun"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
