{"title": "Mile High WiFi: A First Look At In-Flight Internet Connectivity.", "fields": ["internet access", "multiplexing", "network performance", "quic", "network emulation"], "abstract": "In-Flight Communication (IFC), which can be purchased on a growing number of commercial flights, is often received by consumers with both awe for its mere availability and harsh criticism for its poor performance. Indeed, IFC provides Internet connectivity in some of the most challenging conditions with aircraft traveling at speeds in excess of 500 mph at 30,000 feet above the ground. Yet, while existing services do provide basic Internet accessibility, anecdotal reports rank their quality of service as, at best, poor. In this paper, we present the first characterization of deployed IFC systems. Using over 45 flight-hours of measurements, we profile the performance of IFC across the two dominant access technologies \u2013 direct air-to-ground communication (DA2GC) and mobile satellite service (MSS) \u2013 over 16 flights and six different airlines. We show that IFC QoS is in large part determined by the high latencies inherent to DA2GC and MSS, with RTTs averaging 200ms and 750ms, respectively, and that these high latencies directly impact the performance of common applications such as web browsing. In addition, we find high link loss rates for IFC \u2013 nearly 40% loss at the 90th percentile for MSS \u2013 which severely impacts the performance of TCP and other loss-based congestion control protocols. We extend our IFC study exploring the potential of alternative transport protocols and upcoming technology improvements. Using empirically derived emulation we evaluate the performance of the newly released HTTP/2 and QUIC protocols, finding that QUIC is able to improve page load times by as much as 7.9 times. In addition, we find that HTTP/2\u2019s use of multiplexing multiple requests onto a single TCP connection performs up to 4.8x worse than HTTP/1.1 when faced with large numbers of objects. We use network emulation to explore proposed technological improvements to existing IFC systems finding that high link losses account for the largest factor of performance degradation, and that to improving link bandwidth does little to improve the quality of experience for applications such as web browsing.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["John P.
