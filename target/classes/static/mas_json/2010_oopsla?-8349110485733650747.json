{"title": "Pinocchio: bringing reflection to life with first-class interpreters.", "fields": ["program transformation", "interpreter", "metaprogramming", "smalltalk", "runtime system"], "abstract": "To support development tools like debuggers, runtime systems need to provide a meta-programming interface to alter their semantics and access internal data. Reflective capabilities are typically fixed by the Virtual Machine (VM). Unanticipated reflective features must either be simulated by complex program transformations, or they require the development of a specially tailored VM. We propose a novel approach to behavioral reflection that eliminates the barrier between applications and the VM by manipulating an explicit tower of first-class interpreters. Pinocchio is a proof-of-concept implementation of our approach which enables radical changes to the interpretation of programs by explicitly instantiating subclasses of the base interpreter. We illustrate the design of Pinocchio through non-trivial examples that extend runtime semantics to support debugging, parallel debugging, and back-in-time object-flow debugging. Although performance is not yet addressed, we also discuss numerous opportunities for optimization, which we believe will lead to a practical approach to behavioral reflection.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Bern", "University of Bern", "University of Bern", "University of Bern", "University of Bern"], "authors": ["Toon Verwaest.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verwaest:Toon", "Camillo Bruni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruni:Camillo", "David Gurtner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurtner:David", "Adrian Lienhard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lienhard:Adrian", "Oscar Nierstrasz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nierstrasz:Oscar"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2010", "pages": 16}
