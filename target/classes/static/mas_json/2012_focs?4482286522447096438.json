An instance of the problem is specified by a sum of cost functions from the language with the goal to minimise the sum. This framework includes and generalises well-studied constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and maximum constraint satisfaction problems (Max-CSPs). Our main result is a precise algebraic characterisation of valued constraint languages whose instances can be solved exactly by the basic linear programming relaxation. Using this result, we obtain tractability of several novel and previously widely-open classes of VCSPs, including problems over valued constraint languages that are: (1) sub modular on arbitrary lattices, (2) bisubmodular (also known as k-sub modular) on arbitrary finite domains, (3) weakly (and hence strongly) tree-sub modular on arbitrary trees.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "University of Warwick"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Johan Thapper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thapper:Johan", "Stanislav Zivny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zivny:Stanislav"], "pages": 10}
