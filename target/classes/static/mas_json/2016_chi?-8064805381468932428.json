{"title": "DigitSpace: Designing Thumb-to-Fingers Touch Interfaces for One-Handed and Eyes-Free Interactions.", "fields": ["touchpad", "stylus", "human computer interaction", "thumb", "computer science"], "abstract": "Thumb-to-fingers interfaces augment touch widgets on fingers, which are manipulated by the thumb. Such interfaces are ideal for one-handed eyes-free input since touch widgets on the fingers enable easy access by the stylus thumb. This study presents DigitSpace, a thumb-to-fingers interface that addresses two ergonomic factors: hand anatomy and touch precision. Hand anatomy restricts possible movements of a thumb, which further influences the physical comfort during the interactions. Touch precision is a human factor that determines how precisely users can manipulate touch widgets set on fingers, which determines effective layouts of the widgets. Buttons and touchpads were considered in our studies to enable discrete and continuous input in an eyes-free manner. The first study explores the regions of fingers where the interactions can be comfortably performed. According to the comfort regions, the second and third studies explore effective layouts for button and touchpad widgets. The experimental results indicate that participants could discriminate at least 16 buttons on their fingers. For touchpad, participants were asked to perform unistrokes. Our results revealed that since individual participant performed a coherent writing behavior, personalized $1 recognizers could offer 92% accuracy on a cross-finger touchpad. A series of design guidelines are proposed for designers, and a DigitSpace prototype that uses magnetic-tracking methods is demonstrated.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Da-Yuan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Da=Yuan", "Li-Wei Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Li=Wei", "Shuo Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shuo", "Fan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Fan", "Rong-Hao Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Rong=Hao", "De-Nian Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:De=Nian", "Yi-Ping Hung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hung:Yi=Ping", "Bing-Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bing=Yu"], "pages": 12}
