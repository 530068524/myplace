The basic idea is to decouple optimization from the operative system by means of a secondary optimization system, which bears the burden of determining new query plans. Within the secondary system, which typically runs on a separate machine, we utilize suitable statistical models of the original data streams to simulate them. As the simulation can run at much faster rates, we are able to examine and assess new query plans in a shorter period of time without running the risk of deteriorating the original plan; we only migrate practically approved plans into the operative system. In our demonstration, we will present our prototypical implementation of this optimization architecture. We will demonstrate the interaction between primary and secondary system as well as the key features of the whole optimization process.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Marburg", "University of Marburg", "University of Marburg", "University of Marburg"], "authors": ["Christoph Heinz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinz:Christoph", "J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00e4mer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=auml=mer:J=uuml=rgen", "Tobias Riemenschneider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riemenschneider:Tobias", "Bernhard Seeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seeger:Bernhard"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
