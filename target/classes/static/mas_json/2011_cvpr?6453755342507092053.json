{"title": "Unsupervised local color correction for coarsely registered images.", "fields": ["color histogram", "color correction", "color balance", "color normalization", "color quantization"], "abstract": "The current paper proposes a new parametric local color correction technique. Initially, several color transfer functions are computed from the output of the mean shift color segmentation algorithm. Secondly, color influence maps are calculated. Finally, the contribution of every color transfer function is merged using the weights from the color influence maps. The proposed approach is compared with both global and local color correction approaches. Results show that our method outperforms the technique ranked first in a recent performance evaluation on this topic. Moreover, the proposed approach is computed in about one tenth of the time.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Aveiro", "University of Aveiro", "Computer Vision ... arcelona, Spain"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Miguel Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveira:Miguel", "Angel Domingo Sappa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sappa:Angel_Domingo", "V\u00edtor M.
