{"title": "Patch to the Future: Unsupervised Visual Prediction.", "fields": ["computer vision", "pattern recognition", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In this paper we present a conceptually simple but surprisingly powerful method for visual prediction which combines the effectiveness of mid-level visual elements with temporal modeling. Our framework can be learned in a completely unsupervised manner from a large collection of videos. However, more importantly, because our approach models the prediction framework on these mid-level elements, we can not only predict the possible motion in the scene but also predict visual appearances--how are appearances going to change with time. This yields a visual \"hallucination\" of probable events on top of the scene. We show that our method is able to accurately predict and visualize simple future events, we also show that our approach is comparable to supervised methods for event prediction.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jacob Walker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walker:Jacob", "Abhinav Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Abhinav", "Martial Hebert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hebert:Martial"], "pages": 8}
