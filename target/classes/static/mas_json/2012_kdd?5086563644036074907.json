{"title": "Coupled behavior analysis for capturing coupling relationships in group-based market manipulations.", "fields": ["market manipulation", "implementation", "hierarchical clustering", "statistical relational learning", "domain knowledge"], "abstract": "In stock markets, an emerging challenge for surveillance is that a group of hidden manipulators collaborate with each other to manipulate the price movement of securities. Recently, the coupled hidden Markov model (CHMM)-based  coupled behavior analysis  (CBA) has been proposed to consider the coupling relationships in the above group-based behaviors for manipulation detection. From the modeling perspective, however, this requires overall aggregation of the behavioral data to cater for the CHMM modeling, which does not differentiate the coupling relationships presented in different forms within the aggregated behaviors and degrade the capability for further anomaly detection. Thus, this paper suggests a general CBA framework for detecting  group-based market manipulation  by capturing more comprehensive couplings and proposes two variant implementations, which are  hybrid coupling  (HC)-based and  hierarchical grouping  (HG)-based respectively. The proposed framework consists of three stages. The first stage,  qualitative  analysis, generates possible qualitative coupling relationships between behaviors with or without domain knowledge. In the second stage,  quantitative  representation of coupled behaviors is learned via proper methods. For the third stage, anomaly detection algorithms are proposed to cater for different application scenarios. Experimental results on data from a major Asian stock market show that the proposed framework outperforms the CHMM-based analysis in terms of detecting abnormal collaborative market manipulations. Additionally, the two different implementations are compared with their effectiveness for different application scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Vermont", "Shanghai Stock  ...
