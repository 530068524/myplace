We prove that despite heterogeneity of node lifetimes, different initial out-degree, non-Poisson arrival/failure dynamics, and complex spatial and temporal dependency among creation of both initial and replacement edges, a superposition of edge-arrival processes to a live node under uniform selection converges to a Poisson process when system size becomes sufficiently large. Due to the convoluted dependency and non-renewal nature of various point processes, this result significantly advances classical Poisson convergence analysis and offers a simple analytical platform for future modeling of networks under churn in a wide range of degree-regular and -irregular graphs with arbitrary node lifetime distributions.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Dayton", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Zhongmei Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Zhongmei", "Daren B.
