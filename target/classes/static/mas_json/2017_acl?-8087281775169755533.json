We use labeled data from a high-resource language to increase performance on a low-resource language. In experiments on 21 language pairs from four different language families, we obtain up to 58% higher accuracy than without transfer and show that even zero-shot and one-shot learning are possible. We further find that the degree of language relatedness strongly influences the ability to transfer morphological knowledge.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Johns Hopkins University", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Katharina Kann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kann:Katharina", "Ryan Cotterell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cotterell:Ryan", "Hinrich Sch\u00fctze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=tze:Hinrich"], "pages": 11}
