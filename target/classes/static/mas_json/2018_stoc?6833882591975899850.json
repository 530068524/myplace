{"title": "Shadow tomography of quantum states.", "fields": ["quantum state", "combinatorics", "postselection", "tomography", "quantum money", "open problem", "quantum", "shadow", "pure mathematics"], "abstract": "We introduce the problem of *shadow tomography*: given an unknown  D -dimensional quantum mixed state \u03c1, as well as known two-outcome measurements  E  1 ,\u2026, E   M  , estimate the probability that  E   i   accepts \u03c1, to within additive error e, for each of the  M  measurements. How many copies of \u03c1 are needed to achieve this, with high probability? Surprisingly, we give a procedure that solves the problem by measuring only  O ( e \u22125 \u00b7log 4   M \u00b7log D ) copies. This means, for example, that we can learn the behavior of an arbitrary  n -qubit state, on *all* accepting/rejecting circuits of some fixed polynomial size, by measuring only  n   O ( 1)  copies of the state. This resolves an open problem of the author, which arose from his work on private-key quantum money schemes, but which also has applications to quantum copy-protected software, quantum advice, and quantum one-way communication. Recently, building on this work, Brandao et al. have given a different approach to shadow tomography using semidefinite programming, which achieves a savings in computation time.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Scott Aaronson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aaronson:Scott"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2018", "pages": 14}
