{"title": "Tracking \"gross community happiness\" from tweets.", "fields": ["happiness", "census", "normalization", "subjective well being", "welfare"], "abstract": "Policy makers are calling for new socio-economic measures that reflect subjective well-being, to complement traditional measures of material welfare as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Self-reporting has been found to be reasonably accurate in measuring one's well-being and conveniently tallies with sentiment expressed on social media (e.g., those satisfied with life use more positive than negative words in their Facebook status updates). Social media content can thus be used to track well-being of individuals. A question left unexplored is whether such content can be used to track well-being of entire physical communities as well. To this end, we consider Twitter users based in a variety of London census communities, and study the relationship between sentiment expressed in tweets and community socio-economic well-being. We find that the two are highly correlated: the higher the normalized sentiment score of a community's tweets, the higher the community's socio-economic well-being. This suggests that monitoring tweets is an effective way of tracking community well-being too.", "citation": "Citations (129)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University College London", "University College London", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Daniele Quercia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quercia:Daniele", "Jonathan Ellis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ellis:Jonathan", "Licia Capra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capra:Licia", "Jon Crowcroft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crowcroft:Jon"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
