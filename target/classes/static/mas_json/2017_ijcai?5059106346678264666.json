A common representation for such models is the snapshot model - where a network is defined at logical time-stamps. An important problem under this model is change point detection. In this work we devise an effective and efficient three-step-approach for detecting change points in dynamic networks under the snapshot model. Our algorithm achieves up to 9X speedup over the state-of-the-art while improving quality on both synthetic and real world networks.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Yu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yu", "Aniket Chakrabarti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakrabarti:Aniket", "David Sivakoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sivakoff:David", "Srinivasan Parthasarathy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parthasarathy_0001:Srinivasan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
