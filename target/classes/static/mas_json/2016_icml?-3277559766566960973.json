As our main contribution, we provide new sample near-linear time algorithms for the problem that - while not being minimax optimal - achieve a significantly better sample-time tradeoff on large datasets compared to the DP approach. Our experimental evaluation shows that, compared with the DP approach, our algorithms provide a convergence rate that is only off by a factor of 2 to 4, while achieving speedups of three orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Southern California", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jayadev Acharya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acharya:Jayadev", "Ilias Diakonikolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakonikolas:Ilias", "Jerry Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Jerry", "Ludwig Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Ludwig"], "pages": 9}
