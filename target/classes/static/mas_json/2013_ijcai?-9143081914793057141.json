{"title": "Exchanging OWL 2 QL Knowledge Bases.", "fields": ["conjunctive query", "data exchange", "web ontology language", "exptime", "description logic"], "abstract": "Knowledge base exchange is an important problem in the area of data exchange and knowledge representation, where one is interested in exchanging information between a source and a target knowledge base connected through a mapping. In this paper, we study this fundamental problem for knowledge bases and mappings expressed in OWL2 QL, the profile of OWL2 based on the description logic DL-LiteR. More specifically, we consider the problem of computing universal solutions, identified as one of the most desirable translations to be materialized, and the problem of computing UCQ-representations, which optimally capture in a target TBox the information that can be extracted from a source TBox and a mapping by means of unions of conjunctive queries. For the former we provide a novel automata-theoretic technique, and complexity results that range from NP to EXPTIME, while for the latter we show NLOGSPACE-completeness.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Free U. of Bolzano, Italy", "Free U. of Bolz ... ienna, Austria", "Free U. of Bolzano, Italy"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Marcelo Arenas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arenas:Marcelo", "Elena Botoeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Botoeva:Elena", "Diego Calvanese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calvanese:Diego", "Vladislav Ryzhikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryzhikov:Vladislav"], "pages": 8}
