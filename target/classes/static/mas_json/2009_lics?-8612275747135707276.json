For the NBW to NCW translation, the currently known upper bound is $2^{O(n \\log n)}$ and the lower bound is $1.5n$. We improve the upper bound to $n2^n$ and describe a matching lower bound of$2^{\\Omega(n)}$. For the NBW to DCW translation, the currently known upper bound is $2^{O(n \\log n)}$. We improve it to $2^{O(n)}$, which is asymptotically tight. Both of our upper-bound constructions are based on a simple subset construction, do not involve intermediate automata with richer acceptance conditions, and can be implemented symbolically. We point to numerous applications of the new constructions. In particular, they imply a simple subset-construction based translation(when possible) of LTL to deterministic B\\\"uchi word automata.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Udi Boker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boker:Udi", "Orna Kupferman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kupferman:Orna"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
