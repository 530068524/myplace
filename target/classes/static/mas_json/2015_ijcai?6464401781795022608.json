{"title": "Data Complexity of Query Answering in Description Logics (Extended Abstract).", "fields": ["abox", "conjunctive query", "boolean conjunctive query", "description logic", "expressive power"], "abstract": "We study the data complexity of answering conjunctive queries over Description Logic knowledge bases constituted by a TBox and an ABox. In particular, we are interested in characterizing the FOrewritability and the polynomial tractability boundaries of conjunctive query answering, depending on the expressive power of the DL used to express the knowledge base. What emerges from our complexity analysis is that the Description Logics of the DL-Lite family are essentially the maximal logics allowing for conjunctive query answering through standard database technology.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "authors": ["Diego Calvanese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calvanese:Diego", "Giuseppe De Giacomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giacomo:Giuseppe_De", "Domenico Lembo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lembo:Domenico", "Maurizio Lenzerini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lenzerini:Maurizio", "Riccardo Rosati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosati:Riccardo"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 5}
