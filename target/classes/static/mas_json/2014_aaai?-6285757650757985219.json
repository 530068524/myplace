{"title": "Incentives for Truthful Information Elicitation of Continuous Signals.", "fields": ["truth serum", "prior probability", "collective intelligence", "incentive", "mechanism design"], "abstract": "We consider settings where a collective intelligence is formed by aggregating information contributed from many independent agents, such as product reviews, community sensing, or opinion polls. We propose a novel mechanism that elicits both private signals and beliefs. The mechanism extends the previous versions of the Bayesian Truth Serum (the original BTS, the RBTS, and the multi-valued BTS), by allowing small populations and non-binary private signals, while not requiring additional assumptions on the belief updating process. For priors that are sufficiently smooth, such as Gaussians, the mechanism allows signals to be continuous.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Goran Radanovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radanovic:Goran", "Boi Faltings.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faltings:Boi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
