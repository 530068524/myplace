{"title": "Breaking Value Symmetry.", "fields": ["scheduling", "time complexity", "homogeneous space", "constraint satisfaction problem", "computational complexity theory"], "abstract": "Symmetry is an important factor in solving many constraint satisfaction problems. One common type of symmetry is when we have symmetric values. In a recent series of papers, we have studied methods to break value symmetries (Walsh 2006a; 2007). Our results identify computational limits on eliminating value symmetry. For instance, we prove that pruning all symmetric values is NP-hard in general. Nevertheless, experiments show that much value symmetry can be broken in practice. These results may be useful to researchers in planning, scheduling and other areas as value symmetry occurs in many different domains.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["NICTA"], "authors": ["Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
