In this demonstration we show  Glacier , a library and a compiler that can be employed to implement streaming queries as hardware circuits on FPGAs.  Glacier  consists of a library of compositional hardware modules that represent stream processing operators. Given a query execution plan, the compiler instantiates the corresponding components and wires them up to a digital circuit. The goal of this demo is to show the flexibility of the compositional approach.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ren\u00e9 M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Ren=eacute=", "Jens Teubner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teubner:Jens", "Gustavo Alonso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alonso:Gustavo"], "pages": 4}
