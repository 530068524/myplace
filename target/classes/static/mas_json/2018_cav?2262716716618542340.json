Population protocols are a model of computation very much studied by the distributed computing community, in which mobile anonymous agents interact stochastically to achieve a common task. Peregrine allows users to design protocols, to simulate them both manually and automatically, to gather statistics of properties such as convergence speed, and to verify correctness automatically. This paper describes the features of Peregrine and their implementation.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Michael Blondin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blondin:Michael", "Javier Esparza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esparza:Javier", "Stefan Jaax.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaax:Stefan"], "pages": 8}
