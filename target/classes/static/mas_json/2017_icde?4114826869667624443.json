This world includes people, animals, vehicles, drones, and vessels, to name a few. The conventional spatial libraries including Microsoft SQL Server Spatial (SqlSpatial) are primarily developed to evaluate spatial operations on stationary things. When it comes to real-world applications for the Internet of Moving Things that require realtime tracking and processing, the limitations of these libraries float to the surface. Unfortunately, the SqlSpatial library has very limited operations in this domain. This paper presents the Reactive eXtension Spatial (RxSpatial) library developed to provide real-time processing of spatio-temporal operations on moving objects connected through the Internet of Things. The superiority of the RxSpatial over the basic SqlSpatial is demonstrated throughout extensive experimental evaluations on real and synthetic data sets.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Microsoft", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Abdeltawab M.
