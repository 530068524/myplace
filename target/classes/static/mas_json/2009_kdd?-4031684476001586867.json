{"title": "Predicting bounce rates in sponsored search advertisements.", "fields": ["simulation", "search engine", "return on investment", "bounce rate", "leverage"], "abstract": "This paper explores an important and relatively unstudied quality measure of a sponsored search advertisement: bounce rate. The  bounce rate  of an ad can be informally defined as the fraction of users who click on the ad but almost immediately move on to other tasks. A high bounce rate can lead to poor advertiser return on investment, and suggests search engine users may be having a poor experience following the click. In this paper, we first provide quantitative analysis showing that bounce rate is an effective measure of user satisfaction. We then address the question,  can we predict bounce rate by analyzing the features of the advertisement?  An affirmative answer would allow advertisers and search engines to predict the effectiveness and quality of advertisements before they are shown. We propose solutions to this problem involving large-scale learning methods that leverage features drawn from ad creatives in addition to their keywords and landing pages.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["D.
