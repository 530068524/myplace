{"title": "Adaptive video streaming over whitespace: SVC for 3-Tiered spectrum sharing.", "fields": ["video quality", "quality of experience", "radio spectrum", "whitespace", "testbed"], "abstract": "The recently proposed 3-Tier access model for Whitespace by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandates certain classes of devices to share frequency bands in space and time. These devices are envisioned to be a heterogeneous mixture of licensed (Tier-1 and Tier-2) and unlicensed, opportunistic devices (Tier-3). The hierarchy in accessing the channel calls for superior adaptation of Tier-3 devices with varying spectral opportunity. While policies are being ratified for efficient sharing, it also calls for redesigning many common applications to adapt to this novel paradigm. In this paper, we focus on the ever-increasing demand for video streaming and present a methodology suitable for Tier-3 devices in the shared access model. Our analysis begins with a stress test of commonly adopted video streaming methods under the new sharing model. This is followed by the design of a robust MDP-based solution that proactively adapts to fast-varying channel conditions, providing better user quality of experience when compared to existing solutions, such as MPEG-DASH. We evaluate our solution on an experimental testbed and find that our MDP-based algorithm outperforms DASH, and partial information of Tier-2 dynamics improves video quality.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Xiaoli Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaoli", "Jiasi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiasi", "Aveek Dutta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dutta:Aveek", "Mung Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang:Mung"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
