Rather than appealing to annotation-driven syntactic modeling, we address this problem by observing the influential role of function words in determining syntactic structure, and introducing soft constraints on function word relationships as part of a standard log-linear hierarchical phrase-based model. Experimentation on Chinese-English and Arabic-English translation demonstrates that the approach yields significant gains in performance.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "National University of Singapore", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Institute for I ... rch, Singapore"], "authors": ["Hendra Setiawan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Setiawan:Hendra", "Min-Yen Kan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kan:Min=Yen", "Haizhou Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Haizhou", "Philip Resnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Resnik:Philip"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
