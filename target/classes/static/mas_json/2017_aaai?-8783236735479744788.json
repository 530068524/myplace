Recently, PCCA has been extended to bilinear\ncases for dealing with two-view matrices in order to\npreserve and exploit the matrix structures in PCCA. However,\nexisting bilinear PCCAs impose restrictive model assumptions\nfor matrix structure preservation, sacrificing generative\ncorrectness or model flexibility. To overcome these\ndrawbacks, we propose BPCCA, a new bilinear extension of\nPCCA, by introducing a hybrid joint model. Our new model\npreserves matrix structures indirectly via hybrid vector-based\nand matrix-based concatenations. This enables BPCCA to\ngain more model flexibility in capturing two-view correlations\nand obtain close-form solutions in parameter estimation.\nExperimental results on two real-world applications demonstrate\nthe superior performance of BPCCA over competing\nmethods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hong Kong Baptist University"], "authors": ["Yang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yang", "Haiping Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Haiping", "Yiu-ming Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Yiu=ming"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
