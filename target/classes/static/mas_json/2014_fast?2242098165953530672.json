{"title": "Wear unleveling: improving NAND flash lifetime by balancing page endurance.", "fields": ["computer science", "real time computing", "nand gate", "parallel computing", "flash memory"], "abstract": "Flash memory cells typically undergo a few thousand Program/Erase (P/E) cycles before they wear out. However, the programming strategy of flash devices and process variations cause some flash cells to wear out significantly faster than others. This paper studies this variability on two commercial devices, acknowledges its unavoidability, figures out how to identify the weakest cells, and introduces a wear unbalancing technique that let the strongest cells relieve the weak ones in order to lengthen the overall lifetime of the device. Our technique periodically skips or relieves the weakest pages whenever a flash block is programmed. Relieving the weakest pages can lead to a lifetime extension of up to 60% for a negligible memory and storage overhead, while minimally affecting (sometimes improving) the write performance. Future technology nodes will bring larger variance to page endurance, increasing the need for techniques similar to the one proposed in this work.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Xavier Jimenez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jimenez:Xavier", "David Novo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novo:David", "Paolo Ienne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ienne:Paolo"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2014", "pages": 13}
