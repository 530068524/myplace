Our approach decomposes multiple unicast sessions into a superposition of multicast and unicast sessions, with coding occurring only within each session. We give an optimization approach that is more general than the existing poison-remedy optimization formulation. For the case of wireless, we consider XOR coding and give an achievable rate region for a primary interference model. To simplify network operation, we give an oblivious backpressure algorithm which does not optimize overhearing of transmissions, and a practical protocol called COPR based on the oblivious backpressure algorithm. Simulation experiments show that COPR largely reduces network power consumption over existing algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (159)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Tao Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Tao", "Lijun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Lijun", "Tracey Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Tracey"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 5}
