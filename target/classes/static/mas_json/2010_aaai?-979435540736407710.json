One shortcoming of current SCM models is that their trust models are ad hoc and do not have a strong theoretical basis. We propose a trust model for SCM that is grounded in probabilistic game theory. In this model, trust can be gained through direct interactions, and/or by asking for information from other trustworthy agents. We will use this model to simulate and study supply chain market behavior.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore"], "authors": ["Yasaman Haghpanah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haghpanah:Yasaman", "Marie desJardins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/desJardins:Marie"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
