This paper proposes a novel part-based model built upon poselets, a notion of parts, and Markov Random Field (MRF) for modelling the human body structure under the variation of human poses and viewpoints. The problem of human detection is then formulated as maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in the MRF model. Variational mean field method, a robust statistical inference, is adopted to approximate the MAP estimation. The proposed method was evaluated and compared with existing methods on different test sets including H3D and PASCAL VOC 2007-2009. Experimental results have favourbly shown the robustness of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Duc Thanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Duc_Thanh", "Minh-Khoi Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran:Minh=Khoi", "Sai-Kit Yeung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeung:Sai=Kit"], "pages": 9}
