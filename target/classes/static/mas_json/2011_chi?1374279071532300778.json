In this paper, we present a way to directly interact with them through live video on mobile devices. We extend the Touch Projector interface to accommodate multiple users by showing individual content on the mobile display that would otherwise clutter the facade's canvas or distract other users. To demonstrate our concept, we built two collaborative multi-user applications: (1) painting on the facade and (2) solving a 15-puzzle. We gathered informal feedback during the ARS Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria and found that our interaction technique is (1) considered easy-to-learn, but (2) may leave users unaware of the actions of others.", "citation": "Citations (103)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sebastian Boring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boring:Sebastian", "Sven Gehring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehring:Sven", "Alexander Wiethoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiethoff:Alexander", "Anna Magdalena Bl\u00f6ckner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bl=ouml=ckner:Anna_Magdalena", "Johannes Sch\u00f6ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=ning:Johannes", "Andreas Butz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Butz:Andreas"], "pages": 4}
