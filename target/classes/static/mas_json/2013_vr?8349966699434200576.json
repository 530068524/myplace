Interrupting a particular worker degrades not only his working efficiency but also the efficiency of others. Therefore, the estimation of interruptibility of entire office is required to attain appropriate interruptions. In this study, a feasibility of automatic estimation of office interruptibility based on the camera image and sound is discussed.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Kazuaki Aoki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aoki:Kazuaki", "Shigeki Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Shigeki", "Takahiro Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Takahiro", "Kinya Fujita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujita:Kinya"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
