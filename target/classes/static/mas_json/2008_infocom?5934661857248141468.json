Considering the fact that depth information is typically available for underwater sensors, we transform the 3D underwater positioning problem into its two- dimensional counterpart via a projection technique and prove that a non-degenerative projection preserves network localizability. We further prove that given a network and a constant  k , all of the geometric  k -lateration localization methods are equivalent. Based on these results, we design a purely distributed localization framework termed USP. This framework can be applied with any ranging method proposed for 2D terrestrial sensor networks. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulation, we show that USP preserves the localizability of the original 3D network via a simple projection and improves localization capabilities when bilateration is employed. USP has low storage and computation requirements, and predictable and balanced communication overhead.", "citation": "Citations (176)", "departments": ["George Washington University", "George Washington University", "George Washington University", "George Washington University", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Wei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wei", "Amin Y.
