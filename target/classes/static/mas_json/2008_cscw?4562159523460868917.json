In this paper, we report on a qualitative study of leadership in three online communities whose members collaborate over the Internet to create computer-animated movies called \"collabs.\" Our results indicate that most collabs fail. Collab leaders face two major challenges. First, leaders must design collabora-tive projects. Second, leaders must manage artists during the collab production process. We contrast these challenges with the available empirical research on leadership in open-source software and Wikipedia, identifying four themes: originality, completion, subjectivity, and ownership. We conclude with broader implications for online creative col-laboration in its many forms.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kurt Luther.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luther:Kurt", "Amy Bruckman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruckman:Amy"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
