We characterize those alphabets for which Turing machines with atoms determinize. To this end, the determinization problem is expressed as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, and a characterization is obtained from deep results in CSP theory. As an application to Descriptive Complexity Theory, within a substantial class of relational structures including Cai-Furer-Immerman graphs, we precisely characterize those subclasses where the logic IFP+C captures order-invariant polynomial time computation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Bartek Klin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klin:Bartek", "Slawomir Lasota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lasota:Slawomir", "Joanna Ochremiak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ochremiak:Joanna", "Szymon Torunczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torunczyk:Szymon"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
