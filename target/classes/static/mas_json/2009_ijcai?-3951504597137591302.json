{"title": "Iterated Regret Minimization: A New Solution Concept.", "fields": ["bertrand competition", "iterated function", "dilemma", "centipede game", "solution concept"], "abstract": "For some well-known games, such as the Traveler\u02bcs Dilemma or the Centipede Game, traditional game-theoretic solution concepts\u2014most notably Nash equilibrium\u2014predict outcomes that are not consistent with empirical observations. We introduce a new solution concept, iterated regret minimization, that exhibits the same qualitative behavior as that observed in experiments in many games of interest, including Traveler\u02bcs Dilemma, the Centipede Game, Nash bargaining, and Bertrand competition. As the name suggests, iterated regret minimization involves the iterated deletion of strategies that do not minimize regret.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Joseph Y.
