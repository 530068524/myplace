By contrast, in this study we show that the international Twitter communication landscape is not only still largely predetermined by physical distance, but that it also depends on countries' social, economic, and cultural attributes. We describe a study of an international Twitter mention network of 13 million users across over 100 countries. We show that the  Gravity Model , which hypothesizes that the flow between two areas is proportional to their masses (which we approximate using internet penetration) and inversely proportional to the distance between them, is correlated ( r =0.68) with the international communication flow. Using this model, along with other social, economic, and cultural variables, we predict the communication volume at  Adjusted R 2   of $0.80$, with trade, language and racial intolerance especially impacting communication. We discuss the implications of these barriers to communication in the contexts of collaborative work, software design, and recommendation systems.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Pompeu Fabra University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Ruth Olimpia Garcia Gavilanes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavilanes:Ruth_Olimpia_Garcia", "Yelena Mejova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mejova:Yelena", "Daniele Quercia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quercia:Daniele"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
