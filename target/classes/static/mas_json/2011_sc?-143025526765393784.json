We exploit these properties to stream data from disk in a single pass and concurrently evaluate batch queries. The combination of sequential I/O and data sharing improves performance by an order of magnitude when compared with direct evaluation of each query. The technique also supports distributed evaluation of queries in a database cluster, assembling the partial sums from each node at the query mediator. Interpolation is fundamental to computational turbulence, over 95% of queries use these routines, and the partial sums method allows the JHU Turbulence Database Cluster to realize scale and throughput for our scientists' data-intensive workloads.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "authors": ["Kalin Kanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanov:Kalin", "Eric A.
