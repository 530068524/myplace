{"title": "Using wearable sensors and real time inference to understand human recall of routine activities.", "fields": ["recall", "inference engine", "benchmarking", "experience sampling method", "annoyance"], "abstract": "Users' ability to accurately recall frequent, habitual activities is fundamental to a number of disciplines, from health sciences to machine learning. However, few, if any, studies exist that have assessed optimal sampling strategies for  in situ  self-reports. In addition, few technologies exist that facilitate benchmarking self-report accuracy for routine activities. We report on a study investigating the effect of sampling frequency of self-reports of two routine activities (sitting and walking) on recall accuracy and annoyance. We used a novel wearable sensor platform that runs a real time activity inference engine to collect  in situ  ground truth. Our results suggest that a sampling frequency of five to eight times per day may yield an optimal balance of recall and annoyance. Additionally, requesting self-reports at regular, predetermined times increases accuracy while minimizing perceived annoyance since it allows participants to anticipate these requests. We discuss our results and their implications for future studies.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Predrag V.
