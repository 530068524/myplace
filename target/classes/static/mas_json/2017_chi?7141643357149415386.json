{"title": "Empowered Participation: How Citizens Use Technology in Local Governance.", "fields": ["accountability", "government", "general partnership", "citizen journalism", "civic engagement"], "abstract": "The partnership between local residents and city officials to inform policy and decision-making about government resources, or participatory governance, has been extensively studied. In addition to numerous ethnographic studies about how citizens engage in-person, there has been increased focus in HCI to understand the impact of technology on citizen participation in local governance. Building upon those studies, this paper provides unique insight from a 3-year longitudinal study on the use of online tools that were organically adapted by citizens to engage in local governance in three diverse Chicago neighborhoods. Though the responsiveness of government officials varied across communities, our results suggest that citizens use technology to heighten the visibility of their concerns, to support mechanisms of government accountability, and to provide various options for resident participation in local governance. We argue that while communities may be effective in their use of ICTs, technology may not increase their political power.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["DePaul University", "MadX, LLC., Ale ... andria, VA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sheena Erete.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erete:Sheena", "Jennifer O.
