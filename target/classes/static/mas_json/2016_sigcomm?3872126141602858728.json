And if so, who decides which applications are preferred? This discussion, known as net neutrality, goes beyond technology and is a hot political topic. In this paper we approach net neutrality from a user's perspective. Through user studies, we demonstrate that users do indeed want some services to receive preferential treatment; and their preferences have a heavy-tail: a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to work. This suggests that users should be able to decide how their traffic is treated. A crucial part to enable user preferences, is the mechanism to express them. To this end, we present network cookies, a general mechanism to express user preferences to the network. Using cookies, we prototype Boost, a user-defined fast-lane and deploy it in 161 homes.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Yiannis Yiakoumis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yiakoumis:Yiannis", "Sachin Katti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katti:Sachin", "Nick McKeown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McKeown:Nick"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
