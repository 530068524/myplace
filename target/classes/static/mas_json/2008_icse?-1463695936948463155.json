The framework uses UML models as the test inputs for the bounded exhaustive-testing approach. Within a size bound for the metamodel types, JULE enumerates only the set of non-isomorphic models in the form of relational structures. These models are classified into two sets - demonstration and counterexample - using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). The power of JULE lies in its model enumeration and its use of a high-performance grid infrastructure. Hence, JULE efficiently generates a very small test suite while increasing the bound on the input size to the extent that is practical for certification purpose.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Panuchart Bunyakiati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bunyakiati:Panuchart", "Anthony Finkelstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finkelstein:Anthony", "James Skene.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skene:James", "Clovis Chapman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chapman:Clovis"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
