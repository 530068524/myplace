{"title": "Detecting atomic-set serializability violations in multithreaded programs through active randomized testing.", "fields": ["isolation", "global serializability", "atomicity", "serializability", "commitment ordering"], "abstract": "Concurrency bugs are notoriously difficult to detect because there can be vast combinations of interleavings among concurrent threads, yet only a small fraction can reveal them.  Atomic-set serializability  characterizes a wide range of concurrency bugs, including data races and atomicity violations. In this paper, we propose a two-phase testing technique that can effectively detect atomic-set serializability violations. In Phase I, our technique infers potential violations that do not appear in a concrete execution and prunes those interleavings that are violation-free. In Phase II, our technique actively controls a thread scheduler to enumerate these potential scenarios identified in Phase I to look for real violations. We have implemented our technique as a prototype system AssetFuzzer and applied it to a number of subject programs for evaluating concurrency defect analysis techniques. The experimental results show that AssetFuzzer can identify more concurrency bugs than two recent testing tools RaceFuzzer and AtomFuzzer.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "City University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Zhifeng Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Zhifeng", "Shing-Chi Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Shing=Chi", "Wing Kwong Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Wing_Kwong"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
