The time complexity of our algorithm to find an approximate local minimum is even faster than that of gradient descent to find a critical point. Our algorithm applies to a general class of optimization problems including training a neural network and other non-convex objectives arising in machine learning.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "IAS, USA"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Naman Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Naman", "Zeyuan Allen Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Zeyuan_Allen", "Brian Bullins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bullins:Brian", "Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad", "Tengyu Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Tengyu"], "pages": 5}
