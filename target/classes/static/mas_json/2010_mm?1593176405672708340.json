We combined a user-centered design with three main components: information visualization techniques (based on semantic ordered treemaps), music information retrieval mechanisms (for semantic and content-based information extraction) and dynamic queries, to offer users a more efficient, flexible and yet, easy to use solution for browsing music collections and to create playlists. Preliminary results reveal that our solution is faster and easier to use than the Windows Media Player, allowing users to perform a more effective and fast navigation, while getting a deeper knowledge of their library. Satisfaction survey revealed that users liked our approach for browsing, filtering and creating playlists, while at the same time they were able to \"re-discover\" forgotten music, due to the similarity mechanisms incorporated in our solution.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Technical University of Lisbon", "Technical University of Lisbon"], "authors": ["Ricardo Dias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dias:Ricardo", "Manuel J.
