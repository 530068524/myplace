{"title": "Large-Scale QA-SRL Parsing.", "fields": ["recall", "predicate", "machine learning", "semantic role labeling", "parsing"], "abstract": "We present a new large-scale corpus of Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) annotations, and the first high-quality QA-SRL parser. Our corpus, QA-SRL Bank 2.0, consists of over 250,000 question-answer pairs for over 64,000 sentences across 3 domains and was gathered with a new crowd-sourcing scheme that we show has high precision and good recall at modest cost. We also present neural models for two QA-SRL subtasks: detecting argument spans for a predicate and generating questions to label the semantic relationship. The best models achieve question accuracy of 82.6% and span-level accuracy of 77.6% (under human evaluation) on the full pipelined QA-SRL prediction task. They can also, as we show, be used to gather additional annotations at low cost.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Luke Zettlemoyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zettlemoyer:Luke", "Nicholas FitzGerald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/FitzGerald:Nicholas", "Luheng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Luheng", "Julian Michael.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michael:Julian"], "pages": 10}
