{"title": "Unsupervised Deep Haar Scattering on Graphs.", "fields": ["haar", "absolute value", "haar wavelet", "blossom algorithm", "dimensionality reduction"], "abstract": "The classification of high-dimensional data defined on graphs is particularly difficult when the graph geometry is unknown. We introduce a Haar scattering transform on graphs, which computes invariant signal descriptors. It is implemented with a deep cascade of additions, subtractions and absolute values, which iteratively compute orthogonal Haar wavelet transforms. Multiscale neighborhoods of unknown graphs are estimated by minimizing an average total variation, with a pair matching algorithm of polynomial complexity. Supervised classification with dimension reduction is tested on data bases of scrambled images, and for signals sampled on unknown irregular grids on a sphere.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Xu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xu", "Xiuyuan Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiuyuan", "St\u00e9phane Mallat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mallat:St=eacute=phane"], "pages": 9}
