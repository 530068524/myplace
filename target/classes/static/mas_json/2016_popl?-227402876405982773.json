{"title": "Kleenex: compiling nondeterministic transducers to deterministic streaming transducers.", "fields": ["oracle", "oracle machine", "nondeterministic algorithm", "string", "use case"], "abstract": "We present and illustrate Kleenex, a language for expressing general nondeterministic finite transducers, and its novel compilation to streaming string transducers with essentially optimal streaming behavior, worst-case linear-time performance and sustained high throughput. Its underlying theory is based on transducer decomposition into oracle and action machines: the oracle machine performs streaming greedy disambiguation of the input; the action machine performs the output actions. In use cases Kleenex achieves consistently high throughput rates around the 1 Gbps range on stock hardware. It performs well, especially in complex use cases, in comparison to both specialized and related tools such as GNUawk, GNUsed, GNUgrep, RE2, Ragel and regular-expression libraries.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "Jobindex, Denmark", "Jobindex, Denmark"], "authors": ["Niels Bj\u00f8rn Bugge Grathwohl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grathwohl:Niels_Bj=oslash=rn_Bugge", "Fritz Henglein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henglein:Fritz", "Ulrik Terp Rasmussen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rasmussen:Ulrik_Terp", "Kristoffer Aalund S\u00f8holm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=oslash=holm:Kristoffer_Aalund", "Sebastian Paaske T\u00f8rholm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/T=oslash=rholm:Sebastian_Paaske"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
