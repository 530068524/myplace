{"title": "We Need Numbers!: Heuristic Evaluation during Demonstrations (HED) for Measuring Usability in IT System Procurement.", "fields": ["usability inspection", "usability lab", "cognitive walkthrough", "system usability scale", "usability goals"], "abstract": "We introduce a new usability inspection method called HED (heuristic evaluation during demonstrations) for measuring and comparing usability of competing complex IT systems in public procurement. The method presented enhances traditional heuristic evaluation to include the use context, comprehensive view of the system, and reveals missing functionality by using user scenarios and demonstrations. HED also quantifies the results in a comparable way. We present findings from a real-life validation of the method in a large-scale procurement project of a healthcare and social welfare information system. We analyze and compare the performance of HED to other usability evaluation methods used in procurement. Based on the analysis HED can be used to evaluate the level of usability of an IT system during procurement correctly, comprehensively and efficiently.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Aalto University", "University of Helsinki", "Aalto University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mari Tyllinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tyllinen:Mari", "Johanna Kaipio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaipio:Johanna", "Tinja L\u00e4\u00e4veri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=auml==auml=veri:Tinja", "Marko H.
