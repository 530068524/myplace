{"title": "Rate-Agnostic (Causal) Structure Learning.", "fields": ["extant taxon", "causal structure", "undersampling", "time series", "graph"], "abstract": "Causal structure learning from time series data is a major scientific challenge. Extant algorithms assume that measurements occur sufficiently quickly; more precisely, they assume approximately equal system and measurement timescales. In many domains, however, measurements occur at a significantly slower rate than the underlying system changes, but the size of the timescale mismatch is often unknown. This paper develops three causal structure learning algorithms, each of which discovers all dynamic causal graphs that explain the observed measurement data, perhaps given undersampling. That is, these algorithms all learn causal structure in a \"rate-agnostic\" manner: they do not assume any particular relation between the measurement and system timescales. We apply these algorithms to data from simulations to gain insight into the challenge of undersampling.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["The Mind Research Network", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of New Mexico", "University of New Mexico"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Sergey M.
