{"title": "GlossBoot: Bootstrapping Multilingual Domain Glossaries from the Web.", "fields": ["glossary", "gloss", "small number", "natural language processing", "bootstrapping"], "abstract": "We present GlossBoot, an effective minimally-supervised approach to acquiring wide-coverage domain glossaries for many languages. For each language of interest, given a small number of hypernymy relation seeds concerning a target domain, we bootstrap a glossary from the Web for that domain by means of iteratively acquired term/gloss extraction patterns. Our experiments show high performance in the acquisition of domain terminologies and glossaries for three different languages.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Flavio De Benedictis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benedictis:Flavio_De", "Stefano Faralli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faralli:Stefano", "Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto"], "pages": 11}
