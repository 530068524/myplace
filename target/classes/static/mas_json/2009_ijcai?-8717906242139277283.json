{"title": "Exchanging Reputation Information between Communities: A Payment-Function Approach.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "computer science", "reputation", "honesty", "payment"], "abstract": "We introduce a framework so that communities can exchange reputation information about agents in environments where agents are migrating between communities. We view the acquisition of the reputation information as a purchase and focus on the design of a payment function to facilitate the payment for information in a way that motivates communities to truthfully report reputation information for agents. We prove that in our proposed framework, honesty is the optimal policy and demonstrate the value of using a payment-function approach for the exchange of reputation information about agents between communities in multiagent environments. Using our payment function, each community is strengthened: it is able to reason more effectively about which agents to accept and can enjoy agents that are motivated to contribute strongly to the benefit of the community.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Georgia Kastidou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kastidou:Georgia", "Kate Larson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larson:Kate", "Robin Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Robin"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
