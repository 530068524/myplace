We introduce a new approach and use it to prove a \u03a9(log 1.5   n ) lower bound on the operational time of a wide range of boolean data structure problems, most notably, on the query time of dynamic range counting  over  F 2 . Proving an \u03c9(lg n ) lower bound for this problem was explicitly posed as one of five important open problems in the late Mihai P\u01cetrascu\u2019s obituary\u00a0. This result also implies the first \u03c9(lg n ) lower bound for the classical 2D range counting problem, one of the most fundamental data structure problems in computational geometry and spatial databases. We derive similar lower bounds for boolean versions of dynamic  polynomial evaluation  and  2D rectangle stabbing , and for the (non-boolean) problems of  range selection  and  range median .    Our technical centerpiece is a new way of \u201cweakly\u201d simulating dynamic data structures using efficient  one-way  communication protocols with small advantage over random guessing. This simulation involves a surprising excursion to low-degree (Chebyshev) polynomials which may be of independent interest, and offers an entirely new algorithmic angle on the \u201ccell sampling\u201d method of Panigrahy et al.\u00a0.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Columbia University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Kasper Green Larsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsen:Kasper_Green", "Omri Weinstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weinstein:Omri", "Huacheng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Huacheng"], "pages": 12}
