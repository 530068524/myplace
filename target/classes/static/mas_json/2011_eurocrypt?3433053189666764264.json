To date, constructions are only known either for weakened variants with separate \"honest\" and \"dishonest\" encryption algorithms, or for single-algorithm schemes with non-negligible detection probability.\n\nWe propose the first sender-deniable public key encryption system with a single encryption algorithm and negligible detection probability. We describe a generic interactive construction based on a public key bit encryption scheme that has certain properties, and we give two examples of encryption schemes with these properties, one based on the quadratic residuosity assumption and the other on trapdoor permutations.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Ruhr University Bochum", "Stanford University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Markus D\u00fcrmuth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=uuml=rmuth:Markus", "David Mandell Freeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freeman:David_Mandell"], "pages": 17}
