However, they have limited attention resources and face many challenges in keeping track of their charges. We present RubberBand, an assistive application that helps alleviate the teacher's burden. Our approach adapts to diverse field trip environmental and child behavioral dynamicity, utilizing observations of the relative dispersion of children and their tendency to form sub-groups.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Intel"], "authors": ["Hyukjae Jang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jang:Hyukjae", "Sungwon Peter Choe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choe:Sungwon_Peter", "Inseok Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Inseok", "Chanyou Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Chanyou", "Lama Nachman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nachman:Lama", "Junehwa Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Junehwa"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
