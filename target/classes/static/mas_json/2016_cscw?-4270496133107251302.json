{"title": "Botivist: Calling Volunteers to Action using Online Bots.", "fields": ["social media", "social issues", "corruption", "computer science", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "To help activists call new volunteers to action, we present Botivist: a platform that uses Twitter bots to find potential volunteers and request contributions. By leveraging different Twitter accounts, Botivist employs different strategies to encourage participation. We explore how people respond to bots calling them to action using a test case about corruption in Latin America. Our results show that the majority of volunteers (80\\%) who responded to Botivist's calls to action contributed relevant proposals to address the assigned social problem. Different strategies produced differences in the quantity and relevance of contributions. Some strategies that work well offline and face-to-face appeared to hinder people's participation when used by an online bot. We analyze user behavior in response to being approached by bots with an activist purpose. We also provide strong evidence for the value of this type of civic media, and derive design implications.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["National Autonomous University of Mexico", "Microsoft", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Saiph Savage.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savage:Saiph", "Andr\u00e9s Monroy-Hern\u00e1ndez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monroy=Hern=aacute=ndez:Andr=eacute=s", "Tobias H\u00f6llerer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=llerer:Tobias"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
