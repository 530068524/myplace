Tools for supporting document co-authoring are expected to satisfy two requirements: 1) querying changes over editing histories; 2) maintaining data consistency among users. Current tools support either limited queries or are not suitable for loosely controlled collaborative editing scenarios. We address both problems by proposing a new persistent data structure\u2014partial persistent sequence. The new data structure enables us to create unique character identifiers that can be used for associating meta-information and tracking their changes, and also design simple view synchronization algorithms to guarantee data consistency under the presence of concurrent updates. Experiments based on real-world collaborative editing traces show that our data structure uses disk space economically and provides efficient performance for document update and retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of S\u00e3o Paulo"], "authors": ["Qinyi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Qinyi", "Calton Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Calton", "Jo\u00e3o Eduardo Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Jo=atilde=o_Eduardo"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
