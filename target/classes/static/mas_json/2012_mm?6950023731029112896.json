Many cochlear implant recipients, especially pre-lingually deafened children, have difficulty recognizing and producing specific pitches. To improve musical auditory habilitation for children post cochlear implantation, we developed MOGAT: MObile Games with Auditory Training. The system includes three musical games built with off-the-shelf mobile devices to train their pitch perception and intonation skills respectively, and a cloud-based web service which allows music therapists to monitor and design individual training for children. The design of the games and web service was informed by a pilot survey (N=60 children). To ensure widespread use with low-cost mobile devices, we minimized the computation load while retaining highly accurate audio analysis. A 6-week user study (N=15 children) showed that the music habilitation with MOGAT was intuitive, enjoyable and motivating. It has improved most children's pitch discrimination and production, and several children's improvement was statistically significant ( p", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Singapore General Hospital", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yinsheng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yinsheng", "Khe Chai Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Khe_Chai", "Patsy Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Patsy", "Ye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ye"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
