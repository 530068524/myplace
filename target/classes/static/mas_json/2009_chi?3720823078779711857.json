{"title": "Evaluation of a tool-mounted guidance display for computer-assisted surgery.", "fields": ["computer monitor", "video camera", "liquid crystal display", "drill", "computer assisted surgery"], "abstract": "We attached a small LCD display and video camera to a surgical drill. The LCD shows the tool position with respect to a planned trajectory, overlaid on video captured by the camera. We performed a user study to determine whether such a tool-mounted guidance display yields faster and more accurate tool placement than the conventional guidance display on a separate computer monitor. Our study showed that the tool-mounted display provides better positional and angular accuracy than the conventional display but that the video camera provides no significant improvement in error.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Queen's University", "Queen's University"], "authors": ["Kevin Kassil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kassil:Kevin", "A.
