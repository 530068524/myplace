It is applied in medical research to link health data without revealing sensible person-related data. We propose and evaluate a new parallel PPRL approach based on Apache Flink that aims at high performance and scalability to large datasets. The approach supports a pivot-based filtering method for metric distance functions that saves many similarity computations. We describe our distributed approaches to determine pivots and pivot-based linkage. We also demonstrate the high efficiency of the approach for different datasets and configurations.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Leipzig University", "Leipzig University", "Australian National University", "Leipzig University"], "authors": ["Marcel Gladbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gladbach:Marcel", "Ziad Sehili.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sehili:Ziad", "Thomas Kudrass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kudrass:Thomas", "Peter Christen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Christen:Peter", "Erhard Rahm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahm:Erhard"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
