They are particularly challenging when the input data are images of a deforming body obtained by a single moving camera. We propose a new modelling framework, the multiview 3D warps. Existing models are twofold: they estimate inter-image warps which are often inconsistent between the different images and do not model the underlying 3D structure, or reconstruct just a sparse set of points. In contrast, our multiview 3D warps combine the advantages of both; they have an explicit 3D component and a set of 3D deformations combined with projection to 2D. They thus capture the dense deforming body's time-varying shape and camera pose. The advantages over the classical solutions are numerous: thanks to our feature-based estimation method for the multiview 3D warps, one can not only augment the original images but also retarget or clone the observed body's 3D deformations by changing the pose. Experimental results on simulated and real data are reported, confirming the advantages of our framework over existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "ALCoV - ISIT, U ... ermont 1, Italy"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Alessio Del Bue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bue:Alessio_Del", "Adrien Bartoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartoli:Adrien"], "pages": 8}
