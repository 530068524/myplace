A major difference between stance detection and traditional aspect-level sentiment classification is that the target of the stance might not be explicitly mentioned in text. In this paper, we show that the stance polarity of a text is not merely dependent on the content but is also highly determined by the concerned target. To this end, We propose a neural network based model, which incorporate target-specific information into stance classification using a novel attention mechanism. The proposed attention mechanism can focus on critical parts of a text. We evaluate our model on the SemEval 2016 Task 6 Twitter Stance Detection corpus achieving satisfactory performance. Our model achieves significant and consistent improvements on this task as compared with baselines.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Aston University", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jiachen Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Jiachen", "Ruifeng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ruifeng", "Yulan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yulan", "Lin Gui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gui_0003:Lin"], "pages": 7}
