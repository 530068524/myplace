This information can be applied to various urban applications such as advertising, traffic planning, and resource management. The recent researches have demonstrated on crowded estimation using various cutting-edge technologies to solve this problem. Since WiFi access points already exist in the major buildings and shops. They become a great tool to estimate the density of people. This research explores the opportunities to use existing access points in order to estimate density of people in the real world environment. WiFi probe request monitoring technique is used to identify the number of the customer's visit to a coffee shop. The result shows that during weekdays, the number of customers in promotion period is 30.43% greater than non-promotion period.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Thammasat University", "Thammasat University"], "authors": ["Pichaya Prasertsung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prasertsung:Pichaya", "Teerayut Horanont.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horanont:Teerayut"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
