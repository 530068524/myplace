It is unclear how the properties of these devices will affect individuals' privacy. In this study, we investigate the privacy perspectives of individuals when they are bystanders around AR devices. We conducted 12 field sessions in cafes and interviewed 31 bystanders regarding their reactions to a co-located AR device. Participants were predominantly split between having indifferent and negative reactions to the device. Participants who expressed that AR devices change the bystander experience attributed this difference to subtleness, ease of recording, and the technology's lack of prevalence. Additionally, participants surfaced a variety of factors that make recording more or less acceptable, including what they are doing when the recording is being taken. Participants expressed interest in being asked permission before being recorded and in recording-blocking devices. We use the interview results to guide an exploration of design directions for privacy-mediating technologies.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tamara Denning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denning:Tamara", "Zakariya Dehlawi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dehlawi:Zakariya", "Tadayoshi Kohno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohno:Tadayoshi"], "pages": 10}
