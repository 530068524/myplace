The Membership problem for a trace \\textit{w} and a Markov Decision Process \\textit{S} decides if there exists a strategy on \\textit{S} which generates with high probability traces close to \\textit{w}. We prove that Membership of a trace is \\emph{testable} and Equivalence of MDPs is polynomial time approximable. For Probabilistic Automata, Membership is not testable, and approximate Equivalence is undecidable. We give a class of properties, based on results concerning the structure of the tail sigma-field of a finite Markov chain, which characterizes equivalent Markov Decision Processes in this context.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Michel de Rougemont.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rougemont:Michel_de", "Mathieu Tracol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tracol:Mathieu"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
