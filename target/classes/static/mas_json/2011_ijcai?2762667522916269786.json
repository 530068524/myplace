{"title": "Generalized Planning: Synthesizing Plans that Work for Multiple Environments.", "fields": ["formalism", "finite set", "infinite set", "recursively enumerable language", "constructive"], "abstract": "We give a formal definition of generalized planning that is independent of any representation formalism. We assume that our generalized plans must work on a set of deterministic environments, which are essentially unrelated to each other. We prove that generalized planning for a finite set of environments is always decidable and EXPSPACE-complete. Our proof is constructive and gives us a sound, complete and complexity-wise optimal technique. We also consider infinite sets of environments, and show that generalized planning for the infinite \"one-dimensional problems,\" known in the literature to be recursively enumerable when restricted to finite-state plans, is EXPSPACE-decidable without sequence functions, and solvable by generalized planning for finite sets.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Dipartimento di ... a, Roma, Italy"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yuxiao Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yuxiao", "Giuseppe De Giacomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giacomo:Giuseppe_De"], "pages": 6}
