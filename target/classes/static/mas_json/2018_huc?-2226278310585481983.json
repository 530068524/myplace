{"title": "1D eyewear: peripheral, hidden LEDs and near-eye holographic displays for unobtrusive augmentation.", "fields": ["holographic display", "peripheral", "diffraction grating", "eyewear", "wearable computer"], "abstract": "1D Eyewear uses 1D arrays of LEDs and pre-recorded holographic symbols to enable minimal head-worn displays. Our approach uses computer-generated holograms (CGHs) to create diffraction gratings which project a pre-recorded static image when illuminated with coherent light. Specifically, we develop a set of transmissive, reflective, and steerable optical configurations that can be embedded in conventional eyewear designs. This approach enables high resolution symbolic display in discreet digital eyewear.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Alex Olwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olwal:Alex", "Bernard Kress.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kress:Bernard"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
