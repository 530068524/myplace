The key technical features of our approach are (1) a method to mine non-gesture patterns that deals with the arbitrary data (Null Class), and (2) an optimisation based on multipopulation genetic programming to approximate spotting network's parameters across target and non-target models. We evaluate our GMM-HMMs spotting network in a novel free living dataset, including totally 35 days of annotated inertial sensor's recordings from seven participants. Drinking was chosen as target gesture. Our method reached an average F1-score of over 74% and clearly outperformed an HMM-based threshold model approach. The results suggest that our spotting network approach is viable for sparse natural pattern spotting.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"], "authors": ["Giovanni Schiboni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiboni:Giovanni", "Oliver Amft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amft:Oliver"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
