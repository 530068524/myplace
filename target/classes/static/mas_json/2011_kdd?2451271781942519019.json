We focus on user reputation in a comment rating environment, where users make comments about content items and rate the comments of one another. Intuitively, a reputable user posts high quality comments and is highly rated by the user community. To our surprise, we find that the quality of a comment judged editorially is almost uncorrelated with the ratings that it receives, but can be predicted using standard text features, achieving accuracy as high as the agreement between two editors! However, extracting a pure reputation signal from ratings is difficult because of data sparseness and several confounding factors in users' voting behavior. To address these issues, we propose a novel bias-smoothed tensor model and empirically show that our model significantly outperforms a number of alternatives based on Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Buzz and Epinions datasets.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Harvard University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Bee-Chung Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bee=Chung", "Jian Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo_0002:Jian", "Belle L.
