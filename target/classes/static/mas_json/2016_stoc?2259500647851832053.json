In 2010 Klartag and Regev demonstrated such a function and asked, whether there existed a function with an efficient quantum simultaneous-messages protocol, but still no efficient classical two-way protocol. In this work we answer the latter question affirmatively and present a partial function Shape, which can be computed by a protocol sending entangled simultaneous messages of poly-logarithmic size, and whose classical two-way complexity is lower bounded by a polynomial.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Czech Academy o ... iences, Czechia"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Dmitry Gavinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavinsky:Dmitry"], "pages": 8}
