We show that unlike \"normal\" PRFs, wPRFs are seed-incompressible, in the sense that the output of a wPRF is pseudorandom even if a bounded amount of information about the key is leaked.\n\nAs an application of this result we construct a simple mode of operation which --- when instantiated with any wPRF --- gives a  leakage-resilient  stream-cipher. The implementation of such a cipher is secure against  every  side-channel attack, as long as the amount of information leaked  per round  is bounded, but overall can be arbitrary large. The construction is simpler than the previous one (Dziembowski-Pietrzak FOCS'08) as it only uses a single primitive (a wPRF) in a straight forward manner.", "citation": "Citations (252)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["CWI Amsterdam,  ... he Netherlands"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Krzysztof Pietrzak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietrzak:Krzysztof"], "pages": 21}
