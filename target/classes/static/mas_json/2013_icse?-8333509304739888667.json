{"title": "It's not a bug, it's a feature: how misclassification impacts bug prediction.", "fields": ["software maintenance", "predictive modelling", "computer science", "mining software repositories", "software bug", "code refactoring"], "abstract": "In a manual examination of more than 7,000 issue reports from the bug databases of five open-source projects, we found 33.8% of all bug reports to be misclassified - that is, rather than referring to a code fix, they resulted in a new feature, an update to documentation, or an internal refactoring. This misclassification introduces bias in bug prediction models, confusing bugs and features: On average, 39% of files marked as defective actually never had a bug. We discuss the impact of this misclassification on earlier studies and recommend manual data validation for future studies.", "citation": "Citations (211)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "authors": ["Kim Herzig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herzig:Kim", "Sascha Just.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Just:Sascha", "Andreas Zeller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeller:Andreas"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
