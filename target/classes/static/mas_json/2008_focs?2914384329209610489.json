We obtain the first exponential lower bound on the sign-rank of a function in AC 0 . Namely, let f(x, y) = Lambda i=1   m  Lambda j=1   m   2 (x ij  Lambda y ij ). We show that the matrix [f(x, y)] x,   y  has sign-rank 2 Omega(m) . This in particular implies that Sigma 2   cc nsubeUPP cc , which solves a long-standing open problem posed by Babai, Frankl, and Simon (1986). Our result additionally implies a lower bound in learning theory. Specifically, let Phi 1 ,..., Phi r  : {0, 1} n  rarrRopf be functions such that every DNF formula f : {0, 1} n  rarr {-1, +1} of polynomial size has the representation f equiv sign(a 1 Phi 1  + hellip + a r Phi r ) for some reals a 1 ,..., a r . We prove that then r ges 2 Omega(n   1/3   ) , which essentially matches an upper bound of 2 Otilde(n   1/3   )  due to Klivans and Servedio (2001). Finally, our work yields the first exponential lower bound on the size of threshold-of-majority circuits computing a function in AC 0 . This substantially generalizes and strengthens the results of Krause and Pudlak (1997).", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Institute for Advanced Study", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Alexander A.
