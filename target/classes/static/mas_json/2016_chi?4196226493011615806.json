The goal of this work is to explore how to design non-touchscreen gestures to extend the input space of smartwatches. We conducted an elicitation study eliciting gestures for 31 smartwatch tasks. From this study, we demonstrate that a consensus exists among the participants on the mapping of gesture to command and use this consensus to specify a user-defined gesture set. Using gestures collected during our study, we define a taxonomy describing the mapping and physical characteristics of the gestures. Lastly, we provide insights to inform the design of non-touchscreen gestures for smartwatch interaction.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Colorado State University", "Colorado State University", "Colorado State University", "Colorado State University", "Colorado State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Shaikh Shawon Arefin Shimon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimon:Shaikh_Shawon_Arefin", "Courtney Lutton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutton:Courtney", "Zichun Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zichun", "Sarah Morrison-Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morrison=Smith:Sarah", "Christina Boucher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boucher:Christina", "Jaime Ruiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruiz:Jaime"], "pages": 12}
