In this paper, we show that computational proofs of indistinguishability can be considerably simplified, for a class of processes that covers most existing protocols. More precisely, we show a soundness theorem, following the line of research launched by Abadi and Rogaway in 2000: computational indistinguishability in presence of an active attacker is implied by the observational equivalence of the corresponding symbolic processes. We prove our result for symmetric encryption, but the same techniques can be applied to other security primitives such as signatures and public-key encryption. The proof requires the introduction of new concepts, which are general and can be reused in other settings.", "citation": "Citations (112)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Hubert Comon-Lundh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Comon=Lundh:Hubert", "V\u00e9ronique Cortier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cortier:V=eacute=ronique"], "pages": 10}
