When worn on a wrist, however, watches are often visible to many other people, making it easy to quickly glance at their displays. We explore the possibility of extending smartwatch interactions to turn personal wearables into more public displays. We begin opening up this area by investigating fundamental aspects of this interaction form, such as the social acceptability and noticeability of looking at someone else's watch, as well as the likelihood of a watch face being visible to others. We then sketch out interaction dimensions as a design space, evaluating each aspect via a web-based study and a deployment of three potential designs. We conclude with a discussion of the findings, implications of the approach and ways in which designers in this space can approach public wrist-worn wearables.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Swansea University", "Swansea University", "Swansea University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jennifer Pearson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pearson_0001:Jennifer", "Simon Robinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robinson:Simon", "Matt Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones_0001:Matt"], "pages": 10}
