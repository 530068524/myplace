{"title": "Lucid Virtual Dreaming: Antecedents and Consequents of Virtual Lucidity During Virtual Threat.", "fields": ["social psychology", "lucid dream", "meditation", "virtual reality", "simulation"], "abstract": "Here we report the first empirical findings on virtual lucidity (VL), a new construct similar to lucidity during dreaming, but regarding awareness that one is having a virtual experience. VL concerns the depth and breadth of this awareness, as well as the extent it affords regulatory monitoring and control. To study VL, we adapted a measure from lucid dreaming research to assess whether more VL predicted lower fear, but not less enjoyment, during a virtual reality (VR) threat scenario of walking, and being asked to step off, a wooden plank seemingly high above a city. We examined predictors of VL and related outcomes across a community sample and lucid dream trainees at a meditation retreat center. In line with hypotheses, higher VL predicted less fear, more enjoyment, and greater likelihood of stepping off the plank. Moreover, a number of dispositional factors predicted greater VL and lower fear. Lucid dream retreatants, engaged in a contemplative practice called illusory form yoga, experienced more VL and less fear compared to nonretreatants, with marginally higher likelihood of stepping off the plank. Finally, VL mediated all significant relations between predictors and outcomes. Results held controlling for presence or fear of heights. We discuss the potential validity and utility of VL, its relation to presence, and examples of how it may inform the development and application of VR and related technologies.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Naropa University", "Nalandabodhi"], "authors": ["Jordan T.
