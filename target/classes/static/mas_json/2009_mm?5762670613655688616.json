We propose to form a cooperative network among mobile devices that receive the same video stream, and share received video data over a WLAN. We analytically show that the proposed system outperforms current systems in terms of energy consumption and channel switching delay. Our trace-based simulation results show that the proposed system: (i) achieves as high as 70% of energy saving gain, (ii) outperforms current systems with only two cooperative mobile devices, (iii) reduce channel switching delay by up to 98%, (iv) is robust under device failure and quickly reacts to network dynamics, and (v) uniformly distributes the load on all cooperative devices.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Yi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yi", "Cheng-Hsin Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Cheng=Hsin", "Mohamed Hefeeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hefeeda:Mohamed"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
