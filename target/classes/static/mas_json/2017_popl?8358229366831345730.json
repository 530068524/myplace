Together with their closely related counterparts,  Hoare monads , they provide the basis on which verification tools like F*, Hoare Type Theory (HTT), and Ynot are built. We show that Dijkstra monads can be derived \u00e2  for free\u00e2   by applying a continuation-passing style (CPS) translation to the standard monadic definitions of the underlying computational effects. Automatically deriving Dijkstra monads in this way provides a correct-by-construction and efficient way of reasoning about user-defined effects in dependent type theories. We demonstrate these ideas in EMF*, a new dependently typed calculus, validating it via both formal proof and a prototype implementation within F*. Besides equipping F* with a more uniform and extensible effect system, EMF* enables a novel mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic proofs within F*.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Danel Ahman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahman:Danel", "Catalin Hritcu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hritcu:Catalin", "Kenji Maillard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maillard:Kenji", "Guido Martinez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martinez:Guido", "Gordon D.
