{"title": "Canonical Correlation Inference for Mapping Abstract Scenes to Text.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "machine learning", "inference", "structured prediction", "canonical correlation"], "abstract": "We describe a technique for structured prediction, based on canonical correlation analysis. Our learning algorithm finds two projections for the input and the output spaces that aim at projecting a given input and its correct output into points close to each other. We demonstrate our technique on a language-vision problem, namely the problem of giving a textual description to an \"abstract scene\".", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "School of Infor ... and Computation"], "authors": ["Nikos Papasarantopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papasarantopoulos:Nikos", "Helen Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Helen", "Shay B.
