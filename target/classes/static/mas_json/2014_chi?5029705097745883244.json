{"title": "Pixel-based methods for widget state and style in a runtime implementation of sliding widgets.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "computer science", "pixel", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Pixel-based methods offer unique potential for modifying existing interfaces independent of their underlying implementation. Prior work has demonstrated a variety of modifications to existing interfaces, including accessibility enhancements, interface language translation, testing frameworks, and interaction techniques. But pixel-based methods have also been limited in their understanding of the interface and therefore the complexity of modifications they can support. This work examines deeper pixel-level understanding of widgets and the resulting capabilities of pixel-based runtime enhancements. Specifically, we present three new sets of methods: methods for pixel-based modeling of widgets in multiple states, methods for managing the combinatorial complexity that arises in creating a multitude of runtime enhancements, and methods for styling runtime enhancements to preserve consistency with the design of an existing interface. We validate our methods through an implementation of Moscovich et al.'s Sliding Widgets, a novel runtime enhancement that could not have been implemented with prior pixel-based methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Morgan E.
