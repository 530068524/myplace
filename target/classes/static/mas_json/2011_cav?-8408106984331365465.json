A relational abstraction is obtained by replacing the continuous dynamics in each mode by a binary transition relation that relates a state of the system to any state that can potentially be reached at some future time instant using the continuous dynamics. We construct relational abstractions by reusing template-based invariant generation techniques for continuous systems described by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). As a result, we abstract a given hybrid system as a purely discrete, infinite-state system. We apply k-induction to this abstraction to prove safety properties, and use bounded model-checking to find potential falsifications. We present the basic underpinnings of our approach and demonstrate its use on many benchmark systems to derive simple and usable abstractions.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "SRI International"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Sriram Sankaranarayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankaranarayanan:Sriram", "Ashish Tiwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwari:Ashish"], "pages": 17}
