However, current CDCF methods that mainly consider user and item factors but largely neglect the heterogeneity of domains may lead to improper knowledge transfer issues. To address this problem, we propose a novel CDCF model, the Bilinear Multilevel Analysis (BLMA), which seamlessly introduces multilevel analysis theory to the most successful collaborative filtering method, matrix factorization (MF). Specifically, we employ BLMA to more efficiently address the determinants of ratings from a hierarchical view by jointly considering domain, community, and user effects so as to overcome the issues caused by traditional MF approaches. Moreover, a parallel Gibbs sampler is provided to learn these effects. Finally, experiments conducted on a realworld dataset demonstrate the superiority of the BLMA over other state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Stanford University", "Dept of EE, STIEI"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Liang Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Liang", "Jian Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Jian", "Guandong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Guandong", "Jie Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jie", "Zhiping Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Zhiping", "Longbing Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Longbing"], "pages": 7}
