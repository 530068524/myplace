D-CRSat significantly improves on CRSat on real-world application benchmarks on which other current CNF and circuit-level SLS methods tend to perform weakly. We also give an intricate proof of probabilistically approximate completeness for D-CRSat, highlighting key features of the method.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University College Dublin", "University of Helsinki", "York University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Anton Belov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belov:Anton", "Matti J\u00e4rvisalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=auml=rvisalo:Matti", "Zbigniew Stachniak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stachniak:Zbigniew"], "pages": 6}
