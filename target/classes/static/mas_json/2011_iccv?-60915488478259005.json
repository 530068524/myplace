Our experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method produces remarkably good results and outperforms all baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Sharjah", "University of Central Florida"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Chuan Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Chuan", "Imran N.
