Our motivational study with 53 professional developers shows they face huge challenges in meeting power requirements. The key challenges are from the significant time and effort for repetitive power measurements since the power use of sensing applications needs to be evaluated under various real-world usage scenarios and sensing parameters. PADA enables developers to obtain  enriched  power information under diverse  usage scenarios  in  development environments  without deploying and testing applications on real phones in real-life situations. We conducted two user studies with 19 developers to evaluate the usability of PADA. We show that developers benefit from using PADA in the implementation and power tuning of mobile sensing applications.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Singapore Management University", "School of Compu ... ring, KOREATECH"], "authors": ["Chulhong Min.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Min:Chulhong", "Seungchul Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Seungchul", "Changhun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Changhun", "Youngki Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Youngki", "Seungwoo Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Seungwoo", "Seungpyo Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Seungpyo", "Wonjung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Wonjung", "Junehwa Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Junehwa"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
