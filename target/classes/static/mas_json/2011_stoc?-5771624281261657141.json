Vertex Multicut is the analogous problem where S is a set of at most p vertices. Our main result is that both problems can be solved in time 2 O(p 3 )  \u22c5 n O(1) , i.e., fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the size p of the cutset in the solution. By contrast, it is unlikely that an algorithm with running time of the form f(p) \u22c5 n O(1)  exists for the directed version of the problem, as we show it to be W[1]-hard parameterized by the size of the cutset.", "citation": "Citations (130)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Humboldt University of Berlin", "University of Leicester"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["D\u00e1niel Marx.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marx:D=aacute=niel", "Igor Razgon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Razgon:Igor"], "pages": 10}
