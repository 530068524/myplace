{"title": "Exploiting graphics processors for high-performance IP lookup in software routers.", "fields": ["loose source routing", "coprocessor", "ipodwdm", "instruction set", "routing table"], "abstract": "As the physical link speeds grow and the size of routing table continues to increase, IP address lookup has been a challenging problem at routers. There have been growing demands in achieving high-performance IP lookup cost-effectively. Existing approaches typically resort to specialized hardwares, such as TCAM. While these approaches can take advantage of hardware parallelism to achieve high-performance IP lookup, they also have the disadvantage of high cost. This paper investigates a new way to build a cost-effective IP lookup scheme using graphics processor units (GPU). Our contribution here is to design a practical architecture for high-performance IP lookup engine with GPU, and to develop efficient algorithms for routing prefix update operations such as deletion, insertion, and modification. Leveraging GPU's many-core parallelism, the proposed schemes addressed the challenges in designing IP lookup at GPU-based software routers. Our experimental results on real-world route traces show promising gains in IP lookup and update operations.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Tsinghua University", "University of G\u00f6ttingen"], "authors": ["Jin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Jin", "Xinya Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xinya", "Xin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Xin", "Yangdong Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Yangdong", "Xiaoming Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu_0001:Xiaoming"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
