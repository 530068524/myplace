Choosing an appropriate distance metric for matching determines its accuracy and robustness, and significantly influences the tracking performance. This paper presents a new tracking approach that incorporates adaptive metric into differential tracking method. This new approach automatically learns an optimal distance metric for more accurate matching, and obtains a closed-form analytical solution to motion estimation and differential tracking. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of adaptive metric, and demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed new tracking method.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Northwestern University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Nan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Nan", "Wenyu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wenyu", "Ying Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ying"], "pages": 8}
