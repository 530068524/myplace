{"title": "Coordination Structures in Dependency Treebanks.", "fields": ["natural language", "natural language processing", "syntax", "empirical evidence", "parsing"], "abstract": "Paratactic syntactic structures are notoriously difficult to represent in dependency formalisms. This has painful consequences such as high frequency of parsing errors related to coordination. In other words, coordination is a pending problem in dependency analysis of natural languages. This paper tries to shed some light on this area by bringing a systematizing view of various formal means developed for encoding coordination structures. We introduce a novel taxonomy of such approaches and apply it to treebanks across a typologically diverse range of 26 languages. In addition, empirical observations on convertibility between selected styles of representations are shown too.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Charles University in Prague", "Charles University in Prague", "Charles University in Prague", "Charles University in Prague", "Charles University in Prague"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Martin Popel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popel:Martin", "David Marecek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marecek:David", "Jan Step\u00e1nek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Step=aacute=nek:Jan", "Daniel Zeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeman:Daniel", "Zdenek Zabokrtsk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zabokrtsk=yacute=:Zdenek"], "pages": 11}
