We complement these guarantees by demonstrating almost matching hardness lower bounds, which show that our performance bound is nearly optimal. Our result yields new insight into margin-based nearest neighbor classification in metric spaces and allows us to significantly sharpen and simplify existing bounds. Some encouraging empirical results are also presented.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Ariel University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Tel Aviv University", "Ariel University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ariel University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Lee-Ad Gottlieb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottlieb:Lee=Ad", "Aryeh Kontorovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontorovich:Aryeh", "Pinhas Nisnevitch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nisnevitch:Pinhas"], "pages": 9}
