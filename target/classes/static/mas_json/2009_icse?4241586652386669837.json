Although software debugging, especially fault-localization, has been studied for long, few practical debugging tools have been developed and used by the industry. In this paper we present VIDA, a visual interactive debugging tool, which has been integrated with the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment to support a programmer's debugging process. During the programmer's conventional debugging process, VIDA continuously recommends break-points for the programmer based on the analysis of execution information and the gathered feedback from the programmer. Moreover, VIDA provides a program outline to help the programmer choose breakpoints and visualizes the static dependency relation to help the programmer make estimation at breakpoints.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Dan Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Dan", "Lingming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lingming", "Lu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0023:Lu", "Jiasu Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jiasu", "Hong Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Hong"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
