{"title": "The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding.", "fields": ["deep learning", "machine learning", "object detection", "annotation", "empirical research"], "abstract": "Visual understanding of complex urban street scenes is an enabling factor for a wide range of applications. Object detection has benefited enormously from large-scale datasets, especially in the context of deep learning. For semantic urban scene understanding, however, no current dataset adequately captures the complexity of real-world urban scenes. To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations, 20 000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (820)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Marius Cordts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cordts:Marius", "Mohamed Omran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Omran:Mohamed", "Sebastian Ramos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramos:Sebastian", "Timo Rehfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rehfeld:Timo", "Markus Enzweiler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Enzweiler:Markus", "Rodrigo Benenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benenson:Rodrigo", "Uwe Franke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Franke:Uwe", "Stefan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth_0001:Stefan", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "pages": 11}
