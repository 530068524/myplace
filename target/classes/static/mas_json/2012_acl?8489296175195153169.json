A number of sentiment word/sense dictionaries have been manually or (semi)automatically constructed. The dictionaries have substantial inaccuracies. Besides obvious instances, where the same word appears with different polarities in different dictionaries, the dictionaries exhibit complex cases, which cannot be detected by mere manual inspection. We introduce the concept of polarity consistency of words/senses in sentiment dictionaries in this paper. We show that the consistency problem is NP-complete. We reduce the polarity consistency problem to the satisfiability problem and utilize a fast SAT solver to detect inconsistencies in a sentiment dictionary. We perform experiments on four sentiment dictionaries and WordNet.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Purdue University", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "Binghamton University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Eduard C.
