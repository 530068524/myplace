{"title": "An Axiomatic Theory of Fairness in Network Resource Allocation.", "fields": ["resource allocation", "axiomatic system", "axiom", "resource management", "fairness measure"], "abstract": "We present five axioms for fairness measures in resource allocation. A family of fairness measures satisfying the axioms is constructed. Special cases of this family include \u03b1-fairness, Jain's index, and entropy. Properties of fairness measures satisfying the axioms are proven, including Schur-concavity. Among the engineering implications is a generalized Jain's index that tunes the resolution of fairness measure, a new understanding of \u03b1-fair utility functions, and an interpretation of ``larger \u03b1 is more fair''. We also construct an alternative set of axioms to capture system efficiency and feasibility constraints.", "citation": "Citations (253)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Rice University", "Princeton University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Tian Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Tian", "David T.
