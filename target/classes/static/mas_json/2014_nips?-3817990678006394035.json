These phenomena include the similarity effect, the attraction effect, and the compromise effect. We formally quantify the strength of these phenomena that can be represented by our choice model, which illuminates the flexibility of our choice model. We then show that our choice model can be represented as a restricted Boltzmann machine and that its parameters can be learned effectively from data. Our numerical experiments with real data of human choices suggest that we can train our choice model in such a way that it represents the typical phenomena of choice.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Takayuki Osogami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osogami:Takayuki", "Makoto Otsuka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Otsuka:Makoto"], "pages": 9}
