Empirically, compiling CNFs into SDDs has yielded significant improvements in both time and space over compiling them into OBDDs, using a bottom-up compilation approach. In this work, we present a top-down CNF to SDD compiler that is based on techniques from the SAT literature. We compare the presented compiler empirically to the state-of-the-art, bottom-up SDD compiler, showing orders-of-magnitude improvements in compilation time.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Umut Oztok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oztok:Umut", "Adnan Darwiche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darwiche:Adnan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
