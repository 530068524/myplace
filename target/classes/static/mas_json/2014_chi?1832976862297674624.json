Recent years have brought a rash of high-profile account compromises, but account hijacking is not limited to high-profile accounts. In this paper, we report results of a survey about people's experiences with and attitudes toward account hijacking. The problem is widespread; 30% of our 294 participants had an email or social networking account accessed by an unauthorized party. Five themes emerged from our results: (1) compromised accounts are often valuable to victims, (2) attackers are mostly unknown, but sometimes known, to victims, (3) users acknowledge some responsibility for keeping their accounts secure, (4) users' understanding of important security measures is incomplete, and (5) harm from account hijacking is concrete and emotional. We discuss implications for designing security mechanisms to improve chances for user adoption.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Google", "Google", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Richard Shay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shay:Richard", "Iulia Ion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ion:Iulia", "Robert W.
