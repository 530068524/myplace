{"title": "Cross-dataset action detection.", "fields": ["clips", "maximum likelihood", "machine learning", "computer vision", "effective action"], "abstract": "In recent years, many research works have been carried out to recognize human actions from video clips. To learn an effective action classifier, most of the previous approaches rely on enough training labels. When being required to recognize the action in a different dataset, these approaches have to re-train the model using new labels. However, labeling video sequences is a very tedious and time-consuming task, especially when detailed spatial locations and time durations are required. In this paper, we propose an adaptive action detection approach which reduces the requirement of training labels and is able to handle the task of cross-dataset action detection with few or no extra training labels. Our approach combines model adaptation and action detection into a Maximum a Posterior (MAP) estimation framework, which explores the spatial-temporal coherence of actions and makes good use of the prior information which can be obtained without supervision. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on KTH action dataset using only 50% of the training labels in tradition approaches. Furthermore, we show that our approach is effective for the cross-dataset detection which adapts the model trained on KTH to two other challenging datasets 1 .", "citation": "Citations (177)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Microsoft", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Liangliang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Liangliang", "Zicheng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zicheng", "Thomas S.
