We present Bach, a technique for discovering likely  relational specifications  from data describing input\u00e2  output behavior of a set of functions comprising a library or a program. Relational specifications correlate different executions of different functions; for instance, commutativity, transitivity, equivalence of two functions, etc. Bach combines novel insights from program synthesis and databases to discover a rich array of specifications. We apply Bach to learn specifications from data generated for a number of standard libraries. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates Bach\u00e2  s ability to learn useful and deep specifications in a small amount of time.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Calvin Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith:Calvin", "Gabriel Ferns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferns:Gabriel", "Aws Albarghouthi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albarghouthi:Aws"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
