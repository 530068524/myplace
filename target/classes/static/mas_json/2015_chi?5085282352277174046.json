{"title": "EyeBookmark: Assisting Recovery from Interruption during Reading.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "gaze", "eye tracking", "bookmarking", "multimedia"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present gaze-based bookmarking, EyeBookmark, to mitigate the deleterious effect of interruption during reading. The key idea of EyeBookmark is to provide a visual cue to help people decide where to resume reading. We design four highlighting methods and conduct a controlled user study with a proof-of-concept design to verify the usefulness of EyeBookmark. The user study demonstrates not only that participants preferred our highlighting methods but also that such highlighting methods significantly reduced the time taken to resume reading after interruption regardless of the difficulty of text.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University Bundang Hospital", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jaemin Jo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jo:Jaemin", "Bo Hyoung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Bo_Hyoung", "Jinwook Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Jinwook"], "pages": 4}
