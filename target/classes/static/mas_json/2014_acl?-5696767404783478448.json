{"title": "Shift-Reduce CCG Parsing with a Dependency Model.", "fields": ["oracle", "machine learning", "parsing", "ambiguity", "spurious relationship"], "abstract": "This paper presents the first dependency model for a shift-reduce CCG parser. Modelling dependencies is desirable for a number of reasons, including handling the \u201cspurious\u201d ambiguity of CCG; fitting well with the theory of CCG; and optimizing for structures which are evaluated at test time. We develop a novel training technique using a dependency oracle, in which all derivations are hidden. A challenge arises from the fact that the oracle needs to keep track of exponentially many goldstandard derivations, which is solved by integrating a packed parse forest with the beam-search decoder. Standard CCGBank tests show the model achieves up to 1.05 labeled F-score improvements over three existing, competitive CCG parsing models.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "Singapore University of Technology and Design"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Wenduan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Wenduan", "Stephen Clark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clark:Stephen", "Yue Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Yue"], "pages": 10}
