Traditional methods on single-attribute data have pruning power only on single attributes and cannot efficiently support multi-attribute data. To address this problem, we propose a prefix tree index which has holis- tic pruning ability on multiple attributes. We propose a cost model to quantify the prefix tree which can guide the prefix tree construction. Based on the prefix tree, we devise a filter-verification framework to support similarity search and join on multi-attribute data. The filter step prunes a large number of dissimilar results and identifies some candi- dates using the prefix tree and the verification step verifies the candidates to generate the final answer. For similar- ity join, we prove that constructing an optimal prefix tree is NP-complete and develop a greedy algorithm to achieve high performance. For similarity search, since one prefix tree cannot support all possible search queries, we extend the cost model to support similarity search and devise a budget-based algorithm to construct multiple high-quality prefix trees. We also devise a hybrid verification algorithm to improve the verification step. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Guoliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Guoliang", "Jian He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Jian", "Dong Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Dong", "Jian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jian"], "pages": 15}
