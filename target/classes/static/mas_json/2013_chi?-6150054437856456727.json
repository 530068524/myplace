{"title": "Augmented letters: mnemonic gesture-based shortcuts.", "fields": ["mnemonic", "handwriting", "dreyfus model of skill acquisition", "gesture", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "We propose Augmented Letters, a new technique aimed at augmenting gesture-based techniques such as Marking Menus [9] by giving them natural, mnemonic associations. Augmented Letters gestures consist of the initial of command names, sketched by hand in the Unistroke style, and affixed with a straight tail. We designed a tentative touch device interaction technique that supports fast interactions with large sets of commands, is easily discoverable, improves user's recall at no speed cost, and supports fluid transition from novice to expert mode. An experiment suggests that Augmented Letters outperform Marking Menu in terms of user recall.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "University of Canterbury", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Quentin Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Quentin", "Sylvain Malacria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malacria:Sylvain", "Yves Guiard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guiard:Yves", "Eric Lecolinet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lecolinet:Eric", "James Eagan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eagan:James"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
