{"title": "ParTime: Parallel Temporal Aggregation.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "parallel database", "workload", "temporal database", "data parallelism"], "abstract": "This paper presents ParTime, a parallel algorithm for temporal aggregation. Temporal aggregation is one of the most important, yet most complex temporal query operators. It has been extensively studied in the past, but so far there has only been one attempt to parallelize this operator. ParTime supports data parallelism and has a number of additional advantages: It supports the full bitemporal data model, it requires no a-priori indexing, it supports shared computation, and it runs well on modern hardware (i.e., NUMA machines with large main memories). We implemented ParTime in a parallel database system and carried out comprehensive performance experiments with a real workload from the airline industry and a synthetic benchmark, the TPC-BiH benchmark. The results show that ParTime significantly outperforms any other available temporal database system. Furthermore, the results show that ParTime is competitive as compared to the Timeline Index, the best known technique to process temporal queries from the research literature and which is based on pre-computation and indexing.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Microsoft", "Amadeus Group,  ... tipolis, France"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Markus Pilman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilman:Markus", "Martin Kaufmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufmann:Martin", "Florian K\u00f6hl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=hl:Florian", "Donald Kossmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kossmann:Donald", "Damien Profeta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Profeta:Damien"], "pages": 12}
