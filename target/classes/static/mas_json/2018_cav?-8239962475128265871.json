{"title": "Value Iteration for Simple Stochastic Games: Stopping Criterion and Learning Algorithm.", "fields": ["graph", "limit of a sequence", "asynchronous communication", "anytime algorithm", "markov decision process"], "abstract": "Simple stochastic games can be solved by value iteration (VI), which yields a sequence of under-approximations of the value of the game. This sequence is guaranteed to converge to the value only in the limit. Since no stopping criterion is known, this technique does not provide any guarantees on its results. We provide the first stopping criterion for VI on simple stochastic games. It is achieved by additionally computing a convergent sequence of over-approximations of the value, relying on an analysis of the game graph. Consequently, VI becomes an anytime algorithm returning the approximation of the value and the current error bound. As another consequence, we can provide a simulation-based asynchronous VI algorithm, which yields the same guarantees, but without necessarily exploring the whole game graph.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Edon Kelmendi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelmendi:Edon", "Julia Kr\u00e4mer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=auml=mer:Julia", "Jan Kret\u00ednsk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kret=iacute=nsk=yacute=:Jan", "Maximilian Weininger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weininger:Maximilian"], "pages": 20}
