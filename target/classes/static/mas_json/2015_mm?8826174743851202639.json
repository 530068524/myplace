These demanding applications introduce challenges in different phases throughout the delivery chain of 3DTI systems. To tackle them, we propose to exploit contextual information of 3DTI systems, such as contextual information on resource, content, and satisfaction aspects. Understanding contextual information will improve the utilization of different computing environments to fulfill the objectives of targeted application.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Shannon Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shannon"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
