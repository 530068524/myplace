Usually, the performance of exploration strategies used to decide where to go next is not compared against the optimal performance obtainable in the test environments, because the latter is generally unknown. In this paper, we present a method to calculate an approximation of the optimal (shortest) exploration path in an arbitrary environment. We consider a mobile robot with limited visibility, discretize a two-dimensional environment with a regular grid, and formulate a search problem for finding the optimal exploration path in the grid, which is solved using A*. Experimental results show the viability of our approach for realistically large environments and its potential for better assessing the performance of on-line exploration strategies.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "University of California, Merced"], "authors": ["Alberto Quattrini Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Alberto_Quattrini", "Francesco Amigoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amigoni:Francesco", "Nicola Basilico.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basilico:Nicola"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
