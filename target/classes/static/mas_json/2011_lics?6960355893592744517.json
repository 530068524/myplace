From a practical perspective, higher-order model checking provides a foundation for software model checkers for functional programming languages such as ML and Haskell. This short article aims to provide an overview of the recent progress in higher-order model checking and discuss future directions.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Tohoku University"], "authors": ["Naoki Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi_0001:Naoki"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2011", "pages": 6}
