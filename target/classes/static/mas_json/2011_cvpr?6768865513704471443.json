We advance the state of the art in this area by fusing two popular representations of street-level image data \u2014 facade-aligned and viewpoint-aligned \u2014 and show that they contain complementary information that can be exploited to significantly improve the recall rates on the city scale. We also improve feature detection in low contrast parts of the street-level data, and discuss how to incorporate priors on a user's position (e.g. given by noisy GPS readings or network cells), which previous approaches often ignore. Finally, and maybe most importantly, we present our results according to a carefully designed, repeatable evaluation scheme and make publicly available a set of 1.7 million images with ground truth labels, geotags, and calibration data, as well as a difficult set of cell phone query images. We provide these resources as a benchmark to facilitate further research in the area.", "citation": "Citations (285)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["David M.
