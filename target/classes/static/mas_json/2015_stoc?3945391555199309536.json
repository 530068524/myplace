This problem is known to be NP-hard, and our main result is the first efficient constant-factor approximation algorithm for this objective. We first observe that the integrality gap of the natural fractional relaxation is exponential, so we propose a different fractional allocation which implies a tighter upper bound and, after appropriate rounding, yields a good integral allocation.   An interesting contribution of this work is the fractional allocation that we use. The relaxation of our problem can be solved efficiently using the Eisenberg-Gale program, whose optimal solution can be interpreted as a market equilibrium with the dual variables playing the role of item prices. Using this market-based interpretation, we define an alternative equilibrium allocation where the amount of spending that can go into any given item is bounded, thus keeping the highly priced items under-allocated, and forcing the agents to spend on lower priced items. The resulting equilibrium prices reveal more information regarding how to assign items so as to obtain a good integral allocation.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["New York University", "Stanford University", "New York University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Richard Cole.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cole_0001:Richard", "Vasilis Gkatzelis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gkatzelis:Vasilis"], "pages": 10}
