They are common in the life sciences and health sciences, where concepts such as genes, proteins or clinical trials are annotated with controlled vocabulary terms from ontologies. We present a tool, PAnG (Patterns in Annotation Graphs), that is based on a complementary methodology of graph summarization and dense subgraphs. The elements of a graph summary correspond to a pattern and its visualization can provide an explanation of the underlying knowledge. Scientists can use PAnG to develop hypotheses and for exploration.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Philip Anderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anderson_0003:Philip", "Andreas Thor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thor:Andreas", "Joseph Benik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benik:Joseph", "Louiqa Raschid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raschid:Louiqa", "Maria-Esther Vidal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidal:Maria=Esther"], "pages": 4}
