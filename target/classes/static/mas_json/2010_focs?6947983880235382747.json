The algorithm runs in time $$\\tilde{O}((m \\log{n} + n\\log^2{n})\\log(1/p)).$$ As a result, we obtain an algorithm that on input of an $n\\times n$ symmetric diagonally dominant matrix $A$ with $m$ non-zero entries and a vector $b$, computes a vector ${x}$ satisfying $| |{x}-A^{+}b| |_A", "citation": "Citations (218)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Ioannis Koutis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koutis:Ioannis", "Gary L.
