{"title": "Brownout: building more robust cloud applications.", "fields": ["source lines of code", "brownout", "automatic control", "crowds", "web application"], "abstract": "Self-adaptation is a first class concern for cloud applications, which should be able to withstand diverse runtime changes. Variations are simultaneously happening both at the cloud infrastructure level - for example hardware failures - and at the user workload level - flash crowds. However, robustly withstanding extreme variability, requires costly hardware over-provisioning.     In this paper, we introduce a self-adaptation programming paradigm called brownout. Using this paradigm, applications can be designed to robustly withstand unpredictable runtime variations, without over-provisioning. The paradigm is based on optional code that can be dynamically deactivated through decisions based on control theory.     We modified two popular web application prototypes - RUBiS and RUBBoS - with less than 170 lines of code, to make them brownout-compliant. Experiments show that brownout self-adaptation dramatically improves the ability to withstand flash-crowds and hardware failures.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "departments": ["Ume\u00e5 University", "Lund University", "Lund University", "Ume\u00e5 University"], "authors": ["Cristian Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Cristian", "Martina Maggio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maggio:Martina", "Karl-Erik \u00c5rz\u00e9n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Aring=rz=eacute=n:Karl=Erik", "Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez-Rodriguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hern=aacute=ndez=Rodriguez:Francisco"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
