{"title": "Understanding and overcoming parallelism bottlenecks in ForkJoin applications.", "fields": ["bridging", "memory management", "code refactoring", "concurrency", "work stealing"], "abstract": "ForkJoin framework is a widely used parallel programming framework upon which both core concurrency libraries and real-world applications are built. Beneath its simple and user-friendly APIs, ForkJoin is a sophisticated managed parallel runtime unfamiliar to many application programmers: the framework core is a work-stealing scheduler, handles fine-grained tasks, and sustains the pressure from automatic memory management. ForkJoin poses a unique gap in the compute stack between high-level software engineering and low-level system optimization. Understanding and bridging this gap is crucial for the future of parallelism support in JVM-supported applications. This paper describes a comprehensive study on parallelism bottlenecks in ForkJoin applications, with a unique focus on how they interact with underlying system-level features, such as work stealing and memory management. We identify 6 bottlenecks, and found that refactoring them can significantly improve performance and energy efficiency. Our field study includes an in-depth analysis of Akka \u2014 a real-world actor framework \u2014 and 30 additional open-source ForkJoin projects. We sent our patches to the developers of 15 projects, and 7 out of the 9 projects that replied to our patches have accepted them.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Binghamton University", "University of California, Irvine", "Binghamton University", "UFPA, Brazil", "UFPE, Brazil"], "authors": ["Gustavo Pinto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinto_0001:Gustavo", "Anthony Canino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canino:Anthony", "Fernando Castor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castor:Fernando", "Guoqing (Harry) Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Guoqing_=Harry=", "Yu David Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yu_David"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
