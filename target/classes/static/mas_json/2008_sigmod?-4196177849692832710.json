However, there is a lack of study on supporting ranking queries in data warehouses where ranking is on multidimensional aggregates instead of on measures of base facts. To address this problem, we propose a query execution model to answer different types of ranking aggregate queries based on a unified, partial cube structure,  ARCube . The query execution model follows a candidate generation and verification framework, where the most promising candidate cells are generated using a set of high-level guiding cells. We also identify a bounding principle for effective pruning: once a guiding cell is pruned, all of its children candidate cells can be pruned. We further address the problem of efficient online candidate aggregation and verification by developing a chunk-based execution model to verify a bulk of candidates within a bounded memory buffer. Our extensive performance study shows that the new framework not only leads to an order of magnitude performance improvements over the state-of-the-art method, but also is much more flexible in terms of the types of ranking aggregate queries supported.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Microsoft", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Tianyi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Tianyi", "Dong Xin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xin:Dong", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei"], "pages": 14}
