Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of functional graphs built from the iteration of HMAC or NMAC, we exhibit the very first generic universal forgery attack against hash-based MACs. In particular, our work implies that the universal forgery resistance of an n-bit output HMAC construction is not 2 n queries as long believed by the community. The techniques we introduce extend the previous functional graphs-based attacks that only took in account the cycle structure or the collision probability: we show that one can extract much more meaningful secret information by also analyzing the distance of a node from the cycle of its component in the functional graph.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Thomas Peyrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peyrin:Thomas", "Lei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0031:Lei"], "pages": 18}
