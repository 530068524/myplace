{"title": "Reliving the Past & Making a Harmonious Society Today: A Study of Elderly Electronic Hackers in China.", "fields": ["hacker", "harmonious society", "empowerment", "citizenship", "norm"], "abstract": "This paper tells a story of DIY (do it yourself) making that does not neatly fit more familiar narratives of making: as individual empowerment, as a democratizing force, and as technoscientific innovation. Drawing on ethnographic research with a collective of elderly electronic hackers in China, we provide insights into the socio-technical and politico-economic processes of hacking and making. This paper examines how the activity of making functioned for elderly DIY enthusiasts as way of remaking and reliving the past and as a means for expressing class belonging and citizenship. We show that making and hacking is not practiced in a void independent of social, political or economic forces. Rather, making unfolds in relation to, and is contingent on, societal norms and specific techno-cultural histories. As much as hacking empowers certain people, it excludes others and functions as a site for the exercise of power and social distinction making.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Yuling Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yuling", "Silvia Lindtner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindtner:Silvia", "Xianghua Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Xianghua", "Tun Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Tun", "Ning Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Ning"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
