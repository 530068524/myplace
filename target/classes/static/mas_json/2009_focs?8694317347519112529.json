{"title": "Integrality Gaps for Strong SDP Relaxations of UNIQUE GAMES.", "fields": ["hardness of approximation", "binary logarithm", "unique games conjecture", "linear inequality", "constraint satisfaction problem"], "abstract": "With the work of Khot and Vishnoi (FOCS 2005) as a starting point, we obtain integrality gaps for certain strong SDP relaxations of unique games. Specifically, we exhibit a gap instance for the basic semidefinite program strengthened by all valid linear inequalities on the inner products of up to $\\exp(\\Omega(\\log\\log~n)^{1/4})$ vectors. For stronger relaxations obtained from the basic semidefinite program by $R$ rounds of Sherali--Adams lift-and-project, we prove a unique games integrality gap for $R = \\Omega(\\log\\log~n)^{1/4}$.By composing these SDP gaps with UGC-hardness reductions, the above results imply corresponding integrality gaps for every problem for which a UGC-based hardness is known. Consequently, this work implies that including any valid constraints on up to$\\exp(\\Omega(\\log\\log~n)^{1/4})$ vectors to natural semidefinite program, does not improve the approximation ratio for any problem in the following classes: constraint satisfaction problems, ordering constraint satisfaction problems and metric labeling problems over constant-size metrics. We obtain similar SDP integrality gaps for balanced separator, building on Devanur et al. (STOC 2006). We also exhibit, for explicit constants $\\gamma, \\delta \u226b 0$, an n-point negative-type metric which requires distortion $\\Omega(\\log\\log n)^{\\gamma}$ to embed into$\\ell_1$, although all its subsets of size$\\exp(\\Omega(\\log\\log~n)^{\\delta})$ embed isometrically into $\\ell_1$.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Prasad Raghavendra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavendra:Prasad", "David Steurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steurer:David"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 11}
