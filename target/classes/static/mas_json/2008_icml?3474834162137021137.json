{"title": "Fast Gaussian process methods for point process intensity estimation.", "fields": ["point process", "inference", "continuous function", "renewal theory", "gaussian process"], "abstract": "Point processes are difficult to analyze because they provide only a sparse and noisy observation of the intensity function driving the process. Gaussian Processes offer an attractive framework within which to infer underlying intensity functions. The result of this inference is a continuous function defined across time that is typically more amenable to analytical efforts. However, a naive implementation will become computationally infeasible in any problem of reasonable size, both in memory and run time requirements. We demonstrate problem specific methods for a class of renewal processes that eliminate the memory burden and reduce the solve time by orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Gatsby Computat ...
