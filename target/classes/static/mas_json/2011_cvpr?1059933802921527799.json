We follow a popular framework for scalable visual learning, in which the data is first transformed by a nonlinear embedding and then an efficient linear classifier is trained in the resulting space. Our study includes data-dependent embeddings inspired by the semi-supervised learning literature, and data-independent ones based on approximating specific kernels (such as the Gaussian kernel for GIST features and the histogram intersection kernel for bags of words). Perhaps surprisingly, we find that data-dependent embeddings, despite being computed from large amounts of unlabeled data, do not have any advantage over data-independent ones in the regime of scarce labeled data. On the other hand, we find that several data-dependent embeddings are competitive with popular data-independent choices for large-scale classification.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yunchao Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Yunchao", "Svetlana Lazebnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazebnik:Svetlana"], "pages": 8}
