The beneficial outcome of this new construction is that, for the first time, provable guarantees are obtained on worst-case performance, thereby facilitating robust query processing.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Srinivas Karthik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karthik:Srinivas", "Jayant R.
