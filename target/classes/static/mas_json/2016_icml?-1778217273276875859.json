We present asynchronous variants of four standard reinforcement learning algorithms and show that parallel actor-learners have a stabilizing effect on training allowing all four methods to successfully train neural network controllers. The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the current state-of-the-art on the Atari domain while training for half the time on a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU. Furthermore, we show that asynchronous actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as well as on a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input.", "citation": "Citations (1,006)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Volodymyr Mnih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mnih:Volodymyr", "Adri\u00e0 Puigdom\u00e8nech Badia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badia:Adri=agrave=_Puigdom=egrave=nech", "Mehdi Mirza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mirza:Mehdi", "Alex Graves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Graves:Alex", "Timothy P.
