{"title": "Boosting concolic testing via interpolation.", "fields": ["heuristics", "interpolation", "symbolic execution", "concolic testing", "boosting"], "abstract": "Concolic testing has been very successful in automatically generating test inputs for programs. However one of its major limitations is path-explosion that limits the generation of high coverage inputs. Since its inception several ideas have been proposed to attack this problem from various angles: defining search heuristics that increase coverage, caching of function summaries, pruning of paths using static/dynamic information etc.     We propose a new and complementary method based on interpolation, that greatly mitigates path-explosion by subsuming paths that can be guaranteed to not hit a bug. We discuss new challenges in using interpolation that arise specifically in the context of concolic testing. We experimentally evaluate our method with different search heuristics using Crest, a publicly available concolic tester.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Joxan Jaffar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaffar:Joxan", "Vijayaraghavan Murali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murali:Vijayaraghavan", "Jorge A.
