Unfortunately, Model Checkers for such software suffer tremendously from combinatorial state space explosion. We show how to apply  counter abstraction  to real-world concurrent programs to factor out redundancy due to thread replication. The traditional global state representation as a vector of local states is replaced by a vector of thread counters, one per local state. In practice, straightforward implementations of this idea are unfavorably sensitive to the number of local states. We present a novel symbolic exploration algorithm that avoids this problem by carefully scheduling which counters to track at any moment during the search. Our experiments are carried out on Boolean programs, an abstraction promoted by the  Slam  project. To our knowledge, this marks the first application of counter abstraction to programs with non-trivial local state spaces, and results in the first scalable Model Checker for concurrent Boolean programs.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Computer Systems Institute", "Computer Systems Institute", "Computer Systems Institute", "Computer Systems Institute"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["G\u00e9rard Basler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basler:G=eacute=rard", "Michele Mazzucchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazzucchi:Michele", "Thomas Wahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wahl:Thomas", "Daniel Kroening.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kroening:Daniel"], "pages": 15}
