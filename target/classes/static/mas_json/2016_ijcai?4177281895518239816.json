{"title": "Heuristics and Really Hard Instances for Subgraph Isomorphism Problems.", "fields": ["heuristics", "induced subgraph isomorphism problem", "expected value", "phase transition", "subgraph isomorphism problem"], "abstract": "We show how to generate \"really hard\" random instances for subgraph isomorphism problems. For the non-induced variant, we predict and observe a phase transition between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances, with a corresponding complexity peak seen in three different solvers. For the induced variant, much richer behaviour is observed, and constrainedness gives a better measure of difficulty than does proximity to a phase transition. We also discuss variable and value ordering heuristics, and their relationship to the expected number of solutions.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Ciaran McCreesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCreesh:Ciaran", "Patrick Prosser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prosser:Patrick", "James Trimble.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trimble_0001:James"], "pages": 8}
