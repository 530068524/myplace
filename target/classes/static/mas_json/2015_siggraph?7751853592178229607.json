{"title": "Burning the medial axis.", "fields": ["computer graphics", "combinatorics", "geometry", "locus", "rendering", "computer science", "medial axis", "computer graphics images"], "abstract": "Medial axis is a classical shape descriptor that is widely used in computer graphics, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Defined elegantly as the locus of points with multiple nearest neighbors on the object boundary, the medial axis preserves both the structure and topology of the object in a compact form - a geometry that has one lower dimension than the object itself.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Saint Louis University", "Saint Louis University", "Saint Louis University"], "authors": ["Yajie Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Yajie", "Tao Ju.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ju:Tao", "David Letscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Letscher:David", "Erin W.
