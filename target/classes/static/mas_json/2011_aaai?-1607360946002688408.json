A specific AI architecture founded on this idea, OpenCogPrime, is described, in the context of its application to control virtual agents and robots. The manifestations of cognitive synergy in OpenCogPrime's procedural and declarative learning algorithms are discussed in some detail.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Xiamen University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Novamente LLC, Rockville MD"], "authors": ["Ben Goertzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goertzel:Ben", "Joel Pitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitt:Joel", "Jared Wigmore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigmore:Jared", "Nil Geisweiller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geisweiller:Nil", "Zhenhua Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Zhenhua", "Ruiting Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Ruiting", "Deheng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Deheng", "Gino Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Gino"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
