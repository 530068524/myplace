Introduced in the seminal work of Minsky and Papert (1969), this notion is central to some of the strongest algorithmic and complexity-theoretic results for constant-depth circuits. One problem that has remained open for several decades, with applications to computational learning and communication complexity, is to determine the maximum threshold degree of a polynomial-size constant-depth circuit in n variables. The best lower bound prior to our work was a#x03A9;(n((d -- 1)/(2d -- 1))) for circuits of depth d. We obtain a polynomial improvement for every depth d, with a lower bound of a#x03A9;(n(3/7)) for depth 3 and a#x03A9;(n(1/2)) for depth d a#x2265; 4. The proof contributes an approximation-theoretic technique of independent interest, which exploits asymmetry in circuits to prove their hardness for polynomials.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Alexander A.
