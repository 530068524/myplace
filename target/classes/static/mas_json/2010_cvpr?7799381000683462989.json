{"title": "Transductive segmentation of live video with non-stationary background.", "fields": ["transduction", "shadow", "color model", "scale space segmentation", "local color"], "abstract": "Online foreground extraction is very difficult due to the complexity of real scenes. Almost all the previous methods assume that the background is stationary, which not only incur unreliable result due to background activities like dynamic shadow, moving background objects etc., but also makes them hard to be extended to the case of non-stationary background. In this paper we assume that the background is continuous instead of stationary, and present a transductive video segmentation method that can handle dynamic scenes captured by a hand-held moving camera. The segmentation is propagated based on local color models and temporal prior, as well as a dynamic global color model (DGKDE) in the case of occlusion. A novel local color modeling method, FLKDE, is proposed to model both local color distribution and temporal prior at each pixel. FLKDE can be learned additively to reach real-time speed. Finally, a very fast geodesic-based method is adopted to solve for the segmentation. Experiments show that our method can generate good quality segmentation for wide variety of scenes, and can reach 15\u223c25 fps for 640\u00d7480 size of input image sequences.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Shandong University", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Fan Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Fan", "Xueying Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Xueying", "Qunsheng Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Qunsheng"], "pages": 8}
