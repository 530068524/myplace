{"title": "We want more: human-computer collaboration in mobile social video remixing of music concerts.", "fields": ["clips", "multimedia", "mobile music", "publishing", "automation"], "abstract": "Recording and publishing mobile video clips from music concerts is popular. There is a high potential to increase the concert's perceived value when producing video remixes from individual video clips and using them socially. A digital production of a video remix is an interactive process between human and computer. However, it is not clear what the collaboration implications between human and computer are.   We present a case study where we compare the processes and products of manual and automatic mobile video remixing. We provide results from the first systematic real world study of the subject. We draw our observations from a user trial where fans recorded mobile video clips during a rock concert.   The results reveal issues on heterogeneous interests of the stakeholders, unexpected uses of the raw material, the burden of editing, diverse quality requirements, motivations for remixing, the effect of understanding the logic of automation, and the collaborative use of manual and automatic remixing.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Nokia", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Tampere University of Technology", "Nokia"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sami Vihavainen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vihavainen:Sami", "Sujeet Mate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mate:Sujeet", "Lassi Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sepp=auml=l=auml=:Lassi", "Francesco Cricri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cricri:Francesco", "Igor D.
