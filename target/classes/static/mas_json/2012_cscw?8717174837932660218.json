{"title": "See friendship, sort of: how conversation and digital traces might support reflection on friendships.", "fields": ["conversation", "fidelity", "friendship", "social media", "lifelog"], "abstract": "Inspired by conversational visualization tools and the increasing enactment of relationships in social media, we examine how people reflect on friendships and how social data and conversation may affect this. We asked 28 people to reflect on their relationship with a close friend either alone, alone but with access to Facebook's \"See Friendship\" page, or with the friend using their See Friendship page. Observation and interviews revealed a rich array of practices around why, when, and how people reflect on friendships; that both friends and data make reflection more positive, more focused, and more fun; that those are not necessarily good things; and that third parties are a common theme. These findings suggest a number of design considerations, including supporting different types of reflection, aligning the interface with important moments and content useful for reflection, and carefully considering the fidelity of the visualization and data presented.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Victoria Schwanda Sosik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sosik:Victoria_Schwanda", "Xuan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xuan", "Dan Cosley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cosley:Dan"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
