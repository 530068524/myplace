The turn-by-turn directions provided in the existing navigation applications are exclusively derived from underlying road network topology information i.e., the connectivity of nodes to each other. Therefore, the turn-by-turn directions are simplified as metric translation of physical world (e.g. distance/time to turn) to spoken language. Such translation- that ignores human cognition about the geographic space- is often verbose and redundant for the drivers who have knowledge about the geographical areas. PerNav utilizes wealth of user generated historical trajectory data to extract namely \"landmarks\" (e.g., point of interests or intersections) and frequently visited routes between them from the road network. Then this extracted information is used to obtain cognitive turn-by-turn directions customized for each user.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Queensland", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yaguang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yaguang", "Han Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Han", "Ugur Demiryurek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demiryurek:Ugur", "Bolong Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Bolong", "Kai Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Kai", "Cyrus Shahabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shahabi:Cyrus"], "pages": 4}
