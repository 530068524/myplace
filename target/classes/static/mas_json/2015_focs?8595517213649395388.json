We also present efficient algorithms for subclasses: polynomial time for total transducers with unary output alphabet (over a given top-down regular domain language), and co-randomized polynomial time for linear transducers, these results are obtained using techniques from multi-linear algebra. For our main result, we prove that equivalence can be certified by means of inductive invariants using polynomial ideals. This allows us to construct two semi-algorithms, one searching for a proof of equivalence, one for a witness of non-equivalence.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Information Technology University", "University of Edinburgh", "Information Technology University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Bremen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Helmut Seidl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidl:Helmut", "Sebastian Maneth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maneth:Sebastian", "Gregor Kemper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kemper:Gregor"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
