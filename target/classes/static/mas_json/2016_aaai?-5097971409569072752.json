{"title": "Look-Ahead with Mini-Bucket Heuristics for MPE.", "fields": ["heuristic", "look ahead", "inference", "heuristics", "graphical model"], "abstract": "The paper investigates the potential of look-ahead in the context of AND/OR search in graphical models using the Mini-Bucket heuristic for combinatorial optimization tasks (e.g., MAP/MPE or weighted CSPs). We present and analyze the complexity of computing the residual (a.k.a. Bellman update) of the Mini-Bucket heuristic and show how this can be used to identify which parts of the search space are more likely to benefit from look-ahead and how to bound its overhead. We also rephrase the look-ahead computation as a graphical model, to facilitate structure exploiting inference schemes. We demonstrate empirically that augmenting Mini-Bucket heuristics by look-ahead is a cost-effective way of increasing the power of Branch-And-Bound search.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia"], "authors": ["Rina Dechter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dechter:Rina", "Kalev Kask.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kask:Kalev", "William Lam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lam:William", "Javier Larrosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larrosa:Javier"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
