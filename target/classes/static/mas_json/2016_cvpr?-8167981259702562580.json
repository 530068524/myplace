{"title": "Face2Face: Real-Time Face Capture and Reenactment of RGB Videos.", "fields": ["video capture", "facial expression", "rgb color model", "video tracking", "monocular"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach for real-time facial reenactment of a monocular target video sequence (e.g., Youtube video). The source sequence is also a monocular video stream, captured live with a commodity webcam. Our goal is to animate the facial expressions of the target video by a source actor and re-render the manipulated output video in a photo-realistic fashion. To this end, we first address the under-constrained problem of facial identity recovery from monocular video by non-rigid model-based bundling. At run time, we track facial expressions of both source and target video using a dense photometric consistency measure. Reenactment is then achieved by fast and efficient deformation transfer between source and target. The mouth interior that best matches the re-targeted expression is retrieved from the target sequence and warped to produce an accurate fit. Finally, we convincingly re-render the synthesized target face on top of the corresponding video stream such that it seamlessly blends with the real-world illumination. We demonstrate our method in a live setup, where Youtube videos are reenacted in real time.", "citation": "Citations (158)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Justus Thies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thies:Justus", "Michael Zollh\u00f6fer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zollh=ouml=fer:Michael", "Marc Stamminger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stamminger:Marc", "Christian Theobalt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobalt:Christian", "Matthias Nie\u00dfner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie=szlig=ner:Matthias"], "pages": 9}
