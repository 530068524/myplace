Query refinement typically includes a number of tasks such as spelling error correction, word splitting, word merging, phrase segmentation, word stemming, and acronym expansion. In previous research, such tasks were addressed separately or through employing generative models. This paper proposes employing a unified and discriminative model for query refinement. Specifically, it proposes a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model suitable for the problem, referred to as Conditional Random Field for Query Refinement (CRF-QR). Given a sequence of query words, CRF-QR predicts a sequence of refined query words as well as corresponding refinement operations. In that sense, CRF-QR differs greatly from  conventional  CRF models. Two types of CRF-QR models, namely a basic model and an extended model are introduced. One merit of employing CRF-QR is that different refinement tasks can be performed simultaneously and thus the accuracy of refinement can be enhanced. Furthermore, the advantages of discriminative models over generative models can be fully leveraged. Experimental results demonstrate that CRF-QR can significantly outperform baseline methods. Furthermore, when CRF-QR is used in web search, a significant improvement of relevance can be obtained.", "citation": "Citations (144)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Jiafeng Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jiafeng", "Gu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Gu", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Hang", "Xueqi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xueqi"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
