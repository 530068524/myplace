To explore the tradeoffs exposed by this difference, we refactor MUMmer, a widely-used, highly-engineered bioinformatics application which has both CPU- and GPU-based implementations. We synthesize our experience as three high-level guidelines to design efficient GPU-based applications. First, minimizing the communication overheads is as important as optimizing the computation. Second, trading-off higher computational complexity for a more compact in-memory representation is a valuable technique to increase overall performance (by enabling higher parallelism levels and reducing transfer overheads). Finally, ensuring that the chosen solution entails low pre- and post-processing overheads is essential to maximize the overall performance gains. Based on these insights, MUMmerGPU++, our GPU-based design of the MUMmer sequence alignment tool, achieves, on realistic workloads, up to 4x speedup compared to a previous, highly optimized GPU port.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Abdullah Gharaibeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gharaibeh:Abdullah", "Matei Ripeanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ripeanu:Matei"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
