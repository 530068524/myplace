Current filters in graph CNNs are built for fixed and shared graph structure. However, for most real data, the graph structures varies in both size and connectivity. The paper proposes a generalized and flexible graph CNN taking data of arbitrary graph structure as input. In that way a task-driven adaptive graph is learned for each graph data while training. To efficiently learn the graph, a distance metric learning is proposed. Extensive experiments on nine graph-structured datasets have demonstrated the superior performance improvement on both convergence speed and predictive accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "authors": ["Ruoyu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ruoyu", "Sheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Sheng", "Feiyun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Feiyun", "Junzhou Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Junzhou"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
