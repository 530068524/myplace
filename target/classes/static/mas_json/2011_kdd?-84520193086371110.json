{"title": "CHIRP: a new classifier based on composite hypercubes on iterated random projections.", "fields": ["random projection", "chirp", "hypercube", "curse of dimensionality", "iterated function"], "abstract": "We introduce a classifier based on the L-infinity norm. This classifier, called CHIRP, is an iterative sequence of three stages (projecting, binning, and covering) that are designed to deal with the curse of dimensionality, computational complexity, and nonlinear separability. CHIRP is not a hybrid or modification of existing classifiers; it employs a new covering algorithm. The accuracy of CHIRP on widely-used benchmark datasets exceeds the accuracy of competitors. Its computational complexity is sub-linear in number of instances and number of variables and subquadratic in number of classes.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Leland Wilkinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilkinson:Leland", "Anushka Anand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anand:Anushka", "Dang Tuan Nhon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nhon:Dang_Tuan"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
