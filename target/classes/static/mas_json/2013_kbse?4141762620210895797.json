TRAM provides such a support through a novel approach. By using a set of conceptual patterns to facilitate the transformation of an NLR to its target software model, TRAM has shown its potential as an automated tool to support the earliest phase of MDD. This paper describes TRAM and evaluates the tool against three benchmark approaches.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "University of Manchester"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Keletso Letsholo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Letsholo:Keletso", "Liping Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Liping", "Erol-Valeriu Chioasca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chioasca:Erol=Valeriu"], "pages": 4}
