{"title": "Shallow vs. Deep Sum-Product Networks.", "fields": ["deep belief network", "deep learning", "artificial neural network", "computation", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We investigate the representational power of sum-product networks (computation networks analogous to neural networks, but whose individual units compute either products or weighted sums), through a theoretical analysis that compares deep (multiple hidden layers) vs. shallow (one hidden layer) architectures. We prove there exist families of functions that can be represented much more efficiently with a deep network than with a shallow one, i.e. with substantially fewer hidden units. Such results were not available until now, and contribute to motivate recent research involving learning of deep sum-product networks, and more generally motivate research in Deep Learning.", "citation": "Citations (148)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Olivier Delalleau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delalleau:Olivier", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
