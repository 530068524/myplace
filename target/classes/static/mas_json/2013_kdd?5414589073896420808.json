The central problem is simple but tricky: given a crowdsourced task, who are the most knowledgable users to ask? In this demo, we show our framework that tackles the problem of crowdsourced task assignment on Twitter according to the social activities of its users. Since user profiles on Twitter do not reveal user interests and skills, we transfer the knowledge from categorized  Yahoo! Answers  datasets for learning user expertise. Then, we select the right crowd for certain tasks based on user expertise. We study the effectiveness of our system using extensive user evaluation. We further engage the attendees to participate a game called--Whom to Ask on Twitter?. This helps understand our ideas in an interactive manner.
