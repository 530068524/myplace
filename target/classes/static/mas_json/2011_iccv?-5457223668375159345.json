Even though recent approaches have shown that 3D pose estimation from monocular 2.5D depth images has become feasible, there are still challenging problems due to strong noise in the depth data and self-occlusions in the motions being captured. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust pose estimation framework for tracking full-body motions from a single depth image stream. Following a data-driven hybrid strategy that combines local optimization with global retrieval techniques, we contribute several technical improvements that lead to speed-ups of an order of magnitude compared to previous approaches. In particular, we introduce a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently extract pose features from the depth data and describe a novel late-fusion scheme based on an efficiently computable sparse Hausdorff distance to combine local and global pose estimates. Our experiments show that the combination of these techniques facilitates real-time tracking with stable results even for fast and complex motions, making it applicable to a wide range of inter-active scenarios.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Andreas Baak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baak:Andreas", "Meinard M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Meinard", "Gaurav Bharaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bharaj:Gaurav", "Hans-Peter Seidel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidel:Hans=Peter", "Christian Theobalt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobalt:Christian"], "pages": 8}
