Existing methods mainly focused on searching persons with image-based or attribute-based queries, which have major limitations for a practical usage. In this paper, we study the problem of person search with natural language description. Given the textual description of a person, the algorithm of the person search is required to rank all the samples in the person database then retrieve the most relevant sample corresponding to the queried description. Since there is no person dataset or benchmark with textual description available, we collect a large-scale person description dataset with detailed natural language annotations and person samples from various sources, termed as CUHK Person Description Dataset (CUHK-PEDES). A wide range of possible models and baselines have been evaluated and compared on the person search benchmark. An Recurrent Neural Network with Gated Neural Attention mechanism (GNA-RNN) is proposed to establish the state-of-the art performance on person search.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shuang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shuang", "Tong Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Tong", "Hongsheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongsheng", "Bolei Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Bolei", "Dayu Yue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yue:Dayu", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang"], "pages": 10}
