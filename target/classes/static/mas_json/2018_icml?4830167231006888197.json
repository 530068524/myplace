(2) We further show that M&M can be used successfully to progress through a curriculum of architectural variants defining an agents internal state. (3) Finally, we illustrate how a variant of our method can be used to improve agent performance in a multitask setting.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["DeepMind", "DeepMind", "DeepMind", "DeepMind", "DeepMind"], "authors": ["Wojciech Marian Czarnecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czarnecki:Wojciech_Marian", "Siddhant M.
