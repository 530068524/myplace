Our proposed algorithm integrates the proximal newton algorithm with multi-stage convex relaxation based on the difference of convex (DC) programming, and enjoys both strong computational and statistical guarantees. Specifically, by leveraging a sophisticated characterization of sparse modeling structures (i.e., local restricted strong convexity and Hessian smoothness), we prove that within each stage of convex relaxation, our proposed algorithm achieves (local) quadratic convergence, and eventually obtains a sparse approximate local optimum with optimal statistical properties after only a few convex relaxations. Numerical experiments are provided to support our theory.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "Princeton University", "University of Minnesota", "Tencent"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Haoran Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Haoran", "Rein Houthooft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Houthooft:Rein", "Davis Foote.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foote:Davis", "Adam Stooke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stooke:Adam", "Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0022:Xi", "Yan Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Yan", "John Schulman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schulman:John", "Filip De Turck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turck:Filip_De", "Pieter Abbeel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbeel:Pieter"], "pages": 10}
