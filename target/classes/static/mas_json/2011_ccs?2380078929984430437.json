Our rules enable encryption, blinding, homomorphic computation, and decryption, with selective key re-use for different types of payloads. We show that, under standard cryptographic assumptions, any well-typed probabilistic program using encryptions is secure that is, computationally non-interferent) against active adversaries, both for confidentiality and integrity. We illustrate our approach using %on classic schemes such as ElGamal and Paillier encryption. We present two applications of cryptographic verification by typing: (1) private search on data streams; and (2) the bootstrapping part of Gentry's fully homomorphic encryption. We provide a prototype typechecker for our system.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Microsoft", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["C\u00e9dric Fournet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fournet:C=eacute=dric", "J\u00e9r\u00e9my Planul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Planul:J=eacute=r=eacute=my", "Tamara Rezk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rezk:Tamara"], "pages": 10}
