Many works have been developed upon Dally's theory proving that a network is deadlock-free if there is no cyclic dependency on the channel dependency graph. However, finding such acyclic graph has been very challenging, which limits Dally's theory to networks with a low number of channels. In this paper, we introduce three theorems that directly lead to routing algorithms with an acyclic channel dependency graph. We also propose the partitioning methodology, enabling a design to reach the maximum adaptiveness for the n-dimensional mesh and k-ary n-cube topologies with any given number of channels. In addition, deadlock-free routing algorithms can be derived ranging from maximally fully adaptive routing down to deterministic routing. The proposed theorems can drastically remove the difficulties of designing deadlock-free routing algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Masoumeh Ebrahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ebrahimi:Masoumeh", "Masoud Daneshtalab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daneshtalab:Masoud"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
