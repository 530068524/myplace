Using a Gaussian process prior over the drift as a function of the state vector, we develop an approximate EM algorithm to deal with the unobserved, latent dynamics between observations. The posterior over states is approximated by a piecewise linearized process and the MAP estimation of the drift is facilitated by a sparse Gaussian process regression.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin"], "authors": ["Andreas Ruttor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruttor:Andreas", "Philipp Batz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Batz:Philipp", "Manfred Opper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Opper:Manfred"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
