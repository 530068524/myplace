However, since programs can be arbitrarily complicated, inducing them directly from question-answer pairs is a formidable challenge. To make this task more feasible, we solve these problems by generating answer rationales, sequences of natural language and human-readable mathematical expressions that derive the final answer through a series of small steps. Although rationales do not explicitly specify programs, they provide a scaffolding for their structure via intermediate milestones. To evaluate our approach, we have created a new 100,000-sample dataset of questions, answers and rationales. Experimental results show that indirect supervision of program learning via answer rationales is a promising strategy for inducing arithmetic programs.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Google", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Wang Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Wang", "Dani Yogatama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yogatama:Dani", "Chris Dyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dyer:Chris", "Phil Blunsom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blunsom:Phil"], "pages": 10}
