While previous participant selection approaches mainly focus on selecting a proper subset of users for a single MCS task, multi-task-oriented participant selection is essential and useful for the efficiency of large-scale MCS platforms. This paper proposes TaskMe, a participant selection framework for multi-task MCS environments. In particular, two typical multi-task allocation situations with bi-objective optimization goals are studied: (1) For FPMT (few participants, more tasks), each participant is required to complete multiple tasks and the optimization goal is to maximize the total number of accomplished tasks while minimizing the total movement distance. (2) For MPFT (more participants, few tasks), each participant is selected to perform one task based on pre-registered working areas in view of privacy, and the optimization objective is to minimize total incentive payments while minimizing the total traveling distance. Two optimal algorithms based on the Minimum Cost Maximum Flow theory are proposed for FPMT, and two algorithms based on the multi-objective optimization theory are proposed for MPFT. Experiments verify that the proposed algorithms outperform baselines based on a large-scale real-word dataset under different experiment settings (the number of tasks, various task distributions, etc.).", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Shenzhen Instit ... n 518055, China"], "authors": ["Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yan", "Bin Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Bin", "Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yang", "Wenle Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Wenle", "Zhiwen Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Zhiwen", "Daqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Daqing"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
