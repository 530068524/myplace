We present an algorithm for finding collisions that runs in quasi-linear time in the length of the hashed value. A concrete instance of the hash function is considered, based on a 100-digit prime. A short collision is given, together with implementation details.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Bordeaux"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Jean-Pierre Tillich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tillich:Jean=Pierre", "Gilles Z\u00e9mor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Z=eacute=mor:Gilles"], "pages": 16}
