{"title": "Provenance: On and Behind the Screens.", "fields": ["scheduling", "visualization", "provenance", "query language", "data mining"], "abstract": "Collecting and processing provenance, i.e., information describing the production process of some end product, is important in various applications, e.g., to assess quality, to ensure reproducibility, or to reinforce trust in the end product. In the past, different types of provenance meta-data have been proposed, each with a different scope. The first part of the proposed tutorial provides an overview and comparison of these different types of provenance. To put provenance to good use, it is essential to be able to interact with and present provenance data in a user-friendly way. Often, users interested in provenance are not necessarily experts in databases or query languages, as they are typically domain experts of the product and production process for which provenance is collected (biologists, journalists, etc.). Furthermore, in some scenarios, it is difficult to use solely queries for analyzing and exploring provenance data. The second part of this tutorial therefore focuses on enabling users to leverage provenance through adapted visualizations. To this end, we will present some fundamental concepts of visualization before we discuss possible visualizations for provenance.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Melanie Herschel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herschel:Melanie", "Marcel Hlawatsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hlawatsch:Marcel"], "pages": 5}
