This paper considers, for the first time, novel service scheduling problems from Human Factors (HF) standpoint by taking into consideration the following fact: a driver may not be able to receive more than one service in a short period of time, even if the VCPS can somehow transmit multiple services to the driver from the conventional communications and networking standpoint. We study a family of the HF-aware Service Scheduling (HFSS) Problems, where the goal is to deliver up to n services, each having a time-dependent (and non-increasing) utility to a subset of intended drivers so as to minimize the system-wide total utility loss due to unsuccessful delivery of some services. We show that such problems are different from all existing problems. We formulate the basic HFSS problem (BHFSSP) using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and prove it and other more general problems to be NP-Complete. We also propose efficient heuristics and present numerical results from large-scale test cases.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "Jilin University", "University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Xu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xu", "Xuegang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Xuegang", "Aditya Wagh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagh:Aditya", "Chunming Qiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiao:Chunming"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
