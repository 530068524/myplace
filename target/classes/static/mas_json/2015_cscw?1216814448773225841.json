{"title": "\"I LOVE THIS SITE!\" vs. \"It's a little girly\": Perceptions of and Initial User Experience with Pinterest.", "fields": ["social media", "impression", "survey research", "social media optimization", "user experience design"], "abstract": "Pinterest is a popular social networking site that lets people discover, collect, and share pictures of items from the Web. Among popular social media sites, Pinterest has by far the most skewed gender distribution: women are four times more likely than men to use it. To better understand this, we examined two factors that generally affect whether people try a social site and whether they continue using it: the external perception of a site (e.g., as conveyed in popular media) and the site's initial user experience. For the latter, we focused on the role of social bootstrapping, importing contacts from one social site to another. We conducted a survey study, finding that: perceptions of Pinterest among users and non-users of the site differed significantly; trying Pinterest led to substantial changes in user perceptions of the site; social bootstrapping affected users' initial impression of Pinterest, generally improving it for women and harming it for men. We present implications of our findings for design and research.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Hannah Jean Miller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miller:Hannah_Jean", "Shuo Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Shuo", "Loren G.
