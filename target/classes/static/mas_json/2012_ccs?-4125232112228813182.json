{"title": "Aligot: cryptographic function identification in obfuscated binary programs.", "fields": ["cryptovirology", "malware analysis", "obfuscation", "security of cryptographic hash functions", "storm botnet"], "abstract": "Analyzing cryptographic implementations has important applications, especially for malware analysis where they are an integral part both of the malware payload and the unpacking code that decrypts this payload. These implementations are often based on well-known cryptographic functions, whose description is publicly available. While potentially very useful for malware analysis, the identification of such cryptographic primitives is made difficult by the fact that they are usually obfuscated. Current state-of-the-art identification tools are ineffective due to the absence of easily identifiable static features in obfuscated code. However, these implementations still maintain the input-output (I/O) relationship of the original function. In this paper, we present a tool that leverages this fact to identify cryptographic functions in obfuscated programs, by retrieving their I/O parameters in an implementation-independent fashion, and comparing them with those of known cryptographic functions. In experimental evaluation, we successfully identified the cryptographic functions TEA, RC4, AES and MD5 both in synthetic examples protected by a commercial-grade packer (AsProtect), and in several obfuscated malware samples (Sality, Waledac, Storm Worm and SilentBanker). In addition, our tool was able to recognize basic operations done in asymmetric ciphers such as RSA.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Lorraine", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al", "University of Lorraine"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Joan Calvet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calvet:Joan", "Jos\u00e9 M.
