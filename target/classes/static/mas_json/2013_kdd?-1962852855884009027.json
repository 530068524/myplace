{"title": "Real-time disease surveillance using Twitter data: demonstration on flu and cancer.", "fields": ["disease surveillance", "popularity", "outbreak", "disease", "social media"], "abstract": "Social media is producing massive amounts of data on an unprecedented scale. Here people share their experiences and opinions on various topics, including personal health issues, symptoms, treatments, side-effects, and so on. This makes publicly available social media data an invaluable resource for mining interesting and actionable healthcare insights. In this paper, we describe a novel real-time flu and cancer surveillance system that uses spatial, temporal, and text mining on Twitter data. The real-time analysis results are reported visually in terms of US disease surveillance maps, distribution and timelines of disease types, symptoms, and treatments, in addition to overall disease activity timelines on our project website. Our surveillance system can be very useful not only for early prediction of seasonal disease outbreaks such as flu, but also for monitoring distribution of cancer patients with different cancer types and symptoms in each state and the popularity of treatments used. The resulting insights are expected to help facilitate faster response to and preparation for epidemics and also be very useful for both patients and doctors to make more informed decisions.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Kathy Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kathy", "Ankit Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Ankit", "Alok N.
