{"title": "C-DMr: Crowd-powered Decision Maker for real world Knapsack Problems.", "fields": ["data mining", "syllabus", "algorithm design", "database", "knapsack problem"], "abstract": "Knapsack problems range over a large sphere of real world challenges [?]. For example, every year a professor has to decide her new \u201csquad\u201d of students/staff from possibly hundreds of candidates, while having a restricted budget of funding in consideration. Moreover, in many cases, she has to resort to her colleagues and senior students to make comparisons among the candidates. The difficulties of such tasks are mainly three-fold: 1) the knowledge about the candidates are distributed among a crowd; 2) the underlying factors are human-intrinsic and hard to be formatted; 3) the size of candidates exceeds the capacity of human for a one-shot decision. Other examples in this category include gear set preparation for a venture trip, syllabus design for a popular course and inventory design for goods shelf, where the two difficulties are commonly observed. Consequently, a person may be heavily entangled to work out a final decision, which may even be inaccurate.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Leihao Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Leihao", "Caleb Chen Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Caleb_Chen", "Lei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0002:Lei", "Zhao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhao"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
