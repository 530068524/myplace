Moreover, the protocol is also nearly optimal in terms of resilience, providing computational security against an active, adaptive adversary corrupting a (1/2 i\u00be?  i\u00be? ) fraction of the players, for an arbitrary  i\u00be? > 0.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Ivan Damg\u00e5rd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damg=aring=rd:Ivan", "Yuval Ishai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishai:Yuval", "Mikkel Kr\u00f8igaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=oslash=igaard:Mikkel", "Jesper Buus Nielsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nielsen:Jesper_Buus", "Adam D.
