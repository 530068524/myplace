In this work, we provide experimental evidence that gaze direction can be safely approximated by user head rotation, in HMD-based Virtual Reality (VR) applications, where users actively interact with the environment. We discuss the application range of our approach and consider possible extensions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Hawaii", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia"], "authors": ["Andrei Sherstyuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sherstyuk:Andrei", "Arindam Dey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dey:Arindam", "Christian Sandor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sandor:Christian"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
