{"title": "The Complexity of Safe Manipulation under Scoring Rules.", "fields": ["voting", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "[Slinko and White, 2008] have recently introduced a new model of coalitional manipulation of voting rules under limited communication, which they call safe strategic voting. The computational aspects of this model were first studied by [Hazon and Elkind, 2010], who provide polynomial-time algorithms for finding a safe strategic vote under k- approval and the Bucklin rule. In this paper, we answer an open question of [Hazon and Elkind, 2010] by presenting a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a safe strategic vote under the Borda rule. Our results for Borda generalize to several interesting classes of scoring rules.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Auckland", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "University of Auckland"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Egor Ianovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ianovski:Egor", "Lan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Lan", "Edith Elkind.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkind:Edith", "Mark C.
