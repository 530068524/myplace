We designed and implemented a secure, robust and usable multi-expert recognizer, Garda, for gesture passwords. This demo demonstrates two real scenarios of using Garda as a gesture recognizer in mobile devices: under normal use and under a shoulder-surfing attack. As a supplement to the demo, we describe technical details of Garda in this report. Our demo shows the usability of our Garda gesture authentication method on mobile devices in daily life.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Can Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Can", "Gradeigh D.
