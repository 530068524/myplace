{"title": "Online Fair Division: Analysing a Food Bank Problem.", "fields": ["fair division", "price of anarchy", "competitive analysis", "online model", "axiom"], "abstract": "We study an online model of fair division designed to capture features of a real world charity problem. We consider two simple mechanisms for this model in which agents simply declare what items they like. We analyse axiomatic properties of these mechanisms such as strategy-proofness and envy freeness. Finally, we perform a competitive analysis and compute the price of anarchy.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["NICTA", "NICTA", "NICTA", "NICTA"], "authors": ["Martin Aleksandrov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aleksandrov:Martin", "Haris Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz_0001:Haris", "Serge Gaspers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaspers:Serge", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
