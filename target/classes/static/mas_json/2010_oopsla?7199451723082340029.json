{"title": "A domain-specific approach to architecturing error handling in pervasive computing.", "fields": ["software architecture", "architecture description language", "architectural pattern", "component based software engineering", "ranging"], "abstract": "The challenging nature of error handling constantly escalates as a growing number of environments consists of networked devices and software components. In these environments, errors cover a uniquely large spectrum of situations related to each layer ranging from hardware to distributed platforms, to software components. Handling errors becomes a daunting task for programmers, whose outcome is unpredictable. Scaling up error handling requires to raise the level of abstraction beyond the code level and the try-catch construct, approaching error handling at the software architecture level.   We propose a novel approach that relies on an Architecture Description Language (ADL), which is extended with error-handling declarations. To further raise the level of abstraction, our approach revolves around a domain-specific architectural pattern commonly used in pervasive computing. Error handling is decomposed into components dedicated to platform-wide, error-recovery strategies. At the application level, descriptions of functional components include declarations dedicated to error handling.   We have implemented a compiler for an ADL extended with error-handling declarations. It produces customized programming frameworks that drive and support the programming of error handling. Our approach has been validated with a variety of applications for building automation.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Julien Mercadal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mercadal:Julien", "Quentin Enard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Enard:Quentin", "Charles Consel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Consel:Charles", "Nicolas Loriant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loriant:Nicolas"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2010", "pages": 15}
