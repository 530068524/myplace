Let F be a distribution in R +  n(n-1)/2  with a coordinate for every pair ij with 1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 n. Then G F,p  is the distribution on graphs with n vertices obtained by picking a random point X from F and defining a graph on n vertices whose edges are pairs ij for which X ij  \u2264 p. The standard Erdos-Renyi model is the special case when F is uniform on the 0-1 unit cube. We determine basic properties such as the connectivity threshold for quite general distributions. We also consider cases where the X ij  are the edge weights in some random instance of a combinatorial optimization problem. By choosing suitable distributions, we can capture random graphs with interesting properties such as triangle-free random graphs and weighted random graphs with bounded total weight.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Alan M.
