Typically, these formulations use geodesic curves and distances defined locally for most cases -- this makes it hard to design parametric models globally on smooth manifolds. Thus, most (manifold specific) parametric models available today assume that the data lie in a small neighborhood on the manifold. To address this 'locality' problem, we propose a novel nonparametric model which unifies multivariate general linear models (MGLMs) using multiple tangent spaces. Our framework generalizes existing work on (both Euclidean and non-Euclidean) general linear models providing a recipe to globally extend the locallydefined parametric models (using a mixture of local models). By grouping observations into sub-populations at multiple tangent spaces, our method provides insights into the hidden structure (geodesic relationships) in the data. This yields a framework to group observations and discover geodesic relationships between covariates X and manifold-valued responses Y , which we call Dirichlet process mixtures of multivariate general linear models (DP-MGLM) on Riemannian manifolds. Finally, we present proof of concept experiments to validate our model.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Florida", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Hyunwoo J.
