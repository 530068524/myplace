We propose metrics for measuring the robustness of a neural net and devise a novel algorithm for approximating these metrics based on an encoding of robustness as a linear program. We show how our metrics can be used to evaluate the robustness of deep neural nets with experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our algorithm generates more informative estimates of robustness metrics compared to estimates based on existing algorithms. Furthermore, we show how existing approaches to improving robustness \u201coverfit\u201d to adversarial examples generated using a specific algorithm. Finally, we show that our techniques can be used to additionally improve neural net robustness both according to the metrics that we propose, but also according to previously proposed metrics.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Cambridge", "University of Pennsylvania", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Osbert Bastani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bastani:Osbert", "Yani Ioannou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ioannou:Yani", "Leonidas Lampropoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampropoulos:Leonidas", "Dimitrios Vytiniotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vytiniotis:Dimitrios", "Aditya V.
