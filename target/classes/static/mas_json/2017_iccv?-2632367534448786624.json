Compared to natural images, cells tend to have a simpler and more geometric global structure that facilitates image generation. However, the correlation between the spatial pattern of different fluorescent proteins reflects important biological functions, and synthesized images have to capture these relationships to be relevant for biological applications. We adapt GANs to the task at hand and propose new models with casual dependencies between image channels that can generate multichannel images, which would be impossible to obtain experimentally. We evaluate our approach using two independent techniques and compare it against sensible baselines. Finally, we demonstrate that by interpolating across the latent space we can mimic the known changes in protein localization that occur through time during the cell cycle, allowing us to predict temporal evolution from static images.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Trento", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "University of Cambridge", "University of Trento"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Anton Osokin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osokin:Anton", "Anatole Chessel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chessel:Anatole", "Rafael Edgardo Carazo-Salas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carazo=Salas:Rafael_Edgardo", "Federico Vaggi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaggi:Federico"], "pages": 10}
