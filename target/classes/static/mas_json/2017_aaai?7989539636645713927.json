Many previous works have considered cost-sensitive approaches in an online setting for streaming data, where fixed costs are assigned to different classes, or ad-hoc costs are adapted based on the distribution of data received so far. However, it is not necessary for them to achieve optimal performance in terms of the measures suited for imbalanced data, such as Fmeasure, area under ROC curve (AUROC), area under precision and recall curve (AUPRC). This work proposes a general framework for online learning with imbalanced streaming data, where examples are coming sequentially and models are updated accordingly on-the-fly. By simultaneously learning multiple classifiers with different cost vectors, the proposed method can be adopted for different target measures for imbalanced data, including F-measure, AUROC and AUPRC. Moreover, we present a rigorous theoretical justification of the proposed framework for the F-measure maximization. Our empirical studies demonstrate the competitive if not better performance of the proposed method compared to previous cost-sensitive and resampling based online learning algorithms and those that are designed for optimizing certain measures.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Iowa", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Yan Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Yan", "Tianbao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Tianbao", "Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yi", "Jianhui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jianhui"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
