{"title": "Crowd simulation using Discrete Choice Model.", "fields": ["crowd simulation", "heuristic", "software agent", "solid modeling", "discrete choice"], "abstract": "We present a new algorithm to simulate a variety of crowd behaviors using the Discrete Choice Model (DCM). DCM has been widely studied in econometrics to examine and predict customers' or households' choices. Our DCM formulation can simulate virtual agents' goal selection and we highlight our algorithm by simulating heterogeneous crowd behaviors: evacuation, shopping, and rioting scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Wenxi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wenxi", "Rynson W.
