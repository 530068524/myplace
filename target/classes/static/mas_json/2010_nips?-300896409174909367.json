{"title": "Parametric Bandits: The Generalized Linear Case.", "fields": ["generalization", "parametric statistics", "parameterized complexity", "multi armed bandit", "regret"], "abstract": "We consider structured multi-armed bandit problems based on the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework of statistics. For these bandits, we propose a new algorithm, called GLM-UCB. We derive finite time, high probability bounds on the regret of the algorithm, extending previous analyses developed for the linear bandits to the non-linear case. The analysis highlights a key difficulty in generalizing linear bandit algorithms to the non-linear case, which is solved in GLM-UCB by focusing on the reward space rather than on the parameter space. Moreover, as the actual effectiveness of current parameterized bandit algorithms is often poor in practice, we provide a tuning method based on asymptotic arguments, which leads to significantly better practical performance. We present two numerical experiments on real-world data that illustrate the potential of the GLM-UCB approach.", "citation": "Citations (129)", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Sarah Filippi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filippi:Sarah", "Olivier Capp\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capp=eacute=:Olivier", "Aur\u00e9lien Garivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garivier:Aur=eacute=lien", "Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szepesv=aacute=ri:Csaba"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
