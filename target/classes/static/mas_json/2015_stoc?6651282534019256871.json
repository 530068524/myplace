Bob similarly receives a tuple of t elements (b 1 ,...,b t ). They are promised that the interleaved product prod i \u2264 t  a i  b i  equals to either g and h, for two fixed elements g,h \u2208 G. Their task is to decide which is the case.   We show that for every t \u2265 2 communication \u03a9(t log |G|) is required, even for randomized protocols achieving only an advantage e = |G| -\u03a9(t)  over random guessing. This bound is tight, improves on the previous lower bound of \u03a9(t), and answers a question of Miles and Viola (STOC 2013). An extension of our result to 8-party number-on-forehead protocols would suffice for their intended application to leakage-resilient circuits.   Our communication bound is equivalent to the assertion that if (a 1 ,...,a t ) and (b 1 ,...,b t ) are sampled uniformly from large subsets A and B of G t  then their interleaved product is nearly uniform over G = SL(2,q). This extends results by Gowers (Combinatorics, Probability & Computing, 2008) and by Babai, Nikolov, and Pyber (SODA 2008) corresponding to the independent case where A and B are product sets. We also obtain an alternative proof of their result that the product of three independent, high-entropy elements of G is nearly uniform. Unlike the previous proofs, ours does not rely on representation theory.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Timothy Gowers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gowers:Timothy", "Emanuele Viola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viola:Emanuele"], "pages": 10}
