{"title": "A co-located interface for narration to support reconciliation in a conflict: initial results from Jewish and Palestinian youth.", "fields": ["negotiation", "narrative", "judaism", "face to face", "conflict resolution"], "abstract": "So called intractable conflicts may benefit from more modest and socially oriented approaches than those based on classical conflict resolution techniques. This paper is inspired by theories on small group intervention in a conflict. The general claim is that participants may achieve a greater understanding of and appreciation for the other's viewpoint under conditions that support partaking in a tangible joint task and creating a shared narration. Our goal was to design a methodology wherein the extent to which technology contributes to conflict negotiation and resolution could be assessed. Specifically, a co-located interface for producing a joint narration as a tool for favouring reconciliation is presented and discussed. The results of an initial set of studies where the interface was used by Arab and Jewish youth in Israel provided insight into the usability of the various components of the technology and of the paradigm.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Haifa", "University of Haifa", "FBK-irst, Trento, Italy", "FBK-irst, Trento, Italy", "FBK-irst, Trento, Italy"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Oliviero Stock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stock:Oliviero", "Massimo Zancanaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zancanaro:Massimo", "Chaya Koren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koren:Chaya", "Cesare Rocchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rocchi:Cesare", "Zvi Eisikovits.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisikovits:Zvi", "Dina Goren-Bar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goren=Bar:Dina", "Daniel Tomasini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomasini:Daniel", "Patrice L.
