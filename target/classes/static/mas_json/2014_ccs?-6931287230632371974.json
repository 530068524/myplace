{"title": "Clubbing Seals: Exploring the Ecosystem of Third-party Security Seals.", "fields": ["phishing", "cloud computing security", "web application security", "security service", "security through obscurity"], "abstract": "In the current web of distrust, malware, and server compromises, convincing an online consumer that a website is secure, can make the difference between a visitor and a buyer. Third-party security seals position themselves as a solution to this problem, where a trusted external company vouches for the security of a website, and communicates it to visitors through a security seal which the certified website can embed in its pages. In this paper, we explore the ecosystem of third-party security seals focusing on their security claims, in an attempt to quantify the difference between the advertised guarantees of security seals, and reality. Through a series of automated and manual experiments, we discover a real lack of thoroughness from the side of the seal providers, which results in obviously insecure websites being certified as secure. Next to the incomplete protection, we demonstrate how malware can trivially evade detection by seal providers and detail a series of attacks that are actually facilitated by seal providers. Among other things, we show how seals can give more credence to phishing attacks, and how the current architecture of third-party security seals can be used as a completely passive vulnerability oracle, allowing attackers to focus their energy on websites with known vulnerabilities.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Stony Brook University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Tom van Goethem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goethem:Tom_van", "Frank Piessens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piessens:Frank", "Wouter Joosen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joosen:Wouter", "Nick Nikiforakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikiforakis:Nick"], "pages": 12}
