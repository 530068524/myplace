{"title": "StarTrack Next Generation: A Scalable Infrastructure for Track-Based Applications.", "fields": ["client server model", "map matching", "systems architecture", "server", "service design"], "abstract": "Today's smartphone operating systems frequently fail to provide users with adequate control over and visibility into how third-party applications use their private data. We address these shortcomings with TaintDroid, an efficient, system-wide dynamic taint tracking and analysis system capable of simultaneously tracking multiple sources of sensitive data. TaintDroid provides realtime analysis by leveraging Android's virtualized execution environment. TaintDroid incurs only 14% performance overhead on a CPU-bound micro-benchmark and imposes negligible overhead on interactive third-party applications. Using TaintDroid to monitor the behavior of 30 popular third-party Android applications, we found 68 instances of potential misuse of users' private information across 20 applications. Monitoring sensitive data with TaintDroid provides informed use of third-party applications for phone users and valuable input for smartphone security service firms seeking to identify misbehaving applications.", "citation": "Citations (2,267)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Duke University", "Intel", "Duke University", "Intel", "North Carolina State University", "Duke University", "University of Washington", "North Carolina State University", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Maya Haridasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haridasan:Maya", "Iqbal Mohomed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohomed:Iqbal", "Doug Terry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terry:Doug", "Chandramohan A.
