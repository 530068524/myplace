In one second of computation on a $200 Core 2 Quad Q6600 CPU, this paper's software performs 30000 251-bit scalar multiplications on the binary Edwards curve d(x + x 2 + y + y 2) = (x + x 2)(y + y 2) over the field ${\\bf F}_2[t]/(t^{251}+t^7+t^4+t^2+1)$ where d = t 57 + t 54 + t 44 + 1. The paper's field-arithmetic techniques can be applied in much more generality but have a particularly efficient interaction with the completeness of addition formulas for binary Edwards curves.", "citation": "Citations (259)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Daniel J.
