Their expressive power, however, appears to be limited, especially when they are applied to more general structures than words, such as graphs. To address this drawback, weighted automata have recently been generalized to weighted pebble walking automata, which proved useful as a tool for the specification and evaluation of quantitative properties over words and nested words. In this paper, we establish the expressive power of weighted pebble walking automata in terms of transitive closure logic, lifting a similar result by Engelfriet and Hoogeboom from the Boolean case to a quantitative setting. This result applies to general classes of graphs, including all the aforementioned classes.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Benedikt Bollig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bollig:Benedikt", "Paul Gastin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gastin:Paul", "Benjamin Monmege.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monmege:Benjamin", "Marc Zeitoun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeitoun:Marc"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
