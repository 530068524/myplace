{"title": "Block iterative methods and recycling for improved scalability of linear solvers.", "fields": ["linear elasticity", "domain decomposition methods", "scalability", "multigrid method", "relaxation"], "abstract": "Contemporary large-scale Partial Differential Equation (PDE) simulations usually require the solution of large and sparse linear systems. Moreover, it is often needed to solve these linear systems with different or multiple Right-Hand Sides (RHSs). In this paper, various strategies will be presented to extend the scalability of existing multigrid or domain decomposition linear solvers using appropriate recycling strategies or block methods---i.e., by treating multiple right-hand sides simultaneously.   The scalability of this work is assessed by performing simulations on up to 8,192 cores for solving linear systems arising from various physical phenomena modeled by Poisson's equation, the system of linear elasticity, or Maxwell's equation.   This work is shipped as part of on open-source software, readily available and usable in any C/C++, Python, or Fortran code. In particular, some simulations are performed on top of a well-established library, PETSc, and it is shown how our approaches can be used to decrease time to solution down by 30%.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["ENSEEIHT", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Pierre Jolivet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jolivet:Pierre", "Pierre-Henri Tournier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tournier:Pierre=Henri"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
