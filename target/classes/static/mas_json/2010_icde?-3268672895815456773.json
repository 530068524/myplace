{"title": "Interactive physical design tuning.", "fields": ["physical design", "database tuning", "agile software development", "workload", "server"], "abstract": "In the last decade, automated physical design tuning became a relevant area of research. The process of tuning a workload became more flexible but also more complex, and getting the best design upfront became difficult. We propose a paradigm shift for physical design tuning, in which sessions are highly interactive, allowing DBAs to quickly try different options, identify problems, and obtain physical designs in an agile manner.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Nicolas Bruno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruno:Nicolas", "Surajit Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Surajit"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
