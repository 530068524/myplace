We show that it is possible to reduce unsupervised learning to supervised learning and demonstrate a high-quality un-supervised shift-reduce parsing model. We additionally show a close connection between unsupervised Searn and expectation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of a semi-supervised extension. The key idea that enables this is an application of the  predict-self  idea for unsupervised learning.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Utah"], "authors": ["Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
