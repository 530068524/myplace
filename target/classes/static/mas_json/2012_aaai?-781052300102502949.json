In this work, we propose a new method for batchmode reinforcement learning (RL) with continuous state variables. The method is an approximation to kernel-based RL on a set of k representative states. Similarly to kernel-based RL, our solution is a fixed point of a kernelized Bellman operator and can approximate the optimal solution to an arbitrary level of granularity. Unlike kernel-based RL, our method is fast. In particular, our policies can be computed in O(n) time, where n is the number of training examples. The time complexity of kernel-based RL is \u03c9(n2). We introduce our method, analyze its convergence, and compare it to existing work. The method is evaluated on two existing control problems with 2 to 4 continuous variables and a new problem with 64 variables. In all cases, we outperform state-of-the-art results and offer simpler solutions.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Technicolor", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Branislav Kveton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kveton:Branislav", "Georgios Theocharous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theocharous:Georgios"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
