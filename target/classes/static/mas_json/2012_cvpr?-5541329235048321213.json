{"title": "Cross-view activity recognition using Hankelets.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "activity recognition", "invariant", "test data", "ranging"], "abstract": "Human activity recognition is central to many practical applications, ranging from visual surveillance to gaming interfacing. Most approaches addressing this problem are based on localized spatio-temporal features that can vary significantly when the viewpoint changes. As a result, their performances rapidly deteriorate as the difference between the viewpoints of the training and testing data increases. In this paper, we introduce a new type of feature, the \u201cHankelet\u201d that captures dynamic properties of short tracklets. While Hankelets do not carry any spatial information, they bring invariant properties to changes in viewpoint that allow for robust cross-view activity recognition, i.e. when actions are recognized using a classifier trained on data from a different viewpoint. Our experiments on the IXMAS dataset show that using Hanklets improves the state of the art performance by over 20%.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Binlong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Binlong", "Octavia I.
