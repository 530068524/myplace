It demonstrates that materiality is one of four significant factors in the player experience of tabletop gaming and describes four domains of materiality in boardgaming settings. Further, building on understanding of non-use in HCI, it presents boardgames as a unique situation of parallel use, in which users simultaneously engage with a single game in both digital and material, non-digital environments.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Melissa J.
