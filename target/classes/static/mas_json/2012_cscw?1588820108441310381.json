This paper examines the use of web forums for diagnostic work in cloud computing. We argue that forums are not simply used to communicate information but that (with users attempting to negotiate and manage the attention of providers, forming coalitions, criticizing others, and framing problems in particular ways) forums are socially organised, value laden venues for information. We conclude that providers should focus not on improving communication, but more broadly on managing community.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of St Andrews", "University of St Andrews"], "authors": ["John Rooksby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rooksby:John", "Ali Khajeh-Hosseini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khajeh=Hosseini:Ali"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
