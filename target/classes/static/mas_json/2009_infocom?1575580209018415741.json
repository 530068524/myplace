{"title": "Shape Estimation Using Networked Binary Sensors.", "fields": ["perimeter", "estimation theory", "key distribution in wireless sensor networks", "binary data", "binary number"], "abstract": "An estimation method for the shape and size of a target object by using networked binary sensors whose locations are unknown is proposed. Each of those sensors, which indi- vidually are incapable of monitoring the target object's shape and size, sends only binary data describing whether or not it detects at every moment the target object. By using these data and the explicit formulas derived in this paper, we can estimate the size and the perimeter length of the target object even without sensor location information. An additional parameter, which is a function of the shape of the target object, can also be estimated when the target object is non-convex. I.
