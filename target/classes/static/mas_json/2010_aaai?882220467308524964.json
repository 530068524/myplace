Such a comparison can be quantified by determining the number of events that change the order of genes in a genome. Earlier Erdem and Tillier formulated the pairwise comparison of entire genomes as the problem of planning rearrangement events that transform one genome to the other. We reformulate this problem as a planning problem to extend its applicability to genomes with multiple copies of genes and with unequal gene content, and illustrate its applicability and effectiveness on three real datasets: mitochondrial genomes of Metazoa, chloroplast genomes of Campanulaceae, chloroplast genomes of various land plants and green algae.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Sabanc\u0131 University", "Sabanc\u0131 University"], "authors": ["Tansel Uras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uras:Tansel", "Esra Erdem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erdem_0001:Esra"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
