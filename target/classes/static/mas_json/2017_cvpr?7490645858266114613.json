{"title": "Social Scene Understanding: End-to-End Multi-person Action Localization and Collective Activity Recognition.", "fields": ["time delay neural network", "activity recognition", "inference", "recurrent neural network", "social actions"], "abstract": "We present a unified framework for understanding human social behaviors in raw image sequences. Our model jointly detects multiple individuals, infers their social actions, and estimates the collective actions with a single feed-forward pass through a neural network. We propose a single architecture that does not rely on external detection algorithms but rather is trained end-to-end to generate dense proposal maps that are refined via a novel inference scheme. The temporal consistency is handled via a person-level matching Recurrent Neural Network. The complete model takes as input a sequence of frames and outputs detections along with the estimates of individual actions and collective activities. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our algorithm on multiple publicly available benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Stanford University", "Idiap Research Institute", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Princeton University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Timur M.
