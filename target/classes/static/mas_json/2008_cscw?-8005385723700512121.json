{"title": "Imprint, a community visualization of printer data: designing for open-ended engagement on sustainability.", "fields": ["conversation", "information visualization", "interactive kiosk", "workgroup", "casual"], "abstract": "We introduce Imprint, a casual information visualization kiosk that displays data extracted from a printer queue. We designed the system to be open-ended, and to support a workgroup in reflection and conversation about the data. Imprint's visualizations depict environmental issues, such as energy consumption and paper consumption of the printers, as well as social information, such as popular concepts from the printed matter. Imprint is intended to spark reflection and conversation, and to bring data into discussions about paper usage and \"waste.\" Our goal is not to explicitly reduce paper, energy, or toner consumption, but instead to open conversations by community members. Our work highlights a design approach for semi-public displays of personal data.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Zachary Pousman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pousman:Zachary", "Hafez Rouzati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rouzati:Hafez", "John T.
