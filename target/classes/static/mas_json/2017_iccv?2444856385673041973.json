It is observed that some facial attributes (e.g. eyebrow thickness, gender) are robust to such variations. We present the first work to systematically explore how the fusion of face recognition features (FRF) and facial attribute features (FAF) can enhance face recognition performance in various challenging scenarios. Despite the promise of FAF, we find that in practice existing fusion methods fail to leverage FAF to boost face recognition performance in some challenging scenarios. Thus, we develop a powerful tensor-based framework which formulates feature fusion as a tensor optimisation problem. It is nontrivial to directly optimise this tensor due to the large number of parameters to optimise. To solve this problem, we establish a theoretical equivalence between low-rank tensor optimisation and a two-stream gated neural network. This equivalence allows tractable learning using standard neural network optimisation tools, leading to accurate and stable optimisation. Experimental results show the fused feature works better than individual features, thus proving for the first time that facial attributes aid face recognition. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on three popular databases: MultiPIE (cross pose, lighting and expression), CASIA NIR-VIS2.0 (cross-modality environment) and LFW (uncontrolled environment).", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Surrey", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Edinburgh", "Anyvision (NI) Ltd", "School of Elect ... omputer Science", "Anyvision (NI) Ltd", "Anyvision (NI) Ltd"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Guosheng Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Guosheng", "Yang Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Yang", "Yang Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Yang", "Zhihong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhihong", "Zheng Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zheng", "Sankha S.
