However, practical concerns require the attainment of satisfactory behavior within a short period of time. In this paper, we relax the PAC-MDP conditions to reconcile theoretically driven exploration methods and practical needs. We propose simple algorithms for discrete and continuous state spaces, and illustrate the benefits of our proposed relaxation via theoretical analyses and numerical examples. Our algorithms also maintain anytime error bounds and average loss bounds. Our approach accommodates both Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kenji Kawaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawaguchi:Kenji"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
