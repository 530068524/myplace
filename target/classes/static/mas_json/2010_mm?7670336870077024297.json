TOP-SURF offers the flexibility to vary descriptor size and supports very fast image matching. In addition to the source code for the visual word extraction and comparisons, we also provide a high level API and very large pre-computed codebooks targeting web image content for both research and teaching purposes.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Leiden University", "Leiden University", "Leiden University"], "authors": ["Bart Thomee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomee:Bart", "Erwin M.
