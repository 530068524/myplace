{"title": "The CQC Algorithm: Cycling in Graphs to Semantically Enrich and Enhance a Bilingual Dictionary: Extended abstract.", "fields": ["bilingual dictionary", "natural language processing", "cycling", "wordnet", "graph"], "abstract": "Bilingual machine-readable dictionaries are knowledge resources useful in many automatic tasks. However, compared to monolingual computational lexicons like WordNet, bilingual dictionaries typically provide a lower amount of structured information such as lexical and semantic relations, and often do not cover the entire range of possible translations for a word of interest. In this paper we present Cycles and Quasi-Cycles (CQC), a novel algorithm for the automated disambiguation of ambiguous translations in the lexical entries of a bilingual machine-readable dictionary.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Dipartimento di ... ersit\u00e0 di Roma", "Dipartimento di ... ersit\u00e0 di Roma"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Tiziano Flati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flati:Tiziano", "Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto"], "pages": 5}
