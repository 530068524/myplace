{"title": "UbiComp for animal welfare: envisioning smart environments for kenneled dogs.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "information management", "smart environment", "animal welfare", "welfare"], "abstract": "Whilst the ubicomp community has successfully embraced a number of societal challenges for human benefit, including healthcare and sustainability, the well-being of other animals is hitherto underrepresented. We argue that ubicomp technologies, including sensing and monitoring devices as well as tangible and embodied interfaces, could make a valuable contribution to animal welfare. This paper particularly focuses on dogs in kenneled accommodation, as we investigate the opportunities and challenges for a  smart kennel  aiming to foster canine welfare. We conducted an in-depth ethnographic study of a dog rehoming center over four months; based on our findings, we propose a welfare-centered framework for designing smart environments, integrating monitoring and interaction with information management. We discuss the methodological issues we encountered during the research and propose a  smart ethnographic  approach for similar projects.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Open University", "Open University", "Open University", "Open University", "University of Lincoln"], "authors": ["Clara Mancini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mancini:Clara", "Janet van der Linden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linden:Janet_van_der", "Gerd Kortuem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kortuem:Gerd", "Guy Dewsbury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dewsbury:Guy", "Daniel Mills.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mills:Daniel", "Paula Boyden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boyden:Paula"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
