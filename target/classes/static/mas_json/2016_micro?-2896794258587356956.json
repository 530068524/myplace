{"title": "Chameleon: Versatile and practical near-DRAM acceleration architecture for large memory systems.", "fields": ["channel", "server", "finite state machine", "scalability", "dimm"], "abstract": "The performance of computer systems is often limited by the bandwidth of their memory channels, but further increasing the bandwidth is challenging under the stringent pin and power constraints of packages. To further increase performance under these constraints, various near-DRAM acceleration (NDA) architectures, which tightly integrate accelerators with DRAM devices using 3D/2.5D-stacking technology, have been proposed. However, they have not prevailed yet because they often rely on expensive HBM/HMC-like DRAM devices which also suffer from limited capacity, whereas the scalability of memory capacity is critical for some computing segments such as servers. In this paper, we first demonstrate that data buffers in a load-reduced DIMM (LRDIMM), which is originally developed to support large memory systems for servers, are supreme places to integrate near-DRAM accelerators. Second, we propose  Chameleon , an NDA architecture that can be realized without relying on 3D/2.5D-stacking technology and seamlessly integrated with large memory systems for servers. Third, we explore three microarchitectures that abate constraints imposed by taking LRDIMM architecture for NDA. Our experiment demonstrates that a  Chameleon -based system can offer 2.13X higher geo-mean performance while consuming 34% lower geo-mean data transfer energy than a system that integrates the same accelerator logic within the processor.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Hadi Asghari Moghaddam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moghaddam:Hadi_Asghari", "Young Hoon Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:Young_Hoon", "Jung Ho Ahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahn:Jung_Ho", "Nam Sung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Nam_Sung"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
