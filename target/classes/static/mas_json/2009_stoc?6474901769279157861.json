Our results include: The number of copies of an H with an independent set of size s can be computed exactly in O*(2 s  n k-s+3 ) time. A minimum weight copy of such an H (with arbitrary real weights on nodes and edges) can be found in O(4 s+o(s)  n k-s+3 ) time. (The O* notation omits (k) factors.) These algorithms rely on fast algorithms for computing the permanent of a k x n matrix, over rings and semirings. The number of copies of any H having minimum (or maximum)  node-weight  (with arbitrary real weights on nodes) can be found in O(n \u03c9 k/3  + n 2k/3+o(1) ) time, where \u03c9  edge-weighted  triangle of weight exactly 0 in general graphs requires \u03a9(n 2.5-e ) time for all e > 0, unless the 3SUM problem on N numbers can be solved in O(N 2 - e ) time. This suggests that the edge-weighted problem is much harder than its node-weighted version.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["Institute for Advanced Study", "Institute for Advanced Study"], "authors": ["Virginia Vassilevska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vassilevska:Virginia", "Ryan Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams_0001:Ryan"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
