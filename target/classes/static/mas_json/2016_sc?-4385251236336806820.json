With phase two of the project starting, it is an excellent opportunity to explore the complete design and how it will address the needs of extreme scale platforms. This paper examines each layer of the proposed stack in some detail along with cross-cutting topics, such as transactions and metadata management.   This paper not only provides a timely summary of important aspects of the design specifications but also captures the underlying reasoning that is not available elsewhere. We encourage the broader community to understand the design, intent, and future directions to foster discussion guiding phase two and the ultimate production storage stack based on this work. An initial performance evaluation of the early prototype implementation is also provided to validate the presented design.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Sandia National Laboratories", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Segate Government Solutions"], "authors": ["Jay F.
