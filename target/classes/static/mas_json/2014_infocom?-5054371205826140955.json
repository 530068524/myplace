However, they only address the problem of deadline-based content propagation in the cellular system, given wireless environment characteriza- tion. In contrast, we cope with the traffic offloading issue from another perspective: the base station interference coordination problem. In particular, we aim at the minimization of the total transmission time spent by the base stations in order to inject contents into the network, and we leverage the recently proposed ABSF technique to keep under control intercell interference. We formulate an optimization problem, prove that it is NP- Complete, and propose a near-optimal heuristic. Our proposed al- gorithm substantially outperforms classical intercell interference approaches proposed in the literature, as we evaluate through the simulation of dense LTE-A network scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["IMDEA Networks", "IMDEA Networks", "IMDEA Networks", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Dipt. di Elettr ... o, Milan, Italy"], "authors": ["Vincenzo Sciancalepore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sciancalepore:Vincenzo", "Vincenzo Mancuso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mancuso:Vincenzo", "Albert Banchs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banchs:Albert", "Shmuel Zaks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaks:Shmuel", "Antonio Capone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capone:Antonio"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
