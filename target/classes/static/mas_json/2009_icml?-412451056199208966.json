We describe Sparse Higher Order Conditional Random Fields (SHO-CRFs), which are able to handle local features and sparse higher order features together using a novel tractable exact inference algorithm. Our main insight is that states and transitions with same potential functions can be grouped together, and inference is performed on the grouped states and transitions. Though the complexity is not polynomial, SHO-CRFs are still efficient in practice because of the feature sparseness. Experimental results on optical character recognition and Chinese organization name recognition show that with the same higher order feature set, SHO-CRFs significantly outperform previous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Xian Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Xian", "Xiaoqian Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Xiaoqian", "Qi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Qi", "Xuanjing Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xuanjing", "Lide Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Lide"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
