We describe in detail how we adapt and extend the CD-DNNHMM (Dahl et al., 2012) method introduced in speech recognition to the HMMbased word alignment model, in which bilingual word embedding is discriminatively learnt to capture lexical translation information, and surrounding words are leveraged to model context information in bilingual sentences. While being capable to model the rich bilingual correspondence, our method generates a very compact model with much fewer parameters. Experiments on a large scale EnglishChinese word alignment task show that the proposed method outperforms the HMM and IBM model 4 baselines by 2 points in F-score.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Nan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Nan", "Shujie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Shujie", "Mu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mu", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming", "Nenghai Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Nenghai"], "pages": 10}
