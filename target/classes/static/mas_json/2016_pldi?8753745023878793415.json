{"title": "Verified lifting of stencil computations.", "fields": ["maintainability", "program synthesis", "stencil", "domain specific language", "software portability"], "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a novel combination of program synthesis and verification to lift stencil computations from low-level Fortran code to a high-level summary expressed using a predicate language. The technique is sound and mostly automated, and leverages counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) to find provably correct translations. Lifting existing code to a high-performance description language has a number of benefits, including maintainability and performance portability. For example, our experiments show that the lifted summaries can enable domain specific compilers to do a better job of parallelization as compared to an off-the-shelf compiler working on the original code, and can even support fully automatic migration to hardware accelerators such as GPUs. We have implemented verified lifting in a system called STNG and have evaluated it using microbenchmarks, mini-apps, and real-world applications. We demonstrate the benefits of verified lifting by first automatically summarizing Fortran source code into a high-level predicate language, and subsequently translating the lifted summaries into Halide, with the translated code achieving median performance speedups of 4.1X and up to 24X for non-trivial stencils as compared to the original implementation.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Adobe Systems", "University of Washington", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Shoaib Kamil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamil:Shoaib", "Alvin Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Alvin", "Shachar Itzhaky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Itzhaky:Shachar", "Armando Solar-Lezama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solar=Lezama:Armando"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2016", "pages": 16}
