This problem is challenging due to the requirement of high speed data processing within limited space cost. In this paper, we present a novel framework for monitoring anomalies over continuous trajectory streams. First, we illustrate the importance of distance-based anomaly monitoring over moving object trajectories. Then, we utilize the local continuity characteristics of trajectories to build  local clusters  upon trajectory streams and monitor anomalies via efficient pruning strategies. Finally, we propose a  piecewise metric index structure  to reschedule the joining order of local clusters to further reduce the time cost. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.", "citation": "Citations (139)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Yingyi Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Yingyi", "Lei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0002:Lei", "Ada Wai-Chee Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Ada_Wai=Chee", "Dawei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Dawei"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
