{"title": "APPAREIL: A Tool for Building Automated Program Translators Using Annotated Grammars.", "fields": ["equivalence", "rule based machine translation", "correctness", "control flow", "generic programming"], "abstract": "Operations languages are used to write spacecraft operations procedures. The APPAREIL tool automates the process of generating program translators between operations languages, from a specification of their language grammar annotated with extra information. From these annotated grammars the tool automatically produces a partial translator that covers most of the translation. This translator needs to be augmented manually with specific transformations, to deal with the more complicated cases. To get more confidence on the correctness of the translation, the tool offers a control-flow equivalence verification module.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain"], "authors": ["Diego Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez Camacho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camacho:Diego_Ord=oacute==ntilde=ez", "Kim Mens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mens:Kim"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
