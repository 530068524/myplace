In this paper, we identify an interesting and practical problem of mining user preferences: in a multidimensional space where the user preferences on some categorical attributes are unknown, from some superior and inferior examples provided by a user, can we learn about the user's preferences on those categorical attributes? We model the problem systematically and show that mining user preferences from superior and inferior examples is challenging. Although the problem has great potential in practice, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been explored systematically before. As the first attempt to tackle the problem, we propose a greedy method and show that our method is practical using real data sets and synthetic data sets.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "University of New South Wales", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Bin Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Bin", "Jian Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Jian", "Xuemin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xuemin", "David W.
