In this paper, we use real measurements to show there is significant frequency diversity in Wi-Fi channels, and propose a series of techniques to explicitly harness such frequency diversity. In particular, we leverage the Channel State Information (CSI), which captures the SNR on each subcarrier to (i) map symbols to subcarriers according to their importance, (ii) effectively recover partially corrupted FEC groups and facilitate FEC decoding, and (iii) develop MAC-layer FEC to offer different degrees of protection to the symbols according to their error rates at the PHY layer. We further develop a rate adaptation approach that works together with these optimization schemes. Our trace-driven simulation and testbed experiments based on USRP clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Apurv Bhartia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhartia:Apurv", "Yi-Chao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yi=Chao", "Swati Rallapalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rallapalli:Swati", "Lili Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Lili"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
