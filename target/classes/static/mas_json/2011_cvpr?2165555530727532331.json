Prior work in this area has been restricted to using K-means type clustering over the Rieman-nian space using the Riemannian metric. As the applications scale, it is not practical to assume the number of components in a clustering model, failing any soft-clustering algorithm. In this paper, a novel application of the Dirich-let Process Mixture Model framework is proposed towards unsupervised clustering of symmetric positive definite matrices. We approach the problem by extending the existing K-means type clustering algorithms based on the logdet divergence measure and derive the counterpart of it in a Bayesian framework, which leads to the Wishart-Inverse Wishart conjugate pair. Alternative possibilities based on the matrix Frobenius norm and log-Euclidean measures are also proposed. The models are extensively compared using two real-world datasets against the state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate superior performance.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "Honeywell"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Anoop Cherian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cherian:Anoop", "Vassilios Morellas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morellas:Vassilios", "Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papanikolopoulos:Nikolaos", "Saad Bedros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bedros:Saad"], "pages": 8}
