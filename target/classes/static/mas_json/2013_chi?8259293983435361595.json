Based on moral balancing and consistency effects, we designed an online experiment to test if signing or not signing an online petition increased or decreased subsequent contribution to a charity. We found that participants who signed the online petition were significantly more likely to donate money to a related charity, demonstrating a consistency effect. We also found that participants who did not sign the petition donated significantly more money to an unrelated charity, demonstrating a moral balancing effect. The results suggest that exposure to an online activism influences individual decision on subsequent civic actions.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yu-Hao Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yu=Hao", "Gary Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Gary"], "pages": 10}
