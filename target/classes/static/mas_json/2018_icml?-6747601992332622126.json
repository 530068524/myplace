{"title": "RadialGAN: Leveraging multiple datasets to improve target-specific predictive models using Generative Adversarial Networks.", "fields": ["machine learning", "generative grammar", "pattern recognition", "software deployment", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "Training complex machine learning models for prediction often requires a large amount of data that is not always readily available. Leveraging these external datasets from related but different sources is therefore an important task if good predictive models are to be built for deployment in settings where data can be rare. In this paper we propose a novel approach to the problem in which we use multiple GAN architectures to learn to translate from one dataset to another, thereby allowing us to effectively enlarge the target dataset, and therefore learn better predictive models than if we simply used the target dataset. We show the utility of such an approach, demonstrating that our method improves the prediction performance on the target domain over using just the target dataset and also show that our framework outperforms several other benchmarks on a collection of real-world medical datasets.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Jinsung Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Jinsung", "James Jordon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jordon:James", "Mihaela van der Schaar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaar:Mihaela_van_der"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
