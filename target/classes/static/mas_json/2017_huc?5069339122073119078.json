{"title": "CamTrackPoint: pointing stick for mobile device using rear camera.", "fields": ["haptic technology", "index finger", "pointing stick", "finger tracking", "gesture"], "abstract": "We present CamTrackPoint, a new input interface that can be controlled by index finger gestures captured by the rear camera of a mobile device. CamTrackPoint mounts a 3D-printed ring on the rear camera's bezel, and it senses the movement of the user's finger by tracking the light passed through the finger. The proposed method provides mobile devices with a new low cost input interface that offers physical force feedback like a pointing stick. The cost of our method is low as it needs only a simple ring-shaped part on the camera bezel. Moreover, if finger gestures are not being made, the camera has an unobscured view. We prototype the proposed method and evaluate its precision. This paper discusses the unique characteristics and possible applications of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo"], "authors": ["Wataru Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada:Wataru", "Hiroyuki Manabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manabe:Hiroyuki", "Hiroyuki Hakoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hakoda:Hiroyuki", "Keiichi Ochiai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ochiai:Keiichi", "Daizo Ikeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikeda:Daizo"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
