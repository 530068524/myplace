We introduce new methods to exploit the currently available facial databases for dataset construction and tailor a deep convolutional neural network to the task of estimating facial surface normals in-the-wild. We train a fully convolutional network that can accurately recover facial normals from images including a challenging variety of expressions and facial poses. We compare against state-of-the-art face Shape-from-Shading and 3D reconstruction techniques and show that the proposed network can recover substantially more accurate and realistic normals. Furthermore, in contrast to other existing face-specific surface recovery methods, we do not require the solving of an explicit alignment step due to the fully convolutional nature of our network.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "University College London", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["George Trigeorgis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trigeorgis:George", "Patrick Snape.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snape:Patrick", "Iasonas Kokkinos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kokkinos:Iasonas", "Stefanos Zafeiriou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zafeiriou:Stefanos"], "pages": 10}
