By considering pairs of alternatives, SSB utility theory generalizes von Neumann and Morgenstern's expected utility (EU) theory to encompass rational decision behaviors that EU cannot accommodate. We provide a game-theoretic analysis of the problem of identifying an SSB-optimal policy in finite horizon MDPs and propose an algorithm based on a double oracle approach for computing an optimal (possibly randomized) policy. Finally, we present and discuss experimental results where SSB-optimal policies are computed for a popular TV contest according to several instantiations of SSB utility functions.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Hugo Gilbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilbert:Hugo", "Olivier Spanjaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spanjaard:Olivier", "Paolo Viappiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viappiani:Paolo", "Paul Weng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weng:Paul"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
