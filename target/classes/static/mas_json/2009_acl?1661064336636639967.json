In this paper, we present an error analysis of a new cross-lingual task: the 5W task, a sentence-level understanding task which seeks to return the English 5W's (Who, What, When, Where and Why) corresponding to a Chinese sentence. We analyze systems that we developed, identifying specific problems in language processing and MT that cause errors. The best cross-lingual 5W system was still 19% worse than the best monolingual 5W system, which shows that MT significantly degrades sentence-level understanding. Neither source-language nor target-language analysis was able to circumvent problems in MT, although each approach had advantages relative to the other. A detailed error analysis across multiple systems suggests directions for future research on the problem.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "New York University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jong-Hoon Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Jong=Hoon", "Kiyotaka Uchimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uchimoto:Kiyotaka", "Kentaro Torisawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torisawa:Kentaro"], "pages": 9}
