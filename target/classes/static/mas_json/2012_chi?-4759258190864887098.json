This paper investigates suitable real-world mappings of foot gestures to invoke commands and interact with virtual workspaces. Our first study identified user preferences for mapping common mobile-device commands to gestures. We distinguish these gestures in terms of discrete and continuous command input. While discrete foot-based input has relatively few parameters to control, continuous input requires careful design considerations on how the user's input can be mapped to a control parameter (e.g. the volume knob of the media player). We investigate this issue further through three user-studies. Our results show that rate-based techniques are significantly faster, more accurate and result if far fewer target crossings compared to displacement-based interaction. We discuss these findings and identify design recommendations.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Manitoba", "University of Bristol"], "authors": ["Jason Alexander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alexander:Jason", "Teng Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Teng", "William Judd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Judd:William", "Pourang Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Pourang", "Sriram Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Sriram"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
