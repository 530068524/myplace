In contrast to sequences of instantaneous events, e-sequences contain events that have a duration. In Information Retrieval applications, e-sequences are used for American Sign Language. We show that the subsequence-search problem is NP-hard and provide an exact (worst-case exponential) algorithm. We extend our algorithm to handle different cases of subsequence matching with errors. We then propose the Relation Index, a scheme for speeding up exact retrieval, which we benchmark against several indexing schemes.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Aalto University"], "authors": ["Orestis Kostakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakis:Orestis", "Aristides Gionis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gionis:Aristides"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
