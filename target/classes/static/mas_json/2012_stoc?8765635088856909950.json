Guruswami and Zhou conjectured a characterization of constraint languages for which the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem admits an efficient robust algorithm. This paper confirms their conjecture.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["McMaster University", "Jagiellonian University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Libor Barto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barto:Libor", "Marcin Kozik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozik:Marcin"], "pages": 10}
