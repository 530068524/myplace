{"title": "Identifying Generic Noun Phrases.", "fields": ["expression", "natural language processing", "noun phrase", "formal semantics", "encoding"], "abstract": "This paper presents a supervised approach for identifying generic noun phrases in context. Generic statements express rule-like knowledge about kinds or events. Therefore, their identification is important for the automatic construction of knowledge bases. In particular, the distinction between generic and non-generic statements is crucial for the correct encoding of generic and instance-level information. Generic expressions have been studied extensively in formal semantics. Building on this work, we explore a corpus-based learning approach for identifying generic NPs, using selections of linguistically motivated features. Our results perform well above the baseline and existing prior work.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Nils Reiter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reiter:Nils", "Anette Frank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frank:Anette"], "pages": 10}
