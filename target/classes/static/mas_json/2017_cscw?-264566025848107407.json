Interoperation is achieved through front-loaded work and epistemically charged negotiation that thereafter become infrastructural, that is, supporting downstream actions without fully revealing the underpinnings that enable those actions. Drawing from ethnographic and archival investigations of data interoperation within and across an ecology of HIV/AIDS research infrastructures, this paper offers several sensitizing concepts for the investigation of how data are brought together and thereafter circulate. Data interoperability is historical, infrastructural, relatively irreversible, negotiated, epistemic, seamful and seamless, and is approaching the status of a general value rather than a specific means to an end.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Washington"], "authors": ["Pablo Paredes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paredes:Pablo", "Ana Rufino Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Ana_Rufino", "Cory Schillaci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schillaci:Cory", "Gene Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Gene", "Pierre Karashchuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karashchuk:Pierre", "Dennis Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Dennis", "Coye Cheshire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheshire:Coye", "John F.
