While businesses strive to adopt industry-accepted system-hardening standards such as benchmarks recommended by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) to combat threats, they are confronted with an additional challenge of ever-evolving regulations that address security concerns. These create additional requirements, which must be incorporated into software systems. In this paper, we present a generic approach towards automating different activities of the Security Compliance Value Chain (SCVC) in organizations. We discuss the approach in the context of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) regulations. Specifically, we present automation of (1) interpretation of PCI-DSS regulations to infer system requirements, (2) traceability of the inferred system requirements to CIS security controls (3) implementation of appropriate security controls, and finally, (4) verification and reporting of compliance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tata Consultancy Services", "Tata Consultancy Services", "Tata Consultancy Services", "Tata Consultancy Services", "Tata Consultancy Services"], "authors": ["Smita Ghaisas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghaisas:Smita", "Manish Motwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Motwani:Manish", "Balaji Balasubramaniam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balasubramaniam:Balaji", "Anjali Gajendragadkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gajendragadkar:Anjali", "Rahul Kelkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelkar:Rahul", "Harrick M.
