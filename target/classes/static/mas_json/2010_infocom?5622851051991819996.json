Each of them, however, either cannot guarantee successful data retrieval or demands a great deal of message overhead to replicate the data. In this paper, we propose a GPS-free information brokerage scheme, RDRIB, in which the double-ruling technique is used to replicate and retrieve the data. RDRIB guarantees successful data retrieval, and, in addition, simulations show that RDRIB has good performance in terms of the replication message overhead and the construction message overhead.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University"], "authors": ["Chia-Hung Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chia=Hung", "Jian-Jhih Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Jian=Jhih", "Ming-Jer Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Ming=Jer"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
