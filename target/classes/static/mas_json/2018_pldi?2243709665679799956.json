{"title": "PMAF: an algebraic framework for static analysis of probabilistic programs.", "fields": ["dataflow", "recursion", "program analysis", "correctness", "static analysis"], "abstract": "Automatically establishing that a probabilistic program satisfies some property \u03d5 is a challenging problem. While a sampling-based approach\u2014which involves running the program repeatedly\u2014can  suggest  that \u03d5 holds, to establish that the program  satisfies  \u03d5, analysis techniques must be used. Despite recent successes, probabilistic static analyses are still more difficult to design and implement than their deterministic counterparts. This paper presents a framework, called  PMAF , for designing, implementing, and proving the correctness of static analyses of probabilistic programs with challenging features such as recursion, unstructured control-flow, divergence, nondeterminism, and continuous distributions. PMAF introduces  pre-Markov algebras  to factor out common parts of different analyses. To perform  interprocedural analysis  and to create  procedure summaries , PMAF extends ideas from non-probabilistic interprocedural dataflow analysis to the probabilistic setting. One novelty is that PMAF is based on a semantics formulated in terms of a control-flow  hyper-graph  for each procedure, rather than a standard control-flow graph. To evaluate its effectiveness, PMAF has been used to reformulate and implement existing  intra procedural analyses for Bayesian-inference and the Markov decision problem, by creating corresponding  inter procedural analyses. Additionally, PMAF has been used to implement a new interprocedural  linear expectation-invariant analysis . Experiments with benchmark programs for the three analyses demonstrate that the approach is practical.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Di Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Di", "Jan Hoffmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoffmann_0002:Jan", "Thomas W.
