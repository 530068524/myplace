{"title": "Dynamic Embeddings for User Profiling in Twitter.", "fields": ["word embedding", "profiling", "inference", "topic model", "embedding"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of dynamic user profiling in Twitter. We address the problem by proposing a dynamic user and word embedding model (DUWE), a scalable black-box variational inference algorithm, and a streaming keyword diversification model (SKDM). DUWE dynamically tracks the semantic representations of users and words over time and models their embeddings in the same space so that their similarities can be effectively measured. Our inference algorithm works with a convex objective function that ensures the robustness of the learnt embeddings. SKDM aims at retrieving top-K relevant and diversified keywords to profile users' dynamic interests. Experiments on a Twitter dataset demonstrate that our proposed embedding algorithms outperform state-of-the-art non-dynamic and dynamic embedding and topic models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "University of Amsterdam", "Data Science La ...
