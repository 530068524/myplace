We establish that the bounding games of Jurdzinski et al. (ICALP 2015) can be reduced to perfect half space games, which in turn can be translated to the lexicographic energy games of Colcombet and Niwinski, and are positionally determined in a strong sense (Player 2 can play without knowing the current perfect half space). We finally show how perfect half space games and bounding games can be employed to solve multi-dimensional energy parity games in pseudo-polynomial time when both the numbers of energy dimensions and of priorities are fixed, regardless of whether the initial credit is given as part of the input or existentially quantified. This also yields an optimal 2-EXPTIME complexity with given initial credit, where the best known upper bound was non-elementary.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Paris Diderot University", "University of Warwick", "University of Warwick", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"], "authors": ["Thomas Colcombet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colcombet:Thomas", "Marcin Jurdzinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jurdzinski:Marcin", "Ranko Lazic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazic:Ranko", "Sylvain Schmitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmitz:Sylvain"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
