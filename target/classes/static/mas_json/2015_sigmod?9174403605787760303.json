{"title": "DBSCAN Revisited: Mis-Claim, Un-Fixability, and Approximation.", "fields": ["open problem", "dbscan", "optics algorithm", "subclu", "curse of dimensionality"], "abstract": "DBSCAN is a popular method for clustering multi-dimensional objects. Just as notable as the method's vast success is the research community's quest for its efficient computation. The original KDD'96 paper claimed an algorithm with  O ( n  log  n ) running time, where  n  is the number of objects. Unfortunately, this is a mis-claim; and that algorithm actually requires  O ( n  2 ) time. There has been a fix in 2D space, where a genuine  O ( n  log  n )-time algorithm has been found. Looking for a fix for dimensionality  d  \u2265 3 is currently an important open problem.   In this paper, we prove that for  d  \u2265 3, the DBSCAN problem requires \u03a9( n 4/ 3 ) time to solve, unless very significant breakthroughs---ones widely believed to be impossible---could be made in theoretical computer science. This (i) explains why the community's search for fixing the aforementioned mis-claim has been futile for  d  \u2265 3, and (ii) indicates (sadly) that  all  DBSCAN algorithms must be intolerably slow even on moderately large  n  in practice. Surprisingly, we show that the running time can be dramatically brought down to  O ( n ) in expectation  regardless of the dimensionality d , as soon as slight inaccuracy in the clustering results is permitted. We formalize our findings into the new notion of \u03c1- approximate  DBSCAN, which we believe should replace DBSCAN on big data due to the latter's computational intractability.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Junhao Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Junhao", "Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei"], "pages": 12}
