{"title": "Pipelining a triggered processing element.", "fields": ["engineering design process", "pipeline", "design space exploration", "microarchitecture", "fpga prototype"], "abstract": "Programmable spatial architectures composed of ensembles of autonomous fixed-ISA processing elements offer a compelling design point between the flexibility of an FPGA and the compute density of a GPU or shared-memory many-core. The design regularity of spatial architectures demands examination of the processing element microarchitecture early in the design process to optimize overall efficiency.   This paper considers the microarchitectural issues surrounding pipelining a spatial processing element with triggered-instruction control. We propose two new techniques to mitigate pipeline hazards particular to spatial accelerators and non-program-counter architectures, evaluating them using in-vivo performance counters from an FPGA prototype coupled with a rigorous VLSI power and timing estimation methodology. We consider the effect of modern, post-Dennard-scaling CMOS technology on the energy-delay tradeoffs and identify a set of microarchitectures optimal for both high-performance and low-power application settings. Our analysis reveals the effectiveness of our hazard mitigation techniques as well as the range of microarchitectures designers might consider when selecting a processing element for triggered spatial accelerators.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Thomas J.
