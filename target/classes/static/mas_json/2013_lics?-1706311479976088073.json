{"title": "One-Path Reachability Logic.", "fields": ["higher order logic", "well founded semantics", "hoare logic", "operational semantics", "axiomatic semantics"], "abstract": "This paper introduces *(one-path) reach ability logic*, a language-independent proof system for program verification, which takes an operational semantics as axioms and derives *reach ability rules*, which generalize Hoare triples. This system improves on previous work by allowing operational semantics given with *conditional* rewrite rules, which are known to support all major styles of operational semantics. In particular, Kahn's big-step and Plot kin's small-step semantic styles are now supported. The reach ability logic proof system is shown sound (i.e., partially correct) and (relatively) complete. Reach ability logic thus eliminates the need to independently define an axiomatic and an operational semantics for each language, and the non-negligible effort to prove the former sound and complete w.r.t. the latter. The soundness result has also been formalized in Coq, allowing reach ability logic derivations to serve as formal proof certificates that rely only on the operational semantics.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Univ.
