We focus on a content downloading system leveraging both infrastructure-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. With the goal to maximize the system throughput, we formulate a max-flow problem that accounts for several practical aspects, including channel contention and the data transfer paradigm. Through our study, we identify the factors that have the largest impact on the performance and derive guidelines for the design of the vehicular network and of the roadside infrastructure supporting it.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "University of Lyon"], "authors": ["Francesco Malandrino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malandrino:Francesco", "Claudio Casetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casetti:Claudio", "Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiasserini:Carla=Fabiana", "Marco Fiore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiore:Marco"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
