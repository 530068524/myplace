{"title": "A Message-Passing Architecture without Public Ids Using Send-to-Behavior.", "fields": ["message passing", "actor model", "architecture", "language construct", "model of computation"], "abstract": "We explore a novel model of computation based on nodes that have no public addresses (ids). We define nodes as concurrent, message-passing computational entities in an abstract communication medium, similar to the Actor model, but with all public node ids elided. Instead, drawing inspiration from biological systems, we postulate a send-to-behavior language construct to enable anonymous one-way communication. A behavior, defined as a function of input to actions, is also an intensional definition of the subset of nodes that express it. Sending to a behavior is defined to deliver the message to one or more nodes that implement that behavior.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Washington State University", "Washington State University"], "authors": ["Eric Shing-Suan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Eric_Shing=Suan", "Zhe Dang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dang:Zhe"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
