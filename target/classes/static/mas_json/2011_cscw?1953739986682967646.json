Software systems that have been proven to operate efficiently within one culture can fail in the context of the other, especially if they are intended to support rich social interactions. In this paper we demonstrate how a virtual currency system, not unlike ones employed by many US-based websites, evolved within a thriving Chinese online forum into an essential medium for extremely diverse and culturally specific social exchange activities. The social interactions reflect the traditional Chinese idea of guanxi, or interpersonal influence and connectedness, while at the same time incorporating the norms of a new generation of Internet users.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Jiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jiang", "Mark S.
