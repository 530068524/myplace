While a number of studies examine the benefits of such systems, vast majority of these investigations focus on systems where both participants make use of identical devices for communication. We are the first to investigate the opportunities of this technology connecting across different devices. In this work, we contribute an asymmetric synchronous collaboration system that supports a connection between a pro-cam system and multiple commodity mobile devices. We also provide sufficient detail for others to replicate and expand on our work.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "HP Inc."], "authors": ["Baris Unver.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unver:Baris", "Alexander Thayer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thayer:Alexander", "Svetlana Yarosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yarosh:Svetlana"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
