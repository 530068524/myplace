However, image capture systems for autism are typically complex and provide only a top-down, outsider's view. In this work, we assessed the use of cameras worn by children to record the context of their activities and interactions from their perspective. We used a technology probe to explore how this simple, parent-driven system could be designed for families to adopt in their homes. We present the results of a five-week field study with five families. The system helped parents to (1) see the world from their child's eyes, (2) increase their understanding of their child's needs when their child is uncommunicative, and (3) help them encourage their child's social engagement. We discuss how these systems can be designed and used to their full potential.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Gabriela Marcu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marcu:Gabriela", "Anind K.
