This paper presents the design and results of a user study that focused on mixed presence collaboration using large-scale tiled display walls. The research was conducted in order to compare data synchronization schemes for multi-user visualization applications. Our study compared three techniques for sharing data between display spaces with varying constraints and affordances. The results provide empirical evidence that using data sharing techniques with continuous synchronization between the sites lead to improved collaboration for a search and analysis task between remotely located groups. We have also identified aspects of synchronized sessions that result in increased remote collaborator awareness and parallel task coordination. It is believed that this research will lead to better utilization of large-scale tiled display walls for distributed group work.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Argonne National Laboratory", "University of Hawaii at Manoa", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Thomas Marrinan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marrinan:Thomas", "Jason Leigh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leigh:Jason", "Luc Renambot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Renambot:Luc", "Angus Forbes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forbes:Angus", "Steve Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones_0001:Steve", "Andrew E.
