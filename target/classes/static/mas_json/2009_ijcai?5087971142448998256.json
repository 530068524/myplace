{"title": "Incremental Phi*: Incremental Any-Angle Path Planning on Grids.", "fields": ["incremental heuristic search", "search tree", "any angle path planning", "speedup", "order of magnitude"], "abstract": "We study path planning on grids with blocked and unblocked cells. Any-angle path-planning algorithms find short paths fast because they propagate information along grid edges without constraining the resulting paths to grid edges. Incremental pathplanning algorithms solve a series of similar pathplanning problems faster than repeated single-shot searches because they reuse information from the previous search to speed up the next one. In this paper, we combine these ideas by making the anyangle path-planning algorithm Basic Theta* incremental. This is non-trivial because Basic Theta* does not fit the standard assumption that the parent of a vertex in the search tree must also be its neighbor. We present Incremental Phi* and show experimentally that it can speed up Basic Theta* by about one order of magnitude for path planning with the freespace assumption.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Alex Nash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nash:Alex", "Sven Koenig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koenig:Sven", "Maxim Likhachev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Likhachev:Maxim"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 7}
