Our automatic technique is based on Domination Locking, a novel locking protocol. Domination locking is designed specifically for software concurrency control, and in particular is designed for object-oriented software with destructive pointer updates. Domination locking is a strict generalization of existing locking protocols for dynamically changing graphs. We show our technique can successfully add fine-grain locking to libraries where manually performing locking is extremely challenging. We show that automatic fine-grain locking is more efficient than coarse-grain locking, and obtains similar performance to hand-crafted fine-grain locking.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Microsoft", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Guy Golan-Gueta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golan=Gueta:Guy", "Nathan Grasso Bronson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bronson:Nathan_Grasso", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex", "G.
