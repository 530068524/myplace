But the induced stem cells were shown to be distinct from normal embryonic stem cells. However, if cells expressing Nanog and Oct4 are selected, then the reprogrammed fibroblasts are similar to embryonic stem cells in both biological potency and epigenetic state.", "citation": "Citations (3,069)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "University of Edinburgh", "Osaka University", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Loma Linda University", "Technical University of Berlin", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "Rush University Medical Center", "School of Biological Sciences", "Centro de Inves ...
