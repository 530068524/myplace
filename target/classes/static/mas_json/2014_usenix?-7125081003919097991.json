Good DVFS decisions require accurate performance predictions across frequencies. A new hardware structure for measuring leading load cycles was recently proposed and demonstrated promising performance prediction abilities in simulation. This paper proposes a method of leveraging existing hardware performance monitors to emulate a leading loads predictor. Our proposal, LL-MAB, uses existing miss status handling register occupancy information to estimate leading load cycles. We implement and validate LL-MAB on a collection of commercial AMD CPUs. Experiments demonstrate that it can accurately predict performance with an average error of 2.7% using an AMD OpteronTM4386 processor over a 2.2x change in frequency. LL-MAB requires no hardwareor application-specific training, and it is more accurate and requires fewer counters than similar approaches.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Bo Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Bo", "Joseph L.
