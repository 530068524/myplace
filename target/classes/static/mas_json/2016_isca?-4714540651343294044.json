{"title": "Biscuit: A Framework for Near-Data Processing of Big Data Workloads.", "fields": ["code reuse", "data warehouse", "concurrency", "big data", "analytics"], "abstract": "Data-intensive queries are common in business intelligence, data warehousing and analytics applications. Typically, processing a query involves full inspection of large in-storage data sets by CPUs. An intuitive way to speed up such queries is to reduce the volume of data transferred over the storage network to a host system. This can be achieved by filtering out extraneous data within the storage, motivating a form of near-data processing. This work presents Biscuit, a novel near-data processing framework designed for modern solid-state drives. It allows programmers to write a data-intensive application to run on the host system and the storage system in a distributed, yet seamless manner. In order to offer a high-level programming model, Biscuit builds on the concept of data flow. Data processing tasks communicate through typed and data-ordered ports. Biscuit does not distinguish tasks that run on the host system and the storage system. As the result, Biscuit has desirable traits like generality and expressiveness, while promoting code reuse and naturally exposing concurrency. We implement Biscuit on a host system that runs the Linux OS and a high-performance solid-state drive. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and implementation with experimental results. When data filtering is done by hardware in the solid-state drive, the average speed-up obtained for the top five queries of TPC-H is over 15\u00d7.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Boncheol Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Boncheol", "Andre S.
