{"title": "ConfiDNS: Leveraging Scale and History to Detect Compromise.", "fields": ["security policy", "compromise", "resolver", "domain name system", "corruption"], "abstract": "While cooperative DNS resolver systems, such as Co-DNS, have demonstrated improved reliability and performance over standard approaches, their security has been weaker, since any corruption or misbehavior of a single resolver can easily propagate throughout the system.\n\nWe address this weakness in a new system called Confi-DNS, which augments the cooperative lookup process with configurable policies that utilize multi-site agreement and per-site lookup histories. Not only does Confi-DNS provide better security than cooperative approaches, but for up to 99.8% of unique lookups, ConfiDNS exceeds the security of standard DNS resolvers. ConfiDNS provides these benefits while retaining the other benefits of CoDNS, such as incremental deployability, higher reliability, and improved performance, in some cases faster than CoDNS.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Lindsey Poole.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poole:Lindsey", "Vivek S.
