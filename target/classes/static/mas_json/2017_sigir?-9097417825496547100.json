Then, the latter annotate the lower quality examples such that the classifier can be re-trained with more accurate examples. This process can be iterated several times. We tested our approach on two different tasks, Relation Extraction and Community Question Answering, which are also in two different languages, English and Arabic, respectively. Our experimental results show a significant improvement for creating Gold Standard data over distant supervision or just crowdsourcing without worker training. At the same time, our method approach the performance than state-of-the-art methods using expensive Gold Standard for training workers", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Azad Abad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abad:Azad", "Moin Nabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nabi:Moin", "Alessandro Moschitti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moschitti:Alessandro"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
