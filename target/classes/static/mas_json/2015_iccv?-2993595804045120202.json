In this paper, we propose a novel approach to capturing and extracting the matte of a real scene effectively and efficiently. Grown out of the traditional frequency-based signal analysis, our approach can accurately locate contributing sources. By exploiting the recently developed compressive sensing theory, we simplify the data acquisition process of frequency-based environment matting. Incorporating phase information in a frequency signal into data acquisition further accelerates the matte extraction procedure. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, our approach achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real data, while consuming only a fraction of the processing time.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Memorial University of Newfoundland", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yiming Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Yiming", "Minglun Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Minglun", "Yee-Hong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yee=Hong"], "pages": 9}
