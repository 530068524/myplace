We then integrate the Bayesian SVM into a factor model, in which feature learning and nonlinear classifier design are performed jointly; almost all previous work on such discriminative feature learning has assumed a linear classifier. Inference is performed with expectation conditional maximization (ECM) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). An extensive set of experiments demonstrate the utility of using a nonlinear Bayesian SVM within discriminative feature learning and factor modeling, from the standpoints of accuracy and interpretability.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ricardo Henao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henao:Ricardo", "Xin Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan_0002:Xin", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "pages": 9}
