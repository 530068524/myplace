This includes a large number of queries and corresponding relevance judgments from previous benchmarking campaigns, covering a broad range of information needs, ranging from short keyword queries to natural language questions. Further, we present baseline results for this collection with a set of retrieval models based on language modeling and BM25. Finally, we perform an initial analysis to shed light on certain characteristics that make this data set particularly challenging.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of Stavanger", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Krisztian Balog.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balog:Krisztian", "Robert Neumayer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumayer:Robert"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
