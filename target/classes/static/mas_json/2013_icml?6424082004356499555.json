{"title": "Large-Scale Bandit Problems and KWIK Learning.", "fields": ["impossibility", "supervised learning", "pattern recognition", "parametric statistics", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We show that parametric multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems with large state and action spaces can be algorithmically reduced to the supervised learning model known as \"Knows What It Knows\" or KWIK learning. We give matching impossibility results showing that the KWIK-learnability requirement cannot be replaced by weaker supervised learning assumptions. We provide such results in both the standard parametric MAB setting, as well as for a new model in which the action space is finite but growing with time.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Jacob D.
