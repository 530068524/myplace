{"title": "MicroRolls: expanding touch-screen input vocabulary by distinguishing rolls vs. slides of the thumb.", "fields": ["vocabulary", "mobile device", "thumb", "gesture", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "The input vocabulary for touch-screen interaction on handhelds is dramatically limited, especially when the thumb must be used. To enrich that vocabulary we propose to discriminate, among thumb gestures, those we call MicroRolls, characterized by zero tangential velocity of the skin relative to the screen surface. Combining four categories of thumb gestures, Drags, Swipes, Rubbings and MicroRolls, with other classification dimensions, we show that at least 16 elemental gestures can be automatically recognized. We also report the results of two experiments showing that the roll vs. slide distinction facilitates thumb input in a realistic copy and paste task, relative to existing interaction techniques.", "citation": "Citations (130)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Anne Roudaut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roudaut:Anne", "Eric Lecolinet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lecolinet:Eric", "Yves Guiard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guiard:Yves"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
