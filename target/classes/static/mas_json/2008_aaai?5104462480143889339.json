However, the attacker, being an adversarial agent, could reverse engineer the classifier and successfully masquerade as a legitimate user. In this paper, we propose the notion of a Proactive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can counter such attacks by incorporating feedback into the process. A proactive IDS influences the user's actions and observes them in different situations to decide whether the user is an intruder. We present a formal analysis of proactive intrusion detection and extend the adversarial relationship between the IDS and the attacker to present a game theoretic analysis. Finally, we present experimental results on real and synthetic data that confirm the predictions of the analysis.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Aprisma Management Technologies", "Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing", "Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing", "Scientific Systems Company", "Scientific Systems Company"], "authors": ["Benjamin Liebald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liebald:Benjamin", "Dan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Dan", "Neelay Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Neelay", "Vivek Srikumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srikumar:Vivek"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
