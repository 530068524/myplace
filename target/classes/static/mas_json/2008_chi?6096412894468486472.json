{"title": "Explore! possibilities and challenges of mobile learning.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "cooperative inquiry", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "This paper reports the experimental studies we have performed to evaluate Explore!, an m-learning system that supports middle school students during a visit to an archaeological park. It exploits a learning technique called excursion-game, whose aim is to help students to acquire historical notions while playing and to make archaeological visits more effective and exciting. In order to understand the potentials and limitations of Explore!, our studies compare the experience of playing the excursion-game with and without technological support. The design and evaluation of Explore! have provided knowledge on the advantages and pitfalls of m-learning that may be instrumental in informing the current debate on e-learning.", "citation": "Citations (156)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Bari", "University of Manchester", "University of Bari", "University of Bari", "University of Bari"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Maria Francesca Costabile.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costabile:Maria_Francesca", "Antonella De Angeli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angeli:Antonella_De", "Rosa Lanzilotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lanzilotti:Rosa", "Carmelo Ardito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ardito:Carmelo", "Paolo Buono.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buono:Paolo", "Thomas Pederson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pederson:Thomas"], "pages": 10}
