{"title": "Hardness amplification for entangled games via anchoring.", "fields": ["combinatorial game theory", "quantum", "conjecture", "anchoring", "quantum pseudo telepathy"], "abstract": "We study the parallel repetition of one-round games involving players that can use quantum entanglement. A major open question in this area is whether parallel repetition reduces the entangled value of a game at an exponential rate \u00e2   in other words, does an analogue of Raz\u00e2  s parallel repetition theorem hold for games with players sharing quantum entanglement? Previous results only apply to special classes of games.   We introduce a class of games we call  anchored . We then introduce a simple transformation on games called  anchoring , inspired in part by the Feige-Kilian transformation, that turns  any  (multiplayer) game into an anchored game. Unlike the Feige-Kilian transformation, our anchoring transformation is completeness preserving.   We prove an exponential-decay parallel repetition theorem for anchored games that involve any number of entangled players. We also prove a threshold version of our parallel repetition theorem for anchored games.   Together, our parallel repetition theorems and anchoring transformation provide the first hardness amplification techniques for general entangled games. We give an application to the games version of the Quantum PCP Conjecture.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Mohammad Bavarian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bavarian:Mohammad", "Thomas Vidick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidick:Thomas", "Henry Yuen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuen:Henry"], "pages": 14}
