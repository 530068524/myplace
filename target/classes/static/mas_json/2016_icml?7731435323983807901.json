This setting has been motivated by problems arising in cognitive radio networks, and is especially challenging under the realistic assumption that communication between players is limited. We provide a communication-free algorithm (Musical Chairs) which attains constant regret with high probability, as well as a sublinear-regret, communication-free algorithm (Dynamic Musical Chairs) for the more difficult setting of players dynamically entering and leaving throughout the game. Moreover, both algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the number of players. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first communication-free algorithms with these types of formal guarantees.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jonathan Rosenski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenski:Jonathan", "Ohad Shamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamir:Ohad", "Liran Szlak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szlak:Liran"], "pages": 9}
