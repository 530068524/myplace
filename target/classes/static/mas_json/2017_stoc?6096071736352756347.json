Equivalently, our algorithm takes the description of a subspace \u00e2   F  n  2   (where F can be either the real or complex field) and distinguishes between the case that contains a rank one matrix, and the case that every rank one matrix is at least N  far (in \u00e2   2  distance) from .   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first improvement over the brute-force exp( n )-time algorithm for this problem. Our algorithm is based on the  sum-of-squares  hierarchy and its analysis is inspired by Lovett\u00e2  s proof (STOC \u00e2  14, JACM \u00e2  16) that the communication complexity of every rank- n  Boolean matrix is bounded by \ufffd (\u00e2   n ).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Princeton University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Boaz Barak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barak:Boaz", "Pravesh K.
