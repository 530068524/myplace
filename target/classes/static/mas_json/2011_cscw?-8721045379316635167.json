In an online experiment, we varied content and presentation of photos shared by a hypothetical team spanning two locations. We found similarity in shared photo content promoted pro-social behaviors towards team members regardless of location. We also found that the way the photos were organized moderated the impact of photo similarity, with diverging effects towards local versus distant team members. Our results indicate that photo sharing can promote positive behavior towards distant others under certain conditions. These results can inform the nature of photo sharing for team building.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Jennifer Marlow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marlow:Jennifer", "Laura Dabbish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dabbish:Laura"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
