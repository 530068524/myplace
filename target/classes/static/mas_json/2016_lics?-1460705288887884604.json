This paper solves a three-decade open problem: are there efficient canonical proof nets for MALL (unit-free multiplicative-additive linear logic)?   Honouring MLL and ALL canonicity, in which all commutations are strictly local proof-tree rewrites, we define local canonicity for MALL: invariance under local rule commutation. We present new proof nets for MALL, called conflict nets, which are both efficient and locally canonical.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Bath"], "authors": ["Dominic J.
