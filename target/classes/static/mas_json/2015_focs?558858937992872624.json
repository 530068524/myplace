Bova, Ganian and Szeider [CSL-LICS'14] initiated the study of the complexity of FO model checking on partially ordered sets (posets). Bova, Ganian and Szeider showed that model checking existential FO logic is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on posets of bounded width, where the width of a poset is the size of the largest antichain in the poset. The existence of an FPT algorithm for general FO model checking on posets of bounded width, however, remained open. We resolve this question in the positive by giving an algorithm that takes as its input an n-element poset P of width w and an FO logic formula phi, and determines whether phi holds on P in time f(a#x03C6;, w).n2", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Bergen", "University of Bergen", "University of Bergen", "Masaryk University", "Masaryk University"], "authors": ["Jakub Gajarsk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gajarsk=yacute=:Jakub", "Petr Hlinen\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hlinen=yacute=:Petr", "Daniel Lokshtanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lokshtanov:Daniel", "Jan Obdrz\u00e1lek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Obdrz=aacute=lek:Jan", "Sebastian Ordyniak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ordyniak:Sebastian", "M.
