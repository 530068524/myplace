An image-text multimodal neural language model can be used to retrieve images given complex sentence queries, retrieve phrase descriptions given image queries, as well as generate text conditioned on images. We show that in the case of image-text modelling we can jointly learn word representations and image features by training our models together with a convolutional network. Unlike many of the existing methods, our approach can generate sentence descriptions for images without the use of templates, structured prediction, and/or syntactic trees. While we focus on imagetext modelling, our algorithms can be easily applied to other modalities such as audio.", "citation": "Citations (721)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Canadian Institute for Advanced Research", "University of Toronto", "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research", "University of Toronto", "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ryan Kiros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiros:Ryan", "Ruslan Salakhutdinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salakhutdinov:Ruslan", "Richard S.
