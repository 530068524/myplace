{"title": "The Hard Problems Are Almost Everywhere For Random CNF-XOR Formulas.", "fields": ["exponential growth", "almost everywhere", "boolean satisfiability problem", "combinatorics", "sampling"], "abstract": "Recent universal-hashing based approaches to sampling and counting crucially depend on the runtime performance of SAT solvers on formulas expressed as the conjunction of both CNF constraints and variable-width XOR constraints (known as CNF-XOR formulas). In this paper, we present the first study of the runtime behavior of SAT solvers equipped with XOR-reasoning techniques on random CNF-XOR formulas. We empirically demonstrate that a state-of-the-art SAT solver scales exponentially on random CNF-XOR formulas across a wide range of XOR-clause densities, peaking around the empirical phase-transition location. On the theoretical front, we prove that the solution space of a random CNF-XOR formula 'shatters' at all nonzero XOR-clause densities into well-separated components, similar to the behavior seen in random CNF formulas known to be difficult for many SAT algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Rice University", "National University of Singapore", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Jeffrey M.
