{"title": "Fixing a Tournament.", "fields": ["existential quantification", "graph factorization", "bracket", "tournament", "string graph"], "abstract": "We consider a very natural problem concerned with game manipulation. Let G be a directed graph where the nodes represent players of a game, and an edge from u to v means that u can beat v in the game. (If an edge (u,v) is not present, one cannot match u and v.) Given G and a \"favorite\" node A, is it possible to set up the bracket of a balanced single-elimination tournament so that A is guaranteed to win, if matches occur as predicted by G? We show that the problem is NP-complete for general graphs. For the case when G is a tournament graph we give several interesting conditions on the desired winner A for which there exists a balanced single-elimination tournament which A wins, and it can be found in polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Virginia Vassilevska Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Virginia_Vassilevska"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
