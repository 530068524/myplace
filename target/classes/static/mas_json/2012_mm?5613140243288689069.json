In this paper, we attack a novel problem, the \"multi-keyphrase problem\", to address this goal. We hypothesize that image contents can be described with multi-keyphrases, and that a natural sentence can be generated by connecting multi-keyphrases with an experimental grammar model. Existing methods require semantic knowledge such as labels of an object, action, or scene. Using these methods, we must strive to prepare a highly organized dataset. Therefore, we propose a novel online learning method for multi-keyphrase estimation. The proposed framework, although simple and scalable, can generate sentences from images with no semantic knowledge. Moreover, the proposed method for multi-keyphrase estimation is applicable to image annotation, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our experiment using only images and texts demonstrates that the proposed framework is useful for sentence generation from images.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Yoshitaka Ushiku.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ushiku:Yoshitaka", "Tatsuya Harada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harada:Tatsuya", "Yasuo Kuniyoshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuniyoshi:Yasuo"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
