The model extends Hidden Semi-Markov chain models by using factored output nodes and special structures for its conditional probability distributions. It relies on morpho-syntactic and lexical source-side information (part-of-speech, morphological segmentation) while learning a morpheme segmentation over the target language. Our model outperforms a competitive word alignment system in alignment quality. Used in a monolingual morphological segmentation setting it substantially improves accuracy over previous state-of-the-art models on three Arabic and Hebrew datasets.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhuowei Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Zhuowei", "Benny Kimelfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimelfeld:Benny", "Yunyao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Yunyao"], "pages": 10}
