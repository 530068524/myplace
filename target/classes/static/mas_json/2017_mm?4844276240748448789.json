However, it is challenging to achieve seamless and high quality video while saving battery energy and LTE data usage to prolong the usage time of a smartphone. In this paper, we propose REQUEST, a video chunk request policy for Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) in a smartphone, which can utilize both LTE and Wi-Fi. REQUEST enables seamless DASH video streaming with near optimal video quality under given budgets of battery energy and LTE data usage. Through extensive simulation and measurement in a real environment, we demonstrate that REQUEST significantly outperforms other existing schemes in terms of average video bitrate, rebuffering, and resource waste.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Chung-Ang University", "University of Helsinki", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Jonghoe Koo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koo:Jonghoe", "Juheon Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Juheon", "Joongheon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Joongheon", "Mohammad Ashraful Hoque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoque:Mohammad_Ashraful", "Sunghyun Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Sunghyun"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
