{"title": "Coordination-Artifacts Suiting: When Plans are in the Midst of Ordering Systems.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "computer supported cooperative work", "computer science"], "abstract": "This paper addresses the received understanding of the status of plans in cooperative work-that is, artefacts that anticipate future ways of performing activities, to challenge the received understanding of the plan's capacity to anticipate interdependencies as an immutable feature of plans. We propose conceptualizing the plan's capacity to anticipate interdependencies at work as an emergent, distributed and artifact-mediated activity that might be uncovered studying plans, planning and the plans application as work objects and activities occurring within a multiplicity of coordinative artifacts and protocols. This way we can expand our knowledge on how the plans anticipation is maintained in changing environments to support work coordination and we might support designers of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) -- efforts for the design of CSCW systems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Ilaria Redaelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Redaelli:Ilaria", "Antonella Carassa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carassa:Antonella"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 14}
