Aiming to effectively monitor various aspects of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) from diversely expressed social medical posts, we propose a multi-task neural network framework that learns several tasks associated with ADR monitoring with different levels of supervisions collectively. Besides being able to correctly classify ADR posts and accurately extract ADR mentions from online posts, the proposed framework is also able to further understand reasons for which the drug is being taken, known as \u2018indications\u2019, from the given social media post. A coverage-based attention mechanism is adopted in our framework to help the model properly identify \u2018phrasal\u2019 ADRs and Indications that are attentive to multiple words in a post. Our framework is applicable in situations where limited parallel data for different pharmacovigilance tasks are available. We evaluate the proposed framework on real-world Twitter datasets, where the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives of each individual task consistently.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Shaika Chowdhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chowdhury:Shaika", "Chenwei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chenwei", "Philip S.
