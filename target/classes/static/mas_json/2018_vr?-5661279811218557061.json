{"title": "In Limbo: The Effect of Gradual Visual Transition Between Real and Virtual on Virtual Body Ownership Illusion and Presence.", "fields": ["optical illusion", "virtual reality", "stereo camera", "illusion", "virtual machine"], "abstract": "We present a study of the relative effects of gradual versus instantaneous transition between one's own body and a virtual surrogate body, and between one's real-world environment and a virtual environment. The approach uses a stereo camera attached to an HMD to provide the illusions of virtual body ownership and spatial presence in VR. We conducted the study in a static environment which is similar to the traditional rubber hand experiment platform. Since our transition method is a blending scheme between real and virtual contexts, our study investigates the direct use of real-world information during the transition to increase the dominant visual illusion in a virtual space. We also investigate the use of a conceptual stage, called Limbo, which is a transition phase that evokes anticipation of the virtual world, providing a psychological link between the real and virtual before we enter a totally virtual space. Our study of the transition effect shows that the Limbo state has a significant influence in one's illusions of virtual body ownership (VBOI) and presence.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "authors": ["Sungchul Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Sungchul", "Pamela J.
