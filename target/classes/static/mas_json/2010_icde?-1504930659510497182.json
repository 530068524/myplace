The approaches adopted in the literature generate either overwhelmingly large results or fragmentary results, both of which may cause the ranking schemes to be ineffective. Intuitively, each query has a search target and each result should contain exactly one instance of the search target along with its evidence. We developed TargetSearch which composes atomic and intact query results driven by users' search targets.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Ziyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ziyang", "Yichuan Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Yichuan", "Yi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Yi"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
