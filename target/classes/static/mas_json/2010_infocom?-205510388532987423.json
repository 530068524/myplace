In particular, we characterize broadcast capacity and latency of a mobile network, subject to the condition that the stationary node spatial distribution generated by the mobility model is uniform. We first study the intrinsic properties of broadcasting, and present a broadcasting scheme that simultaneously achieves asymptotically optimal broadcast capacity and latency, subject to a weak upper bound on the maximum node velocity. We then investigate the broadcasting problem when the burden related to selecting relay nodes is taken into account, and present a combined distributed leader election and broadcasting scheme achieving a broadcast capacity and latency which is within a poly-logarithmic factor from optimal.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Research Council", "National Research Council", "Istituto di Inf ...
