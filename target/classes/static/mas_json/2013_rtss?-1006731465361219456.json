We propose an analysis computing response time distributions of the tasks scheduled on one processor under a task-level fixed-priority preemptive scheduling policy. The complexity of our method is analyzed and it is improved by re-sampling techniques on worst-case execution time distributions and/or minimal inter-arrival time distributions. The improvements are shown through experimental results. Also, experiments are conducted in order to investigate the improvement obtained by using a probabilistic model in terms of precision and schedulability gained as opposed to a deterministic worst-case reasoning.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["LORIA, Univ. de ... s-Nancy, France", "LORIA, Vandoeuv ... s-Nancy, France"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Dorin Maxim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maxim:Dorin", "Liliana Cucu-Grosjean.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cucu=Grosjean:Liliana"], "pages": 12}
