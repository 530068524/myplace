{"title": "\"Stray\": a new multimedia music composition using the andantephone.", "fields": ["chord", "musical composition", "musical notation", "input device", "tangible user interface"], "abstract": "The andantephone is an instrument that allows a performed to physically step through a piece of music by walking. Each note or chord of the piece is assigned to one footstep, so expressively varying velocity varies the tempo in turn.   A new, more flexible design of andantephone was created for use in a new composition, using an array of tiles sensitive to geophonic seismic waves from footsteps. This user-interface was combined with a real-time frequency shifterbank which shifted the geophonic vibrations of human feet to the frequencies of the musical notes and chords of the composition. Matrix multiplication in the shifterbank allowed chords from various tiles to be expressively layered together depending on the geophonic sounds coming from any number of tiles being stepped on at a time. Moreover, the new shifterbank adjusted its tuning dynamically (according to the composition) as the performer cycled around the track, creating a responsive multitouch landscape that unraveled around the track ahead of and behind the performer. The shifterbank output was also interfaced to a pipe organ, via FLUIDI, using the organ as an additional sounding device.   A new andantephone tile configuration led to advantages over previous configurations, including less off-track radial acceleration required to change tempo, and the ability to multiplex between different types of vertex turns, which was found to improve spatial orientation when performing.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Ryan E.
