We explore the idea of using sketch data structures for this problem, and show that the tug-of-war sketch gives an asymptotically optimal solution. The optimality of our algorithms are proved using communication complexity lower bound techniques. We then propose a novel enhancement of the tug-of-war sketch that greatly reduces the communication overhead for realistic error rates. Our theoretical analysis and assertions are supported by extensive experimental evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Denison University", "University of Toronto", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Nan Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Nan", "Ashwin Lall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lall:Ashwin", "Baochun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baochun", "Jun (Jim) Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jun_=Jim="], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
