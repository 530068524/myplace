The best secret sharing schemes for general monotone functions have shares of size \\(\\varTheta (2^n)\\). It has long been conjectured that one cannot do much better than \\(2^{\\varOmega (n)}\\) share size, and indeed, such a lower bound is known for the restricted class of linear secret-sharing schemes.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Tianren Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tianren", "Vinod Vaikuntanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaikuntanathan:Vinod", "Hoeteck Wee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wee:Hoeteck"], "pages": 30}
