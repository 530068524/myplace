Findings demonstrate that communication style is significantly affected by interaction techniques. The direct touch technique stimulated conversations based around the topic and pedagogical method. The pantograph technique promoted playfulness and had a higher number of directive utterances between participants, with fewer task-based, group-oriented utterances. The non-digital table promoted reflective forms of task-orientated utterance, encouraged group communication and fostered more equitable participation between members. The findings provide insights into the design of interactive tables to support particular forms of social interaction.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "Microsoft", "Brunel University London", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Izdihar Jamil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jamil:Izdihar", "Kenton O'Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Hara:Kenton", "Mark J.
