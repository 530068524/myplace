Today's networks can only forward traffic based on the destination IP prefix, by selecting among routes offered by their immediate neighbors. We believe Software Defined Networking (SDN) could revolutionize wide-area traffic delivery, by offering direct control over packet-processing rules that match on multiple header fields and perform a variety of actions. Internet exchange points (IXPs) are a compelling place to start, given their central role in interconnecting many networks and their growing importance in bringing popular content closer to end users.   To realize a Software Defined IXP (an \"SDX\"), we must create compelling applications, such as \"application-specific peering\"---where two networks peer only for (say) streaming video traffic. We also need new programming abstractions that allow participating networks to create and run these applications and a runtime that both behaves correctly when interacting with BGP and ensures that applications do not interfere with each other. Finally, we must ensure that the system scales, both in rule-table size and computational overhead. In this paper, we tackle these challenges and demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our solutions through controlled and in-the-wild experiments. Our experiments demonstrate that our SDX implementation can implement representative policies for hundreds of participants who advertise full routing tables while achieving sub-second convergence in response to configuration changes and routing updates.", "citation": "Citations (273)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Arpit Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Arpit", "Laurent Vanbever.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanbever:Laurent", "Muhammad Shahbaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shahbaz:Muhammad", "Sean P.
