Image compositing in parallel scientific visualization is a reduction operation where this is the case. We present a new algorithm called  Radix-k  that in many cases performs better than existing compositing algorithms. It does so through a set of configurable parameters, the radices, that determine the number of communication partners in each message round. The algorithm embodies and unifies binary swap and direct-send, two of the best-known compositing methods, and enables numerous other configurations through appropriate choices of radices. While the algorithm is not tied to a particular computing architecture or network topology, the selection of radices allows Radix-k to take advantage of new supercomputer interconnect features such as multiporting. We show scalability across image size and system size, including both powers of two and nonpowers-of-two process counts.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Ohio State University", "Argonne National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Tom Peterka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peterka:Tom", "David Goodell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goodell:David", "Robert B.
