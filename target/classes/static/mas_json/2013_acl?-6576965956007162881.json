A recognition algorithm due to Lautemann is known to be polynomial-time for graphs that are connected and of bounded degree. We present a more precise characterization of the algorithm\u2019s complexity, an optimization analogous to binarization of contextfree grammars, and some important implementation details, resulting in an algorithm that is practical for natural-language applications. The algorithm is part of Bolinas, a new software toolkit for HRG processing.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Information Sciences Institute", "University of Cambridge", "Columbia University", "University of Oxford", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["David Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang_0001:David", "Jacob Andreas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andreas:Jacob", "Daniel Bauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauer:Daniel", "Karl Moritz Hermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hermann:Karl_Moritz", "Bevan K.
