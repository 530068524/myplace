{"title": "CODA: Toward Automatically Identifying and Scheduling Coflows in the Dark.", "fields": ["scheduling", "real time computing", "cluster analysis", "testbed", "coda"], "abstract": "Leveraging application-level requirements using coflows has recently been shown to improve application-level communication performance in data-parallel clusters. However, existing coflow-based solutions rely on modifying applications to extract coflows, making them inapplicable to many practical scenarios.   In this paper, we present CODA, a first attempt at automatically identifying and scheduling coflows without any application-level modifications. We employ an incremental clustering algorithm to perform fast, application-transparent coflow identification and complement it by proposing an error-tolerant coflow scheduler to mitigate occasional identification errors. Testbed experiments and large-scale simulations with production workloads show that CODA can identify coflows with over 90% accuracy, and its scheduler is robust to inaccuracies, enabling communication stages to complete 2.4x (5.1x) faster on average (95-th percentile) compared to per-flow mechanisms. Overall, CODA's performance is comparable to that of solutions requiring application modifications.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Hong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hong", "Li Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Li", "Bairen Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Bairen", "Kai Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0005:Kai", "Mosharaf Chowdhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chowdhury:Mosharaf", "Yanhui Geng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geng:Yanhui"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
