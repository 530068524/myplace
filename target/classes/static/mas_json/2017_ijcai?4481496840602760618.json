{"title": "KSP: A Resolution-based Prover for Multimodal K, Abridged Report.", "fields": ["multimodal logic", "gas meter prover", "machine learning", "speech recognition", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We briefly describe an implementation of a hyperresolution-based calculus for the propositional basic multimodal logic, K n . The prover, KSP, which allows for both local and global reasoning, is designed to support experimentation with different combinations of refinements for its basic calculus. We present an experimental evaluation that compares K S P with a range of existing reasoners for K n .", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Bras\u00edlia", "University of Liverpool", "University of Liverpool"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Cl\u00e1udia Nalon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nalon:Cl=aacute=udia", "Ullrich Hustadt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hustadt:Ullrich", "Clare Dixon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dixon:Clare"], "pages": 5}
