{"title": "Participatory Design of Therapeutic Video Games for Young People with Neurological Vision Impairment.", "fields": ["activities of daily living", "special needs", "iterative design", "visual search", "participatory design"], "abstract": "Neurological Vision Impairment (NVI) detrimentally impacts upon quality of life, as daily activities such as reading and crossing the road often become significantly impaired. Therapy strategies for NVI based on visual scanning of on-screen stimuli have recently been demonstrated as effective at improving functional vision. However, these strategies are repetitive, monotonous and unsuitable for use with children and young adults. This project explores the design of a game-based therapy programme that aims to support participant engagement and adherence. We first outline requirements for this software, before reporting on the iterative design process undertaken in collaboration with young people, therapists and teachers at a centre for vision impairment. Our work provides insights into the participatory design of games in collaboration with young people with special needs, and reflects upon the tension of balancing game challenge, therapy goals, and accessibility. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of games to empower special populations by providing a medium through which to communicate the subjective experience of specific impairments.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Lincoln", "University of Lincoln", "University of Lincoln", "University of Lincoln", "WESC Foundation ...
