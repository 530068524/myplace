{"title": "Adaptively Learning the Crowd Kernel.", "fields": ["embedding", "euclidean space", "similarity matrix", "vowel", "adaptive learning"], "abstract": "We introduce an algorithm that, given n objects, learns a similarity matrix over all n2 pairs, from crowdsourced data alone. The algorithm samples responses to adaptively chosen triplet-based relative-similarity queries. Each query has the form \"is object a more similar to b or to c?\" and is chosen to be maximally informative given the preceding responses. The output is an embedding of the objects into Euclidean space (like MDS); we refer to this as the \"crowd kernel.\" SVMs reveal that the crowd kernel captures prominent and subtle features across a number of domains, such as \"is striped\" among neckties and \"vowel vs. consonant\" among letters.", "citation": "Citations (173)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Omer Tamuz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamuz:Omer", "Ce Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ce", "Serge J.
