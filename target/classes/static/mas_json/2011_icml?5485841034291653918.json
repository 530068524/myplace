It is based on the use of conical combinations of data-based parameterized kernels and on a new stochastic convex optimization procedure of which we establish convergence guarantees. The overall learning procedure has the nice properties that a) the learned conical combination is automatically designed to perform the regression task at hand and b) the updates implicated by the optimization procedure are quite inexpensive. In order to shed light on the appositeness of our learning strategy, we present empirical results from experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Aix-Marseille University", "Aix-Marseille University", "Aix-Marseille University", "Aix-Marseille University", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Pierre Machart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Machart:Pierre", "Thomas Peel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peel:Thomas", "Sandrine Anthoine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anthoine:Sandrine", "Liva Ralaivola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ralaivola:Liva", "Herv\u00e9 Glotin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glotin:Herv=eacute="], "pages": 8}
