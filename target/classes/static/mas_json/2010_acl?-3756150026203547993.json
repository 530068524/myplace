First, large amounts of query-correction pairs are derived by analyzing users' query reformulation behavior encoded in the clickthrough data. Then, a phrase-based error model that accounts for the transformation probability between multi-term phrases is trained and integrated into a query speller system. Experiments are carried out on a human-labeled data set. Results show that the system using the phrase-based error model outperforms significantly its baseline systems.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xu Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Xu", "Jianfeng Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jianfeng", "Daniel Micol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micol:Daniel", "Chris Quirk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quirk:Chris"], "pages": 9}
