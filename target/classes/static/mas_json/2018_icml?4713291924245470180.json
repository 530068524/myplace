We develop the notion of measure-theoretic Bayesian networks (MTBNs) and use it to provide more general semantics for PPLs with arbitrarily many random variables defined over arbitrary measure spaces. We develop two new general sampling algorithms that are provably correct under the MTBN framework: the lexicographic likelihood weighting (LLW) for general MTBNs and the lexicographic particle filter (LPF), a specialized algorithm for state-space models. We further integrate MTBNs into a widely used PPL system, BLOG, and verify the effectiveness of the new inference algorithms through representative examples.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of California, Berkeley", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Yi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yi", "Siddharth Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Siddharth", "Nicholas Hay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hay:Nicholas", "Simon Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Simon", "Stuart J.
