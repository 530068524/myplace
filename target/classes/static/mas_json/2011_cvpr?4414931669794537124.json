We find that in these scenes, linear appearance variations have a direct relationship to scene motions. We show how to interpret appearance variations captured through a PCA decomposition of the image set as a scene-specific non-parametric motion basis. We propose fast, robust tools for dense flow estimates that are effective in scenes with small motions and potentially large image noise. We show example results in a variety of applications, including motion segmentation and long-term point tracking.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "University of Kentucky", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michael Dixon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dixon:Michael", "Austin Abrams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abrams:Austin", "Nathan Jacobs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobs:Nathan", "Robert Pless.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pless:Robert"], "pages": 8}
