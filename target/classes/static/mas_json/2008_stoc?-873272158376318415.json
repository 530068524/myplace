This is one of the first k-server algorithms with competitive ratio poly-logarithmic in the natural problem parameters, and represents substantial progress on the randomized k-server conjecture. Extending the algorithm to trees of higher degree would give a competitive ratio of O(log 2  Delta log n) for the k-server problem on general metrics with n points and diameter Delta.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Aaron Cote.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cote:Aaron", "Adam Meyerson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyerson:Adam", "Laura J.
