{"title": "Handling Uncertainty in Geo-Spatial Data.", "fields": ["sensitivity analysis", "open research", "measurement uncertainty", "data modeling", "uncertainty analysis"], "abstract": "An inherent challenge arising in any dataset containing information of space and/or time is uncertainty due to various sources of imprecision. Integrating the impact of the uncertainty is a paramount when estimating the reliability (confidence) of any query result from the underlying input data. To deal with uncertainty, solutions have been proposed independently in the geo-science and the data-science research community. This interdisciplinary tutorial bridges the gap between the two communities by providing a comprehensive overview of the different challenges involved in dealing with uncertain geo-spatial data, by surveying solutions from both research communities, and by identifying similarities, synergies and open research problems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["George Mason University", "George Mason University", "George Mason University", "George Mason University", "Electrical Engi ... omputer Science"], "authors": ["Andreas Z\u00fcfle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Z=uuml=fle:Andreas", "Goce Trajcevski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trajcevski:Goce", "Dieter Pfoser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfoser:Dieter", "Matthias Renz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Renz:Matthias", "Matthew T.
