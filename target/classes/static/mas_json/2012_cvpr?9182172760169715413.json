When there are prominent line structures in the image, image resizing methods without explicitly taking these properties into account could produce line structure distortions in their results. Since the human visual system is very sensitive to line structures, such distortions often become noticeable and disturbing. Our method couples mesh deformations for image resizing with similarity transforms for line features. Mesh deformations are used to control content preservation while similarity transforms are analyzed in the Hough space to maintain line structure properties. Our method strikes a good balance between preserving content and maintaining line structure properties. Experiments show the proposed method often outperforms methods without taking line structures into account, especially for scenes with prominent line structures.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Che-Han Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Che=Han", "Yung-Yu Chuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuang:Yung=Yu"], "pages": 8}
