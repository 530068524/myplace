{"title": "Nonparametric Max-Margin Matrix Factorization for Collaborative Prediction.", "fields": ["data set", "movielens", "matrix decomposition", "nonparametric statistics", "probabilistic logic"], "abstract": "We present a probabilistic formulation of max-margin matrix factorization and build accordingly a nonparametric Bayesian model which automatically resolves the unknown number of latent factors. Our work demonstrates a successful example that integrates Bayesian nonparametrics and max-margin learning, which are conventionally two separate paradigms and enjoy complementary advantages. We develop an efficient variational algorithm for posterior inference, and our extensive empirical studies on large-scale MovieLens and EachMovie data sets appear to justify the aforementioned dual advantages.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Minjie Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Minjie", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Bo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0010:Bo"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
