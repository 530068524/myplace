{"title": "On Exploring Semantic Meanings of Links for Embedding Social Networks.", "fields": ["visualization", "feature learning", "social network", "embedding", "encoding"], "abstract": "There are increasing interests in learning low-dimensional and dense node representations from the network structure which is usually high-dimensional and sparse. However, most existing methods equally treat all social links which may have different semantic meanings. Links have different semantic meanings because the similarities between two nodes can be different, e.g., two nodes share common neighbors and two nodes share similar interests which are demonstrated in node-generated content. In this paper, the former type of links is referred to as structure-close links while the latter type is referred to as content-close links. These two types of links naturally indicate there are two types of characteristics that nodes expose in a social network. Hence, we propose to learn two representations for each node, and render each representation responsible for encoding the corresponding type of links, which is achieved by jointly embedding the network structure and inferring the type of each link. In the experiments, the proposed method is demonstrated to be more effective than five recent mehtods on four social networks through applications including visualization, link prediction and multi-label classification.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Facebook", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Linchuan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Linchuan", "Xiaokai Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Xiaokai", "Jiannong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Jiannong", "Philip S.
