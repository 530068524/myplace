{"title": "The Complexity of Learning Separable ceteris paribus Preferences.", "fields": ["separable space", "ceteris paribus", "preference learning", "preference relation", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We address the problem of learning preference relations on multi-attribute (or combinatorial) domains. We do so by making a very simple hypothesis about the dependence structure between attributes that the preference relation enjoys, namely separability (no preferential dependencies between attributes). Given a set of examples consisting of comparisons between alternatives, we want to output a separable CP-net, consisting of local preferences on each of the attributes, that fits the examples. We consider three forms of compatibility between a CP-net and a set of examples, and for each of them we give useful characterizations as well as complexity results.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University", "University of Toulouse"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mengin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mengin:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
