Water drops in microgravity space burst sequentially, imitating the Japanese seasonal fireworks tradition. My aim is to let the audience enjoy the contrast between the silence of floating water drops and the active motion of the water burst.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Japan"], "authors": ["Masahiro Katsuta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katsuta:Masahiro"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
