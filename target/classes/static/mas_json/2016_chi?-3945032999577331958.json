{"title": "Using an International Gaming Tournament to Study Individual Differences in MOBA Expertise and Cognitive Skills.", "fields": ["working memory", "cognitive skill", "tournament", "elementary cognitive task", "long term memory"], "abstract": "In this study we evaluated a novel approach for examining the link between gaming expertise and cognitive skills, and the value of recruiting and running participants at a MOBA gaming tournament. Participants completed a set of cognitive tasks that measured spatial working and long term (location) memory, basic cognitive processing, and gaming experience. Comparable reliability on the working memory task and results in line with previous research on the location memory task indicated the data collected was valid and reliable. We observed a significant relation between gaming experience and response time on the location memory task. We discuss that conducting gaming research at a tournament is a valid way of collecting data for a gaming expertise study while providing a range of gaming expertise that may not be available when recruiting at college campuses. Furthermore, our results extend previous gaming research that suggests that individual differences in gaming experience are correlated with the speed of recalling spatial information from long term memory.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["foundry10, Seattle, WA, USA", "foundry10, Seattle, WA, USA", "foundry10, Seattle, WA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Justin W.
