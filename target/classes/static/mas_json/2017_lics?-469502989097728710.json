This technique is applied on many models like Kripke structures, labeled graphs, labeled transition systems or even word and tree automata. Let (Q,\u2192) be a given transition system and \u211b init  be an initial preorder over Q. Until now, algorithms to compute \u211b sim , the coarsest simulation included in \u211b init , are either memory efficient or time efficient but not both. In this paper we propose the foundation for a series of efficient simulation algorithms with the introduction of the notion of maximal transitions and the notion of stability of a preorder with respect to a coarser one. As an illustration we solve an open problem by providing the first algorithm with the best published time complexity, O(|P sim |.|\u2192|), and a bit space complexity in O(|P sim | 2 .log(|P sim |)+|Q|.log(|Q|)), with P sim  the partition induced by \u211b sim .", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["FEMTO-ST"], "authors": ["G\u00e9rard C\u00e9c\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/C=eacute=c=eacute=:G=eacute=rard"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
