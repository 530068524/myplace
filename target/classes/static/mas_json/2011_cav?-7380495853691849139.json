We propose a state/event-based framework as well as an on-the-fly model checking algorithm to verify LTL properties under universally quantified parametric fairness assumptions, specified by generalized strong/weak fairness formulas. It enables verification of temporal properties under fairness conditions associated to dynamic entities such as new process creations. We have implemented our algorithm within the Maude system.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Kyungmin Bae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bae:Kyungmin", "Jos\u00e9 Meseguer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meseguer:Jos=eacute="], "pages": 17}
