{"title": "Authenticated join processing in outsourced databases.", "fields": ["hash join", "recursive join", "block nested loop", "joins", "sort merge join"], "abstract": "Database outsourcing requires that a query server constructs a proof of result correctness, which can be verified by the client using the data owner's signature. Previous authentication techniques deal with range queries on a single relation using an  authenticated data structure  (ADS). On the other hand, authenticated join processing is inherently more complex than ranges since only the base relations (but not their combination) are signed by the owner. In this paper, we present three novel join algorithms depending on the ADS availability: (i)  Authenticated Indexed Sort Merge Join  (AISM), which utilizes a single ADS on the join attribute, (ii)  Authenticated Index Merge Join  (AIM) that requires an ADS (on the join attribute) for both relations, and (iii)  Authenticated Sort Merge Join  (ASM), which does not rely on any ADS. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform two benchmark algorithms, often by several orders of magnitude, on all performance metrics, and effectively shift the workload to the outsourcing service. Finally, we extend our techniques to complex queries that combine multi-way joins with selections and projections.", "citation": "Citations (117)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yin", "Dimitris Papadias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadias:Dimitris", "Stavros Papadopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadopoulos_0001:Stavros", "Panos Kalnis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalnis:Panos"], "pages": 14}
