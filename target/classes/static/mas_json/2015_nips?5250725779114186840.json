{"title": "Revenue Optimization against Strategic Buyers.", "fields": ["common value auction", "finite set", "valuation", "regret", "revenue"], "abstract": "We present a revenue optimization algorithm for posted-price auctions when facing a buyer with random valuations who seeks to optimize his \u03b3-discounted surplus. In order to analyze this problem we introduce the notion of e-strategic buyer, a more natural notion of strategic behavior than what has been considered in the past. We improve upon the previous state-of-the-art and achieve an optimal regret bound in O(log T + 1/log(1/\u03b3)) when the seller selects prices from a finite set and provide a regret bound in O(\u221aT + T1/4/ log(1/\u03b3)) when the prices offered are selected out of the interval [0,1].", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Google"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Mehryar Mohri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohri:Mehryar", "Andres Mu\u00f1oz Medina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medina:Andres_Mu=ntilde=oz"], "pages": 9}
