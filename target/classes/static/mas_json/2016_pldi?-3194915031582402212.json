{"title": "Automatically learning shape specifications.", "fields": ["programmer", "complex data type", "correctness", "predicate", "shape analysis"], "abstract": "This paper presents a novel automated procedure for discovering expressive shape specifications for sophisticated functional data structures. Our approach extracts potential shape predicates based on the definition of constructors of arbitrary user-defined inductive data types, and combines these predicates within an expressive first-order specification language using a lightweight data-driven learning procedure. Notably, this technique requires no programmer annotations, and is equipped with a type-based decision procedure to verify the correctness of discovered specifications. Experimental results indicate that our implementation is both efficient and effective, capable of automatically synthesizing sophisticated shape specifications over a range of complex data types, going well beyond the scope of existing solutions.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "University of Paris", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["He Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:He", "Gustavo Petri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petri:Gustavo", "Suresh Jagannathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jagannathan:Suresh"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2016", "pages": 17}
