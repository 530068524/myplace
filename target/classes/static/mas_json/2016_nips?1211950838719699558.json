In this paper, we propose Anisotropic Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN), a generalization of classical CNNs to non-Euclidean domains, where classical convolutions are replaced by projections over a set of oriented anisotropic diffusion kernels. We use ACNNs to effectively learn intrinsic dense correspondences between deformable shapes, a fundamental problem in geometry processing, arising in a wide variety of applications. We tested ACNNs performance in very challenging settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on some of the most difficult recent correspondence benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Davide Boscaini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boscaini:Davide", "Jonathan Masci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masci:Jonathan", "Emanuele Rodol\u00e0.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodol=agrave=:Emanuele", "Michael M.
