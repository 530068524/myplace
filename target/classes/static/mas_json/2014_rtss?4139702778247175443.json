This paper generalizes that work by integrating CRPD into the schedulability analysis of tasks with arbitrary deadlines for fixed-priority pre-emption threshold scheduling (FPTS). The analysis is complemented by an optimal threshold assignment algorithm that minimizes CRPD. The paper includes a comparative evaluation of the schedulability ratios of FPPS and FPTS, for constrained-deadline tasks, taking CRPD into account.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["M\u00e4lardalen University College", "University of Amsterdam", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "University of York", "M\u00e4lardalen University College"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Reinder J.
