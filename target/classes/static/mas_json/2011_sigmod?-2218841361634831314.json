BE-Tree copes with both high-dimensionality and expressiveness of Boolean expressions by introducing a novel two-phase space-cutting technique that specifically utilizes the discrete and finite domain properties of the space. Furthermore, BE-Tree employs self-adjustment policies to dynamically adapt the tree as the workload changes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to demonstrate the superiority of BE-Tree in comparison with state-of-the-art index structures designed for matching Boolean expressions.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Mohammad Sadoghi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadoghi:Mohammad", "Hans-Arno Jacobsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobsen:Hans=Arno"], "pages": 12}
