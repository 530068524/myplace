Algorithm portfolios aim to combine the strengths of multiple algorithmic approaches by training a classifier that selects or schedules solvers dependent on the given instance. We devise a new classifier that selects solvers based on a cost-sensitive hierarchical clustering model. Experimental results on SAT and MaxSAT show that the new method outperforms the most effective portfolio builders to date.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University College Cork", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yuri Malitsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malitsky:Yuri", "Ashish Sabharwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabharwal:Ashish", "Horst Samulowitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samulowitz:Horst", "Meinolf Sellmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sellmann:Meinolf"], "pages": 7}
