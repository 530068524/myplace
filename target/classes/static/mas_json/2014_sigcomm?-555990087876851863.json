{"title": "FireFly: a reconfigurable wireless data center fabric using free-space optics.", "fields": ["data center", "small form factor", "reconfigurability", "free space optical communication", "fat tree"], "abstract": "Conventional static datacenter (DC) network designs offer extreme cost vs. performance tradeoffs---simple leaf-spine networks are cost-effective but oversubscribed, while \"fat tree\"-like solutions offer good worst-case performance but are expensive. Recent results make a promising case for augmenting an oversubscribed network with reconfigurable inter-rack wireless or optical links. Inspired by the promise of reconfigurability, this paper presents FireFly, an inter-rack network solution that pushes DC network design to the extreme on three key fronts: (1) all links are reconfigurable; (2) all links are wireless; and (3) non top-of-rack switches are eliminated altogether. This vision, if realized, can offer significant benefits in terms of increased flexibility, reduced equipment cost, and minimal cabling complexity. In order to achieve this vision, we need to look beyond traditional RF wireless solutions due to their interference footprint which limits range and data rates. Thus, we make the case for using free-space optics (FSO). We demonstrate the viability of this architecture by (a) building a proof-of-concept prototype of a steerable small form factor FSO device using commodity components and (b) developing practical heuristics to address algorithmic and system-level challenges in network design and management.", "citation": "Citations (138)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Navid Hamed Azimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azimi:Navid_Hamed", "Zafar Ayyub Qazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qazi:Zafar_Ayyub", "Himanshu Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Himanshu", "Vyas Sekar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sekar:Vyas", "Samir R.
