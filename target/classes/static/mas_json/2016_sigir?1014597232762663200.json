{"title": "A Simple Enhancement for Ad-hoc Information Retrieval via Topic Modelling.", "fields": ["information retrieval", "statistical model", "document clustering", "topic model", "bag of words model"], "abstract": "Traditional information retrieval (IR) models, in which a document is normally represented as a bag of words and their frequencies, capture the term-level and document-level information. Topic models, on the other hand, discover semantic topic-based information among words. In this paper, we consider term-based information and semantic information as two features of query terms and propose a simple enhancement for ad-hoc IR via topic modeling. In particular, three topic-based hybrid models, LDA-BM25, LDA-MATF and LDA-LM, are proposed. A series of experiments on eight standard datasets show that our proposed models can always outperform significantly the corresponding strong baselines over all datasets in terms of MAP and most of datasets in terms of P@5 and P@20. A direct comparison on eight standard datasets also indicates our proposed models are at least comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Central China Normal University", "York University", "York University", "Central China Normal University", "Central China Normal University"], "authors": ["Fanghong Jian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jian:Fanghong", "Jimmy Xiangji Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jimmy_Xiangji", "Jiashu Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Jiashu", "Tingting He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Tingting", "Po Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Po"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
