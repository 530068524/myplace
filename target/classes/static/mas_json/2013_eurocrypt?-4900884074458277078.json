{"title": "Amplification of Chosen-Ciphertext Security.", "fields": ["ciphertext", "discrete mathematics", "correctness", "cryptography", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "A central question in the theory of public-key cryptography is to determine which minimal assumptions are sufficient to achieve security against chosen-ciphertext attacks (or CCA-security, for short). Following the large body of work on hardness and correctness amplification, we investigate how far we can weaken CCA security and still be able to efficiently transform any scheme satisfying such a weaker notion into a fully CCA-secure one.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Boston University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Huijia Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Huijia", "Stefano Tessaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tessaro:Stefano"], "pages": 17}
