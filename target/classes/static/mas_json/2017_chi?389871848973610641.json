{"title": "The Bag of Communities: Identifying Abusive Behavior Online with Preexisting Internet Data.", "fields": ["world wide web", "harassment", "social computing", "the internet", "multimedia"], "abstract": "Since its earliest days, harassment and abuse have plagued the Internet. Recent research has focused on in-domain methods to detect abusive content and faces several challenges, most notably the need to obtain large training corpora. In this paper, we introduce a novel computational approach to address this problem called Bag of Communities (BoC)---a technique that leverages large-scale, preexisting data from other Internet communities. We then apply BoC toward identifying abusive behavior within a major Internet community. Specifically, we compute a post's similarity to 9 other communities from 4chan, Reddit, Voat and MetaFilter. We show that a BoC model can be used on communities \"off the shelf\" with roughly 75% accuracy---no training examples are needed from the target community. A dynamic BoC model achieves 91.18% accuracy after seeing 100,000 human-moderated posts, and uniformly outperforms in-domain methods. Using this conceptual and empirical work, we argue that the BoC approach may allow communities to deal with a range of common problems, like abusive behavior, faster and with fewer engineering resources.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Padua", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Eshwar Chandrasekharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandrasekharan:Eshwar", "Mattia Samory.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samory:Mattia", "Anirudh Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Anirudh", "Eric Gilbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilbert:Eric"], "pages": 13}
