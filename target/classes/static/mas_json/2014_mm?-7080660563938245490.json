{"title": "Stoicheia: Architecture, Sound and Tesla's Apotheosis.", "fields": ["ephemeral key", "making of", "aether", "immediacy", "apotheosis"], "abstract": "Stoicheia, is an immersive installation focusing on the making of a synthetic ecology and informing the process of architecture using sound. After the reception of enigmatic radio signals in 1899, Tesla began work for many years to perfect the receiving and transmitting equipment that was needed to better pick up and translate his aural discoveries. Stoicheia explores similar notions of Telsa's Aether using specific data feeds and scanning techniques to create a dynamic spatial soundscape drawing upon an experience of immediacy, and ephemeral interplay between the agencies that maintain a continuously self-adaptive sonic and physical environment.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["F.
