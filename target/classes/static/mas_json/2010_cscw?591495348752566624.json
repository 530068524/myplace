The introduction of a revolutionary head-to-head fighting game called \"Street Fighter II\" in 1991 ushered in an era of competitive video gaming with unparalleled complexity. An influx of copy-cat games and the arrival of consoles with capabilities rivaling coin-ops led to the arcade's demise. However, the release of \"Street Fighter IV\" (SF4) has brought about a revival. I report on the cultural practices of hardcore gaming that have revolved around SF4. SF4's release on both the console (which enables fighting others online) and the arcade has engendered a new set of challenges in constructing what it means to be competitive and legitimate in the world of head-to-head fighting games. I observe that the \"enrolment\" of an ecology of technological artifacts allows players to translate braggadocio from the arcade, a central phenomenon in competitive gaming.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Norman Makoto Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Norman_Makoto"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
