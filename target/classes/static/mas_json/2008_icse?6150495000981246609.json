{"title": "Models for model's sake: why explicit system models are also an end to themselves.", "fields": ["model based design", "software architecture", "autosar", "automotive software", "unified modeling language"], "abstract": "In automotive software and system design, explicit system and especially software models have only recently found their way into the development process. This paper will try to give an overview for what such models have so-far been used and which advantages they brought to vehicle manufacturers and suppliers.   Another focus of this paper is the comparison to functional models which are already used in the automotive industry to define control algorithms and function implementation. In many cases too strong analogies have been seen between the existing functional control algorithm models and the new system models - leading to suboptimal development processes and tools. This paper will therefore try to outline differences between these model types.   Finally, a synthesis between functional, system, and software models will be sketched.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["dSPACE GmbH", "dSPACE GmbH"], "authors": ["Oliver Niggemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niggemann:Oliver", "Joachim Stroop.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stroop:Joachim"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
