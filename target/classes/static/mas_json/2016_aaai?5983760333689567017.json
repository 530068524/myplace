Software diagnosis algorithm identify the faulty software components that caused a failure using model-based or spectrum based approaches. We show how software fault prediction algorithms can be used to improve software diagnosis. The resulting data-augmented diagnosis algorithm overcomes key problems in software diagnosis algorithms: ranking diagnoses and distinguishing between diagnoses with high probability and low probability. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach empirically on three open sources domains, showing significant increase in accuracy of diagnosis and efficiency of troubleshooting. These encouraging results suggests broader use of data-driven methods to complement and improve existing model-based methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Amir Elmishali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elmishali:Amir", "Roni Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Roni", "Meir Kalech.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalech:Meir"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
