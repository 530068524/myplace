By causing two vortex rings carrying scented air to collide with each other, a local distribution of scent can be achieved in free space. Thus far, however, the behavior of scented air after vortex collision has not been controlled. In this study, we propose a method for varying the moving direction of scented air after the collision by precisely controlling the timing and velocity when expelling vortex rings. We conducted an initial experiment to examine the feasibility of this method and found that direction control of the airflow after vortex collision can be achieved by adjusting the velocity of vortex rings.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Meijo University", "Meijo University", "Meijo University", "Meijo University"], "authors": ["Yasuyuki Yanagida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yanagida:Yasuyuki", "Masashi Kajima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kajima:Masashi", "Shunpei Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Shunpei", "Yuya Yoshioka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshioka:Yuya"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
