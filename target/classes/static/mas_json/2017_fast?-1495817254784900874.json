{"title": "Omid, Reloaded: Scalable and Highly-Available Transaction Processing.", "fields": ["transactions per second", "database transaction", "data access", "scalability", "transaction processing"], "abstract": "We present Omid - a transaction processing service that powers web-scale production systems at Yahoo. Omid provides ACID transaction semantics on top of traditional key-value storage; its implementation over Apache HBase is open sourced as part of Apache Incubator. Omid can serve hundreds of thousands of transactions per second on standard mid-range hardware, while incurring minimal impact on the speed of data access in the underlying key-value store. Additionally, as expected from always-on production services, Omid is highly available.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Edward Bortnikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bortnikov:Edward", "Eshcar Hillel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hillel:Eshcar", "Idit Keidar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keidar:Idit", "Ivan Kelly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelly:Ivan", "Matthieu Morel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morel:Matthieu", "Sameer Paranjpye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paranjpye:Sameer", "Francisco Perez-Sorrosal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perez=Sorrosal:Francisco", "Ohad Shacham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shacham:Ohad"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
