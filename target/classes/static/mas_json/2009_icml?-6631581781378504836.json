For nonparametric Bayesian modeling, the Gaussian process is a useful way to place a prior distribution on this intensity. The combination of a Poisson process and GP is known as a Gaussian Cox process, or doubly-stochastic Poisson process. Likelihood-based inference in these models requires an intractable integral over an infinite-dimensional random function. In this paper we present the first approach to Gaussian Cox processes in which it is possible to perform inference without introducing approximations or finitedimensional proxy distributions. We call our method the Sigmoidal Gaussian Cox Process, which uses a generative model for Poisson data to enable tractable inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare our methods to competing methods on synthetic data and apply it to several real-world data sets.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Toronto", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Ryan Prescott Adams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adams:Ryan_Prescott", "Iain Murray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murray_0001:Iain", "David J.
