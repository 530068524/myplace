{"title": "On the Impact of Heterogeneity and Back-End Scheduling in Load Balancing Designs.", "fields": ["grid computing", "processor sharing", "load management", "inefficiency", "server"], "abstract": "Load balancing is a common approach for task\nassignment in distributed architectures. In this paper, we show\nthat the degree of inefficiency in load balancing designs is highly\ndependent on the scheduling discipline used at each of the backend\nservers. Traditionally, the back-end scheduler can be modeled\nas Processor Sharing (PS), in which case the degree of inefficiency\ngrows linearly with the number of servers. However, if the back-end\nscheduler is changed to Shortest Remaining Processing Time\n(SRPT), the degree of inefficiency can be independent of the\nnumber of servers, instead depending only on the heterogeneity\nof the speeds of the servers. Further, switching the back-end\nscheduler to SRPT can provide significant improvements in\nthe overall mean response time of the system as long as the\nheterogeneity of the server speeds is small.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ho-Lin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ho=Lin", "Jason R.
