{"title": "TouchTools: leveraging familiarity and skill with physical tools to augment touch interaction.", "fields": ["surface computing", "swipe", "tweezers", "touchscreen", "augment"], "abstract": "The average person can skillfully manipulate a plethora of tools, from hammers to tweezers. However, despite this remarkable dexterity, gestures on today's touch devices are simplistic, relying primarily on the chording of fingers:  one -finger pan,  two -finger pinch,  four -finger swipe and similar. We propose that touch gesture design be inspired by the manipulation of physical tools from the real world. In this way, we can leverage user familiarity and fluency with such tools to build a rich set of gestures for touch interaction. With only a few minutes of training on a proof-of-concept system, users were able to summon a variety of virtual tools by replicating their corresponding real-world grasps.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chris Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Chris", "Robert Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Robert", "Julia Schwarz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwarz:Julia", "Scott E.
