Identifying the effect of news on the market is a challenging task. In this demo, we present Forex-foreteller (FF) which mines news articles and makes forecasts about the movement of foreign currency markets. The system uses a combination of language models, topic clustering, and sentiment analysis to identify relevant news articles. These articles along with the historical stock index and currency exchange values are used in a linear regression model to make forecasts. The system has an interactive visualizer designed specifically for touch-sensitive devices which depicts forecasts along with the chronological news events and financial data used for making the forecasts.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Fang Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Fang", "Nathan Self.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Self:Nathan", "Parang Saraf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saraf:Parang", "Patrick Butler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Butler:Patrick", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0064:Wei", "Naren Ramakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramakrishnan:Naren"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
