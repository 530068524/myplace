The deployment of coexisting cognitive radio networks, however, raises a great challenge to the medium access control (MAC) protocol design. While there have been many MAC protocols developed for cognitive radio networks, most of them have not considered the coexistence of cognitive radio networks, and thus do not provide a mechanism to ensure fair and efficient coexistence of cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel MAC protocol, termed fairness-oriented media access control (FMAC), to address the dynamic availability of channels and achieve fair and efficient coexistence of cognitive radio networks. Different from the existing MACs, FMAC utilizes a three-state spectrum sensing model to distinguish whether a busy channel is being used by a primary user or a secondary user from an adjacent cognitive radio network. As a result, secondary users from coexisting cognitive radio networks are able to share the channel together, and hence to achieve fair and efficient coexistence. We develop an analytical model using two-level Markov chain to analyze the performance of FMAC including throughput and fairness. Numerical results verify that FMAC is able to significantly improve the fairness of coexisting cognitive radio networks while maintaining a high throughput.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["South Dakota School of Mines and Technology", "University of Toledo", "Norfolk State University"], "authors": ["Yanxiao Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yanxiao", "Min Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song_0002:Min", "Chunsheng Xin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xin:Chunsheng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
