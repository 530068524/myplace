{"title": "Practical Multi-party Private Set Intersection from Symmetric-Key Techniques.", "fields": ["pseudorandom function family", "secure multi party computation", "symmetric key algorithm", "abstraction", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "intersection"], "abstract": "We present a new paradigm for multi-party private set intersection (PSI) that allows $n$ parties to compute the intersection of their datasets without revealing any additional information. We explore a variety of instantiations of this paradigm. Our protocols avoid computationally expensive public-key operations and are secure in the presence of any number of semi-honest participants (i.e., without an honest majority).   We demonstrate the practicality of our protocols with an implementation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a multi-party PSI protocol. For 5 parties with data-sets of 2 20  items each, our protocol requires only 72 seconds. In an optimization achieving a slightly weaker variant of security (augmented semi-honest model), the same task requires only 22 seconds.   The technical core of our protocol is oblivious evaluation of a  programmable  pseudorandom function (OPPRF), which we instantiate in three different ways. We believe our new OPPRF abstraction and constructions may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Vladimir Kolesnikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolesnikov:Vladimir", "Naor Matania.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matania:Naor", "Benny Pinkas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinkas:Benny", "Mike Rosulek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosulek:Mike", "Ni Trieu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trieu:Ni"], "pages": 16}
