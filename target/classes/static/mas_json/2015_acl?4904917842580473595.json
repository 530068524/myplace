A transition-based greedy neural parser has given better accuracies over its linear counterpart. We propose a neural probabilistic structured-prediction model for transition-based dependency parsing, which integrates search and learning. Beam search is used for decoding, and contrastive learning is performed for maximizing the sentence-level log-likelihood. In standard Penn Treebank experiments, the structured neural parser achieves a 1.8% accuracy improvement upon a competitive greedy neural parser baseline, giving performance comparable to the best linear parser.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Hao", "Yue Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yue", "Shujian Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Shujian", "Jiajun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiajun"], "pages": 10}
