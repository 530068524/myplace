{"title": "Linearly constrained Gaussian processes.", "fields": ["operator", "machine learning", "gaussian process", "covariance function", "constructive"], "abstract": "We consider a modification of the covariance function in Gaussian processes to correctly account for known linear constraints. By modelling the target function as a transformation of an underlying function, the constraints are explicitly incorporated in the model such that they are guaranteed to be fulfilled by any sample drawn or prediction made. We also propose a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator and illustrate the result on both simulated and real-data examples.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Uppsala University", "University of Newcastle", "Uppsala University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Carl Jidling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jidling:Carl", "Niklas Wahlstr\u00f6m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wahlstr=ouml=m:Niklas", "Adrian Wills.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wills:Adrian", "Thomas B.
