{"title": "Programming, Problem Solving, and Self-Awareness: Effects of Explicit Guidance.", "fields": ["code", "metacognition", "mindset", "web development", "mental representation"], "abstract": "More people are learning to code than ever, but most learning opportunities do not explicitly teach the problem solving skills necessary to succeed at open-ended programming problems. In this paper, we present a new approach to impart these skills, consisting of: 1) explicit instruction on programming problem solving, which frames coding as a process of translating mental representations of problems and solutions into source code, 2) a method of visualizing and monitoring progression through six problem solving stages, 3) explicit, on-demand prompts for learners to reflect on their strategies when seeking help from instructors, and 4) context-sensitive help embedded in a code editor that reinforces the problem solving instruction. We experimentally evaluated the effects of our intervention across two 2-week web development summer camps with 48 high school students, finding that the intervention increased productivity, independence, programming self-efficacy, metacognitive awareness, and growth mindset. We discuss the implications of these results on learning technologies and classroom instruction.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dastyni Loksa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loksa:Dastyni", "Andrew Jensen Ko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ko:Andrew_Jensen", "Will Jernigan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jernigan:Will", "Alannah Oleson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oleson:Alannah", "Christopher J.
