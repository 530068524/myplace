Unlike other visual recognition tasks in computer vision, it is difficult to find good, reliable features that can tell material categories apart. Our strategy is to use a rich set of low and mid-level features that capture various aspects of material appearance. We propose an augmented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (aLDA) model to combine these features under a Bayesian generative framework and learn an optimal combination of features. Experimental results show that our system performs material recognition reasonably well on a challenging material database, outperforming state-of-the-art material/texture recognition systems.", "citation": "Citations (182)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Disney Research", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ce Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ce", "Lavanya Sharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharan:Lavanya", "Edward H.
