Their reported empirical success however lacks solid theoretical interpretations for its inherent mechanism. In this paper, we reformulate their model from a brand-new geometrical perspective and have eventually reached a full interpretation on some interesting but unclear empirical phenomenons from their experiments. Furthermore, by extending the definition of generalization for generative adversarial nets to a broader sense, we have derived a condition to control the generalization capability of their model. According to our derived condition, several practical suggestions have also been proposed on model design and dataset construction as a guidance for further empirical researches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Xudong Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Xudong", "Mi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Mi", "Daizong Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Daizong"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
