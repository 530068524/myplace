In this paper, we examine Facebook use in a country where social media participation is growing, but less developed technological infrastructures and uneven access to technology limit use. We conducted observations and 24 interviews at Internet cafes in rural Kenya. Our findings reveal how costs associated with using the Internet, limited access to computers and smartphones and unreliable electricity hinder online participation. We draw on these results to discuss the critical role of constraints in understanding social media use, to raise questions about broadening online participation and to highlight ethical issues researchers must consider when studying Facebook use in developing regions.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "University of Michigan", "Drexel University"], "authors": ["Susan Wyche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wyche:Susan", "Sarita Yardi Schoenebeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schoenebeck:Sarita_Yardi", "Andrea Forte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forte:Andrea"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
