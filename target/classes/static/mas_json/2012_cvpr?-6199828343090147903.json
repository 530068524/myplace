However, pedestrian detection in crowded scenes is still challenging due to the significant appearance variation caused by heavy occlusions and complex spatial interactions. In this paper we propose a unified probabilistic framework to globally describe multiple pedestrians in crowded scenes in terms of appearance and spatial interaction. We utilize a mixture model, where every pedestrian is assumed in a special subclass and described by the sub-model. Scores of pedestrian parts are used to represent appearance and quadratic kernel is used to represent relative spatial interaction. For efficient inference, multi-pedestrian detection is modeled as a MAP problem and we utilize greedy algorithm to get an approximation. For discriminative parameter learning, we formulate it as a learning to rank problem, and propose Latent Rank SVM for learning from weakly labeled data. Experiments on various databases validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Junjie Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Junjie", "Zhen Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Zhen", "Dong Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Dong", "Stan Z.
