These rich data sources also offer opportunities for learning and discovery by motivated third parties. We employ a custom-designed storytelling application in constructing meaningful lifelog summaries from third-party perspectives. This storytelling initiative was implemented as a core component in a university media-editing course. We present promising results from a preliminary study conducted to evaluate the utility and potential of our approach in creatively interpreting a unique experiential dataset.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Dublin City University", "Arizona State University", "Dublin City University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daragh Byrne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Byrne:Daragh", "Aisling Kelliher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelliher:Aisling", "Gareth J.
