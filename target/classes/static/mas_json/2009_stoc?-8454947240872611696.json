We give the first rigorous proof that Pollard's Kangaroo method finds the discrete logarithm in expected time (3+o(1))\u221a{b-a} for the worst value of x\u2208[a,b], and (2+o(1))\u221ab-a when x\u2208 uar [a,b]. This matches the conjectured time complexity and, rare among the analysis of algorithms based on Markov chains, even the lead constants 2 and 3 are correct.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Lowell", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ravi Montenegro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montenegro:Ravi", "Prasad Tetali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tetali:Prasad"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
