In this work we revisit their instantiation and stand-alone implementation. Specifically, we propose new parameters and a better suited error distribution, analyze the scheme's hardness against attacks by quantum computers in a conservative way, introduce a new and more efficient error-reconciliation mechanism, and propose a defense against backdoors and all-for-the-price-of-one attacks. By these measures and for the same lattice dimension, we more than double the security parameter, halve the communication overhead, and speed up computation by more than a factor of 8 in a portable C implementation and by more than a factor of 27 in an optimized implementation targeting current Intel CPUs. These speedups are achieved with comprehensive protection against timing attacks.", "citation": "Citations (253)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Ege University", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Infineon Technologies", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Erdem Alkim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alkim:Erdem", "L\u00e9o Ducas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ducas:L=eacute=o", "Thomas P\u00f6ppelmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=ouml=ppelmann:Thomas", "Peter Schwabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwabe:Peter"], "pages": 17}
