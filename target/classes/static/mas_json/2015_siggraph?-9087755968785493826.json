{"title": "VISTouch.", "fields": ["computer hardware", "computer science", "mobile device", "simulation"], "abstract": "It has become remarkably common recently for people to own multiple mobile devices, although it is still difficult to effectively use them in combination. In this study, we constructed a new system called VISTouch that achieves a new operational capability and increases user interest in mobile devices by enabling multiple devices to be used in combination dynamically and spatially. Using VISTouch, for example, to spatially connect a smart-phone to a horizontally positioned tablet that is displaying a map as viewed from above enables these devices to dynamically obtain the correct relative position. The smart-phone displays images viewed from its position, direction, and angle in real time as a window to show the virtual 3D space. We applied VISTouch to two applications that used detailed information of the relative position in real space between multiple devices. These applications showed the potential improvement in using multiple devices in combination.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tokyo University of Technology", "Tokyo University of Technology"], "authors": ["Masasuke Yasumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yasumoto:Masasuke", "Takehiro Teraoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teraoka:Takehiro"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
