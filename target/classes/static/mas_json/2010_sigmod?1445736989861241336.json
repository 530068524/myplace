The main reason behind this surge in popularity is the social experience associated with connecting content to people and also connecting people with other people. Knowing, seeing, hearing what our friends and like-minded people feel or listen to or upload is an unparalleled experience. Similar to real life, finding good friends is not easy without the help of good recommendations.

We will also comment on both the quality and the effectiveness of the algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["MySpace, Inc.,  ... eattle, WA, USA", "MySpace, Inc.,  ... eattle, WA, USA", "MySpace, Inc.,  ...
