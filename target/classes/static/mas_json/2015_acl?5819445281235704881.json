{"title": "Discontinuous Incremental Shift-reduce Parsing.", "fields": ["beam search", "tiger", "linear classifier", "pattern recognition", "parsing"], "abstract": "We present an extension to incremental shift-reduce parsing that handles discontinuous constituents, using a linear classifier and beam search. We achieve very high parsing speeds (up to 640 sent./sec.) and accurate results (up to 79.52 F1 on TiGer).", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of D\u00fcsseldorf"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Wolfgang Maier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maier:Wolfgang"], "pages": 11}
