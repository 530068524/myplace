The problem has been shown to be as hard as worst-case lattice problems, and in recent years it has served as the foundation for a plethora of cryptographic applications. Unfortunately, these applications are rather inefficient due to an inherent quadratic overhead in the use of LWE. A main open question was whether LWE and its applications could be made truly efficient by exploiting extra algebraic structure, as was done for lattice-based hash functions (and related primitives).\n\nWe resolve this question in the affirmative by introducing an algebraic variant of LWE called ring-LWE, and proving that it too enjoys very strong hardness guarantees. Specifically, we show that the ring-LWE distribution is pseudorandom, assuming that worst-case problems on ideal lattices are hard for polynomial-time quantum algorithms. Applications include the first truly practical lattice-based public-key cryptosystem with an efficient security reduction; moreover, many of the other applications of LWE can be made much more efficient through the use of ring-LWE. Finally, the algebraic structure of ring-LWE might lead to new cryptographic applications previously not known to be based on LWE.", "citation": "Citations (790)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Tel Aviv University", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "New York University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Vadim Lyubashevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyubashevsky:Vadim", "Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris", "Oded Regev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regev_0001:Oded"], "pages": 23}
