{"title": "Annotating web images using NOVA: NOn-conVex group spArsity.", "fields": ["data set", "regular polygon", "local optimum", "nova", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "As image feature vector is large, selecting the right features plays a fundamental role in Web image annotation. Most existing approaches are either based on individual feature selection, which leads to local optima, or using a  convex  penalty, which leads to inconsistency. To address these difficulties, in this paper we propose a new sparsity-based approach NOVA (NOn-conVex group spArsity). To the best of our knowledge, NOVA is the first to introduce non-convex penalty for group selection in high-dimensional heterogeneous features space. Because it is a group-sparsity approach, it approximately reaches global optima. Because it uses non-convex penalty, it achieves the consistency. We demonstrate the superior performance of NOVA via three means. First, we present theoretical proof that NOVA is consistent, satisfying un-biasness, sparsity and continuity. Second, we show NOVA converges to the true underlying model by using a ground-truth-available generative-model simulation. Third, we report extensive experimental results on three diverse and widely-used data sets Kodak, MSRA-MM 2.0, and NUS-WIDE. We also compare NOVA against the state-of-the-art approaches, and report superior experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Microsoft", "Zhejiang University", "Department of E ... pore, Singapore"], "authors": ["Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Ying Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Ying", "Yong Rui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rui:Yong", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
