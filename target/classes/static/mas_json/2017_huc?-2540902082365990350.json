To this end, we implement atmoSphere, a haptic ball to prototype several haptic/audio designs. AtmoSphere consists of a sphere shaped device which provides haptic feedback. The users can experience the design aimed at instructing them in breathing techniques shown to enhance meditation.   The aim of the haptic/audio design is to guide the user into a particular rhythm of breathing. We detect this rhythm using smart eyewear (J!NS MEME) that estimates cardiac and respiratory parameters using embedded motion sensors. Once this rhythm is achieved the feedback stops. If the user drops out of the rhythm, the haptic/audio feedback starts again.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Benjamin Tag.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tag:Benjamin", "Takuya Goto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goto:Takuya", "Kouta Minamizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minamizawa:Kouta", "Ryan Mannschreck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannschreck:Ryan", "Haruna Fushimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fushimi:Haruna", "Kai Kunze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kunze:Kai"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
