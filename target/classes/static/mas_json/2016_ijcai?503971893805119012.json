{"title": "Relevance for SAT(ID).", "fields": ["heuristics", "well founded semantics", "early stopping", "exploit", "nice"], "abstract": "Inductive definitions and justifications are well-studied concepts. Solvers that support inductive definitions have been developed, but several of their computationally nice properties have never been exploited to improve these solvers. In this paper, we present a new notion called relevance. We determine a class of literals that are relevant for a given definition and partial interpretation, and show that choices on irrelevant atoms can never benefit the search for a model. We propose an early stopping criterion and a modification of existing heuristics that exploit relevance. We present a first implementation in MinisatID and experimentally evaluate our approach, and study how often existing solvers make choices on irrelevant atoms.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Aalto University", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Joachim Jansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jansen:Joachim", "Bart Bogaerts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogaerts_0001:Bart", "Jo Devriendt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Devriendt:Jo", "Gerda Janssens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Janssens:Gerda", "Marc Denecker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denecker:Marc"], "pages": 7}
