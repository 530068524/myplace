{"title": "Comparing Objective and Subjective Measures of Usability in a Human-Robot Dialogue System.", "fields": ["recall", "human robot interaction", "robot", "computer user satisfaction", "usability"], "abstract": "We present a human-robot dialogue system that enables a robot to work together with a human user to build wooden construction toys. We then describe a study in which naive subjects interacted with this system under a range of conditions and then completed a user-satisfaction questionnaire. The results of this study provide a wide range of subjective and objective measures of the quality of the interactions. To assess which aspects of the interaction had the greatest impact on the users' opinions of the system, we used a method based on the PARADISE evaluation framework (Walker et al., 1997) to derive a performance function from our data. The major contributors to user satisfaction were the number of repetition requests (which had a negative effect on satisfaction), the dialogue length, and the users' recall of the system instructions (both of which contributed positively).", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mary Ellen Foster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foster:Mary_Ellen", "Manuel Giuliani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giuliani:Manuel", "Alois Knoll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knoll:Alois"], "pages": 9}
