However, most of these applications aggressively collect users sensing data without providing clear statements on the usage and disclosure strategies of such sensitive information, which raises severe privacy concerns and leads to some initial investigation on privacy preservation mechanisms design. While most prior studies have assumed static adversary models, we investigate the context dynamics and call attention to the existence of intelligent adversaries. In this paper, we first identify the context privacy problem with consideration of the context dynamics and malicious adversaries with capabilities of adjusting their attack- ing strategies, and then formulate the interactive competition between users and adversaries as a zero-sum stochastic game. In addition, we propose an efficient minimax learning algorithm to obtain the optimal defense strategy. Our evaluations on real smartphone context traces of 94 users validate the proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0050:Wei", "Qian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Qian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
