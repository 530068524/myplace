{"title": "BART in Action: Error Generation and Empirical Evaluations of Data-Cleaning Systems.", "fields": ["dirty data", "information system", "data management", "strengths and weaknesses", "software"], "abstract": "Repairing erroneous or conflicting data that violate a set of constraints is an important problem in data management. Many automatic or semi-automatic data-repairing algorithms have been proposed in the last few years, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Bart is an open-source error-generation system conceived to support thorough experimental evaluations of these data-repairing systems. The demo is centered around three main lessons. To start, we discuss how generating errors in data is a complex problem, with several facets. We introduce the important notions of detectability and repairability of an error, that stand at the core of Bart. Then, we show how, by changing the features of errors, it is possible to influence quite significantly the performance of the tools. Finally, we concretely put to work five data-repairing algorithms on dirty data of various kinds generated using Bart, and discuss their performance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Basilicata", "University of Toronto", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "University of Basilicata", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Donatello Santoro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santoro:Donatello", "Patricia C.
