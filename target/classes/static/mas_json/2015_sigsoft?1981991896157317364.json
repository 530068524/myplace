However, it is often hard to fully meet both in practice. Security measures are complex by nature and often complicate work flows. Vice versa, insecure systems are typically not usable in practice. To tackle this, we aim at finding the best balance between usability and security in software engineering and administration. Our methodology is based on active involvement of large user groups and analyzes user feedback in order to optimize security mechanisms with respect to their user experience, with a focus on security awareness. It is applied during requirements elicitation and prototyping, and to dynamically adapt unsuited security policies at runtime.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society"], "authors": ["Denis Feth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feth:Denis"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
