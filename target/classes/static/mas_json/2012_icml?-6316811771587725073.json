Recently, there has been an increasing interest in learning features from spatio-temporal, binocular, or other multi-observation data, where the goal is to encode the relationship between images rather than the content of a single image. We provide an analysis of multi-view feature learning, which shows that hidden variables encode transformations by detecting rotation angles in the eigenspaces shared among multiple image warps. Our analysis helps explain recent experimental results showing that transformation-specific features emerge when training complex cell models on videos. Our analysis also shows that transformation-invariant features can emerge as a by-product of learning representations of transformations.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Goethe University Frankfurt"], "authors": ["Roland Memisevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Memisevic:Roland"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
