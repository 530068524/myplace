Mobile clients submit actions through an access network to a game server. The game server generates video frames at a constant frame rate. At the mobile device, the display of these frames represent game status updates. We develop a Markov model to characterize the frame delivery process in low-latency edge cloud gaming systems. Based on this model, we derive a simple formula for the average status age of a tightly synchronized low-latency mobile gaming system in which the inter-frame period is a significant contributor to the system latency. We validate the model by ns-3 simulation of a low-latency edge cloud gaming system. Our evaluation scenarios included single-player games as well as multi-player games in which the game processing was conducted by a combination of a centralized game server and edge cloud renderers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Applied Communication Sciences", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Roy D.
