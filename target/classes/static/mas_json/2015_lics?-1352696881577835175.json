{"title": "Tree-like Queries in OWL 2 QL: Succinctness and Complexity Results.", "fields": ["conjunctive query", "bounded function", "web ontology language", "ranging", "succinctness"], "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of query topology on the difficulty of answering conjunctive queries in the presence of OWL 2 QL ontologies. Our first contribution is to clarify the worst-case size of positive existential (PE), non-recursive Data log (NDL), and first-order (FO) rewritings for various classes of tree-like conjunctive queries, ranging from linear queries to bounded tree width queries. Perhaps our most surprising result is a super polynomial lower bound on the size of PE-rewritings that holds already for linear queries and ontologies of depth 2. More positively, we show that polynomial-size NDL-rewritings always exist for tree-shaped queries with a bounded number of leaves (and arbitrary ontologies), and for bounded tree width queries paired with bounded depth ontologies. For FO-rewritings, we equate the existence of polysize rewritings with well-known problems in Boolean circuit complexity. As our second contribution, we analyze the computational complexity of query answering and establish tractability results (either NL-or LOGCFL-completeness) for a range of query-ontology pairs. Combining our new results with those from the literature yields a complete picture of the succinctness and complexity landscapes for the considered classes of queries and ontologies.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology", "Lab. de Rech. e ... , Orsay, France", "Steklov Math.
