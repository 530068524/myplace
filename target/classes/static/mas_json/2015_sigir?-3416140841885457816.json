{"title": "A Similarity Measure for Weaving Patterns in Textiles.", "fields": ["jaccard index", "similarity measure", "hamming code", "constraint graph", "weaving"], "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for measuring the similarity between weaving patterns that can provide similarity-based search functionality for textile archives. We represent textile structures using hypergraphs and extract multisets of $k$-neighborhoods from these graphs. The resulting multisets are then compared using Jaccard coefficients, Hamming distances, and cosine measures. We evaluate the different variants of our similarity measure experimentally, showing that it can be implemented efficiently and illustrating its quality using it to cluster and query a data set containing more than a thousand textile samples.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Open University"], "authors": ["Sven Helmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helmer:Sven", "Vuong Minh Ngo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ngo:Vuong_Minh"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
