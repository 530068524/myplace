We analyze in this paper this popular strategy, and prove that its worst case complexity is exponential in the number of variables. We then oppose this pessimistic result to an (optimistic) approximate analysis: We show that an approximate path with at most O(1/\u221ae) linear segments can always be obtained, where every point on the path is guaranteed to be optimal up to a relative e-duality gap. We complete our theoretical analysis with a practical algorithm to compute these approximate paths.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Julien Mairal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mairal:Julien", "Bin Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Bin"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
