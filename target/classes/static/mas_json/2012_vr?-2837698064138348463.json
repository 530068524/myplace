As examples of ambient intelligence on the human trajectory and behaviors, the \"ambient intelligence map\" is introduced. Next, the robotic services of shopping support for elderly, touring supports for wheelchair users in real shopping mall are developed using the map. The research trends and perspectives and the standardization for this technology are also introduced.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["ATR Intelligent ... ratories, Japan"], "authors": ["Norihiro Hagita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hagita:Norihiro"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 1}
