We consider this problem with the additional feature that agents' preferences involve uncertainty. The setting with uncertainty leads to a number of interesting questions including the following ones. How to compute an assignment with the highest probability of being Pareto optimal? What is the complexity of computing the probability that a given assignment is Pareto optimal? Does there exist an assignment that is Pareto optimal with probability one? We consider these problems under two natural uncertainty models: (1) the lottery model in which each agent has an independent probability distribution over linear orders and (2) the joint probability model that involves a joint probability distribution over preference profiles. For both of these models, we present a number of algorithmic and complexity results highlighting the difference and similarities in the complexity of the two models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Amsterdam University College", "University of Glasgow", "University of New South Wales", "Vienna University of Technology", "University of Glasgow", "Commonwealth Sc ... ch Organization"], "authors": ["Haris Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz_0001:Haris", "Ronald de Haan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haan:Ronald_de", "Baharak Rastegari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rastegari:Baharak"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
