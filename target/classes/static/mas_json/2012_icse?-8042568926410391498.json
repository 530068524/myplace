In this paper we present the EVOSS tool that has been defined to support the upgrade of free and open source software systems. EVOSS is composed of a simulator and of a fault detector component. The simulator is able to predict failures before they can affect the real system. The fault detector component has been defined to discover inconsistencies in the system configuration model. EVOSS improves the state of the art of current tools, which are able to predict a very limited set of upgrade faults, while they leave a wide range of faults unpredicted.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of L'Aquila", "University of L'Aquila", "University of L'Aquila"], "authors": ["Davide Di Ruscio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruscio:Davide_Di", "Patrizio Pelliccione.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pelliccione:Patrizio", "Alfonso Pierantonio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pierantonio:Alfonso"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
