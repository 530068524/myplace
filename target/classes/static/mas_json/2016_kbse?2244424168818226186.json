Once a fault is detected it must be repaired immediately, hence continuous integration provides an ideal testbed for experimenting with the state of the art in fault localisation. In this paper we propose a variant of what is known as spectrum based fault localisation, which leverages patterns of method calls by means of frequent itemset mining. We compare our variant (we refer to it as patterned spectrum analysis) against the state of the art and demonstrate on 351 real bugs drawn from five representative open source java projects that patterned spectrum analysis is more effective in localising the fault. Based on anecdotal evidence from this comparison, we suggest avenues for further improvements.
