{"title": "On the Insecurity of Parallel Repetition for Leakage Resilience.", "fields": ["probabilistic encryption", "key distribution", "distributed computing", "56 bit encryption", "public key cryptography", "40 bit encryption", "psychological resilience", "leakage", "computer science"], "abstract": "A fundamental question in leakage-resilient cryptography is: can leakage resilience always be amplified by parallel repetition? It is natural to expect that if we have a leakage-resilient primitive tolerating $\\ell$ bits of leakage, we can take $n$ copies of it to form a system tolerating $n\\ell$ bits of leakage. In this paper, we show that this is not always true. We construct a public key encryption system which is secure when at most $\\ell$ bits are leaked, but if we take $n$ copies of the system and encrypt a share of the message under each using an $n$-out-of-$n$ secret-sharing scheme, leaking $n\\ell$ bits renders the system insecure. Our results hold either in composite order bilinear groups under a variant of the subgroup decision assumption \\emph{or} in prime order bilinear groups under the decisional linear assumption. We note that the $n$ copies of our public key systems share a common reference parameter.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Allison B.
