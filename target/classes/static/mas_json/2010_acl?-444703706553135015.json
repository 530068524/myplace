{"title": "Correcting Errors in Speech Recognition with Articulatory Dynamics.", "fields": ["speech recognition", "discretization", "hidden markov model", "bayesian network", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We introduce a novel mechanism for incorporating articulatory dynamics into speech recognition with the theory of task dynamics. This system reranks sentence-level hypotheses by the likelihoods of their hypothetical articulatory realizations which are derived from relationships learned with aligned acoustic/articulatory data. Experiments compare this with two baseline systems, namely an acoustic hidden Markov model and a dynamic Bayes network augmented with discretized representations of the vocal tract. Our system based on task dynamics reduces word-error rates significantly by 10.2% relative to the best baseline models.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Toronto"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Frank Rudzicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudzicz:Frank"], "pages": 9}
