We present a new method that measures user choice, and quantifies it as a measure of utility. Our method has two core features. First, it introduces an economic definition of utility, one that we can operationalize through economic experiments. Second, we employ a novel method of crowdsourcing that enables the collection of thousands of economic judgments from real users.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Michael Toomim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toomim:Michael", "Travis Kriplean.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kriplean:Travis", "Claus P\u00f6rtner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=ouml=rtner:Claus", "James A.
