{"title": "Weakly-supervised Discovery of Visual Pattern Configurations.", "fields": ["object detection", "labeled data", "discriminative model", "optimization problem", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "The prominence of weakly labeled data gives rise to a growing demand for object detection methods that can cope with minimal supervision. We propose an approach that automatically identifies discriminative configurations of visual patterns that are characteristic of a given object class. We formulate the problem as a constrained submodular optimization problem and demonstrate the benefits of the discovered configurations in remedying mislocalizations and finding informative positive and negative training examples. Together, these lead to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised detection results on the challenging PASCAL VOC dataset.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Hyun Oh Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Hyun_Oh", "Yong Jae Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yong_Jae", "Stefanie Jegelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jegelka:Stefanie", "Trevor Darrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darrell:Trevor"], "pages": 9}
