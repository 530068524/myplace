{"title": "A diary study of password usage in daily life.", "fields": ["password policy", "login", "password", "cognitive password", "internet privacy"], "abstract": "While past work has examined password usage on a specific computer, web site, or organization, there is little work examining overall password usage in daily life. Through a diary study, we examine all usage of passwords, and offer some new findings based on quantitative analyses regarding how often people log in, where they log in, and how frequently people use foreign computers. Our analysis also confirms or updates existing statistics about password usage patterns. We also discuss some implications for design as well as security education.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Eiji Hayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayashi:Eiji", "Jason I.
