A P2P cache stores parts of the most popular contents locally, and if possible serves the requests of local peers to decrease the inter-ISP traffic. Traditionally, P2P cache resource management focuses on managing the storage resource of the cache so as to maximize the inter-ISP traffic savings. In this paper we show that when there are many overlays competing for the upload bandwidth of a P2P cache then in order to maximize the inter-ISP traffic savings the cache's upload bandwidth should be actively allocated among the overlays. We formulate the problem of P2P cache bandwidth allocation as a Markov decision process, and describe two approximations to the optimal cache bandwidth allocation policy. Based on the insights obtained from the approximate policies we propose SRP, a priority-based allocation policy for BitTorrent-like P2P systems. We use extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed policies, and show that cache bandwidth allocation can improve the inter-ISP traffic savings by up to 30 to 60 percent. We validate the results via BitTorrent experiments on Planet-lab.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "University of W\u00fcrzburg", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Valentino Pacifici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pacifici:Valentino", "Frank Lehrieder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehrieder:Frank", "Gy\u00f6rgy D\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=aacute=n:Gy=ouml=rgy"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
