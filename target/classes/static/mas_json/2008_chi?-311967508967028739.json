We present results from a trial of 'Connecto', a phone based status and location sharing application that allows a group to 'tag' areas and have individuals' locations shared automatically on a mobile phone. In use the system moved beyond being an awareness tool to a way of continuing the ongoing 'story' of conversations within the group. Through sharing status and location the system supported each groups' ongoing repartee - a site for social exchange, enjoyment and friendship.", "citation": "Citations (252)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Louise Barkhuus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barkhuus:Louise", "Barry A.
