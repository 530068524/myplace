Therefore, tools for searching video databases are indispensable. Current techniques that extract features purely based on the visual signals of a video are struggling to achieve good results. By considering video related meta-information, more relevant and precisely delimited search results can be obtained. In this study we propose a novel approach for querying videos based on the notion that the geographical location of the captured scene in addition to the location of a camera can provide valuable information and may be used as a search criterion in many applications. This study provides an estimation model of the viewable area of a scene for indexing and searching and reports on a prototype implementation. Among our objectives is to stimulate a discussion of these topics in the research community as information fusion of different georeferenced data sources is becoming increasingly important. Initial results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "National University of Singapore", "University of Denver"], "authors": ["Sakire Arslan Ay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ay:Sakire_Arslan", "Roger Zimmermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmermann:Roger", "Seon Ho Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seon_Ho"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
