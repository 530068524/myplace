{"title": "Joint Cascade Optimization Using A Product Of Boosted Classifiers.", "fields": ["cascade", "pedestrian detection", "lazy evaluation", "random subspace method", "boosting"], "abstract": "The standard strategy for efficient object detection consists of building a cascade composed of several binary classifiers. The detection process takes the form of a lazy evaluation of the conjunction of the responses of these classifiers, and concentrates the computation on difficult parts of the image which cannot be trivially rejected.\n\nWe introduce a novel algorithm to construct jointly the classifiers of such a cascade, which interprets the response of a classifier as the probability of a positive prediction, and the overall response of the cascade as the probability that all the predictions are positive. From this noisy-AND model, we derive a consistent loss and a Boosting procedure to optimize that global probability on the training set.\n\nSuch a joint learning allows the individual predictors to focus on a more restricted modeling problem, and improves the performance compared to a standard cascade. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach on face and pedestrian detection with standard data-sets and comparisons with reference baselines.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Idiap Research Institute", "Idiap Research Institute"], "authors": ["Leonidas Lefakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lefakis:Leonidas", "Fran\u00e7ois Fleuret.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fleuret:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
