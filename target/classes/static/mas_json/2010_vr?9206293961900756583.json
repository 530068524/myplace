We impose two priors to the cylindrical display: (a) cylinder is a vertically extruded surface; and (b) the aspect ratio of the rectangle formed by the four corners of the screen is known. Using these priors, we can estimate the display's 3D surface geometry and camera extrinsic parameters using a single image without any explicit display to camera correspondences. Using the estimated camera and display properties, we design a novel deterministic algorithm to recover the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of each projector using a single projected pattern seen by the camera which is then used to register the images on the display from any arbitrary viewpoint making it appropriate for virtual reality systems. Finally, our method can be extended easily to handle sharp corners \u2014 making it suitable for the common CAVE like VR setup. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that can achieve accurate geometric auto-calibration of multiple projectors on a cylindrical display without performing an extensive stereo reconstruction.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Behzad Sajadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sajadi:Behzad", "Aditi Majumder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majumder:Aditi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
