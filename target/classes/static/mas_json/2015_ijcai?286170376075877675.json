{"title": "Semantic Topic Multimodal Hashing for Cross-Media Retrieval.", "fields": ["feature hashing", "dynamic perfect hashing", "universal hashing", "hamming space", "double hashing"], "abstract": "Multimodal hashing is essential to cross-media similarity search for its low storage cost and fast query speed. Most existing multimodal hashing methods embedded heterogeneous data into a common low-dimensional Hamming space, and then rounded the continuous embeddings to obtain the binary codes. Yet they usually neglect the inherent discrete nature of hashing for relaxing the discrete constraints, which will cause degraded retrieval performance especially for long codes. For this purpose, a novel Semantic Topic Multimodal Hashing (STMH) is developed by considering latent semantic information in coding procedure. It first discovers clustering patterns of texts and robust factorizes the matrix of images to obtain multiple semantic topics of texts and concepts of images. Then the learned multimodal semantic features are transformed into a common subspace by their correlations. Finally, each bit of unified hash code can be generated directly by figuring out whether a topic or concept is contained in a text or an image. Therefore, the obtained model by STMH is more suitable for hashing scheme as it directly learns discrete hash codes in the coding process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (40)", "departments": ["Xidian University", "Xidian University", "Xidian University", "Xidian University"], "authors": ["Di Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Di", "Xinbo Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Xinbo", "Xiumei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiumei", "Lihuo He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Lihuo"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
