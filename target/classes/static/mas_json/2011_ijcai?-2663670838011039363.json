However, the complexity of these models--NEXP-Complete even for two agents-- has limited scalability. We identify certain mild conditions that are sufficient to make multiagent planning amenable to a scalable approximation w.r.t. the number of agents. This is achieved by constructing a graphical model in which likelihood maximization is equivalent to plan optimization. Using the Expectation-Maximization framework for likelihood maximization, we show that the necessary inference can be decomposed into processes that often involve a small subset of agents, thereby facilitating scalability. We derive a global update rule that combines these local inferences to monotonically increase the overall solution quality. Experiments on a large multiagent planning benchmark confirm the benefits of the new approach in terms of runtime and scalability.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Free University of Berlin"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Akshat Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Akshat", "Shlomo Zilberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zilberstein:Shlomo", "Marc Toussaint.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toussaint:Marc"], "pages": 7}
