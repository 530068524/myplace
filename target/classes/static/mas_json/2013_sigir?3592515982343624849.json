{"title": "Exploiting user feedback to learn to rank answers in q&a forums: a case study with stack overflow.", "fields": ["data mining", "learning to rank", "information retrieval", "stack overflow", "ranking"], "abstract": "Collaborative web sites, such as collaborative encyclopedias, blogs, and forums, are characterized by a loose edit control, which allows anyone to freely edit their content. As a consequence, the quality of this content raises much concern. To deal with this, many sites adopt manual quality control mechanisms. However, given their size and change rate, manual assessment strategies do not scale and content that is new or unpopular is seldom reviewed. This has a negative impact on the many services provided, such as ranking and recommendation. To tackle with this problem, we propose a learning to rank (L2R) approach for ranking answers in QA we also conducted a comprehensive study of the features, showing that (ii) review and user features are the most important in the QA and (iii) the best set of new features we proposed was able to yield the best quality rankings.", "citation": "Citations (42)", "departments": ["Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "Institute of Co ...
