The cognitive radio network considered in this paper consists of a number of heterogeneous sub-networks. These sub-networks may be power-constrained and are required to operate in such a way that the average total interference received on primary channels are kept below given thresholds. We develop a control policy that performs joint admission control and resource scheduling. Through Lyapunov optimization techniques, we show that the proposed policy achieves a utility performance within $O(\\delta)$ of optimality for any positive $\\delta$. We further show that this arbitrarily closeness to optimality comes at the price of having a delay that is $O(\\frac{1}{\\delta})$ in admitting users. We also propose constant factor approximations of the policy for distributed implementation.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Mahdi Lotfinezhad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lotfinezhad:Mahdi", "Ben Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Ben", "Elvino S.
