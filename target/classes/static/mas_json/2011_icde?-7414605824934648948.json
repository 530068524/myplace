Schema matching systems usually exploit lexical and semantic information provided by lexical databases/thesauri to discover intra/inter semantic relationships among schema elements. However, most of them obtain poor performance on real world scenarios due to the significant presence of \u201cnon-dictionary words\u201d. Non-dictionary words include compound nouns, abbreviations and acronyms. In this paper, we present NORMS (NORMalizer of Schemata), a tool performing schema label normalization to increase the number of comparable labels extracted from schemata 1 .", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"], "authors": ["Serena Sorrentino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sorrentino:Serena", "Sonia Bergamaschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergamaschi:Sonia", "Maciej Gawinecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gawinecki:Maciej"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
