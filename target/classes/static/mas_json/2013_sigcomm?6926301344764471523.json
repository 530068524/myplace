{"title": "Less pain, most of the gain: incrementally deployable ICN.", "fields": ["service provider", "latency", "information centric networking", "information and computer science", "architecture"], "abstract": "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has seen a significant resurgence in recent years. ICN promises benefits to users and service providers along several dimensions (e.g., performance, security, and mobility). These benefits, however, come at a non-trivial cost as many ICN proposals envision adding significant complexity to the network by having routers serve as content caches and support nearest-replica routing. This paper is driven by the simple question of whether this additional complexity is justified and if we can achieve these benefits in an incrementally deployable fashion. To this end, we use trace-driven simulations to analyze the quantitative benefits attributed to ICN (e.g., lower latency and congestion). Somewhat surprisingly, we find that pervasive caching and nearest-replica routing are not fundamentally necessary---most of the performance benefits can be achieved with simpler caching architectures. We also discuss how the qualitative benefits of ICN (e.g., security, mobility) can be achieved without any changes to the network. Building on these insights, we present a proof-of-concept design of an incrementally deployable ICN architecture.", "citation": "Citations (385)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Duke University", "University of Toronto", "University of California, Berkeley", "VMware"], "authors": ["Seyed Kaveh Fayazbakhsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fayazbakhsh:Seyed_Kaveh", "Yin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Yin", "Amin Tootoonchian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tootoonchian:Amin", "Ali Ghodsi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghodsi_0002:Ali", "Teemu Koponen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koponen:Teemu", "Bruce M.
