Paths of different homo- topy types can be used to improve load balancing and routing resilience. We propose the first lightweight homotopic routing scheme that generates constant bounded stretch compared to the shortest path of the same homotopy type. Our main insight is that in a sequence of triangles to traverse, a message always routed to the nearest point on the next triangle in the sequence travels at most a constant times the length of any shortest path going through the same sequence of triangles. Our routing scheme operates on two levels enabled by a coarse triangulation. The top level is used to specify and represent the requested homotopy type, while the bottom level executes the local greedy routing on a triangle sequence. After a preprocessing step that triangulates the given region and creates a minimum-size auxiliary structure, routing operates greedily at two different resolutions. We also present simulation analysis in a variety of settings and show that the paths indeed have small stretch in practice, considerably shorter than the bounds guaranteed by the theory. I. INTRODUCTION In this paper we consider the problem of routing in a wire- less sensor network deployed in a complex geometric domain \ufffd with holes. This is a common situation for large-scale sensor networks, as the shape of the sensor deployment region (due to obstacles, terrain variation and other deployment forbidding factors) necessarily comes to play with the network design and management.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "School of Infor ... omputer Science"], "authors": ["Kan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Kan", "Chien-Chun Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Chien=Chun", "Rik Sarkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkar:Rik", "Jie Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jie", "Joseph S.
