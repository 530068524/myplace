Here, we describe the first automated approach for RAM-model secure computation in the semi-honest model. We define an intermediate representation called SCVM and a corresponding type system suited for RAM-model secure computation. Leveraging compile-time optimizations, our approach achieves order-of-magnitude speedups compared to both circuit-model secure computation and the state-of-art RAM-model secure computation.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Chang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chang", "Yan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Yan", "Elaine Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Elaine", "Jonathan Katz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katz:Jonathan", "Michael W.
