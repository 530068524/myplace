{"title": "Learning Discourse-level Diversity for Neural Dialog Models using Conditional Variational Autoencoders.", "fields": ["dialog box", "machine learning", "natural language processing", "latent variable", "encoder"], "abstract": "While recent neural encoder-decoder models have shown great promise in modeling open-domain conversations, they often generate dull and generic responses. Unlike past work that has focused on diversifying the output of the decoder at word-level to alleviate this problem, we present a novel framework based on conditional variational autoencoders that captures the discourse-level diversity in the encoder. Our model uses latent variables to learn a distribution over potential conversational intents and generates diverse responses using only greedy decoders. We have further developed a novel variant that is integrated with linguistic prior knowledge for better performance. Finally, the training procedure is improved by introducing a bag-of-word loss. Our proposed models have been validated to generate significantly more diverse responses than baseline approaches and exhibit competence in discourse-level decision-making.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Tiancheng Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Tiancheng", "Ran Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Ran", "Maxine Esk\u00e9nazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esk=eacute=nazi:Maxine"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
