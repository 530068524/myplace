{"title": "Re-evaluating designs for multi-tenant OLTP workloads on SSD-basedI/O subsystems.", "fields": ["parallel computing", "database virtualization", "cloud computing", "multitenancy", "online transaction processing"], "abstract": "Multi-tenancy is a common practice that is employed to maximize server resources and reduce the total cloud operation costs. The focus of this work is on multi-tenancy for OLTP workloads. Several designs for OLTP multi-tenancy have been proposed that vary the trade-offs made between performance and isolation. However, existing studies have not considered the impact of OLTP multi-tenancy designs when using an SSD-based I/O subsystem. In this paper, we compare three designs using both open-source and proprietary DBMSs on SSD-based I/O subsystems. Our study reveals that in contrast to the case of an HDD-based I/O subsystem, VM-based designs have fairly competitive performance compared to the non-virtualized designs (generally within 1.3-2X of the best performing case) on SSD-based I/O subsystems. Whereas previous studies were based on traditional hard disk-based environments, our results indicate that switching to a pure SSD-based I/O subsystem requires rethinking the trade-offs for multi-tenant OLTP workloads.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ning Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0013:Ning", "Jun'ichi Tatemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tatemura:Jun=ichi", "Jignesh M.
