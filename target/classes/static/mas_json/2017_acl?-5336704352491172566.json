Morphologically rich languages accentuate two properties of distributional vector space models: 1) the difficulty of inducing accurate representations for low-frequency word forms; and 2) insensitivity to distinct lexical relations that have similar distributional signatures. These effects are detrimental for language understanding systems, which may infer that inexpensive is a rephrasing for expensive or may not associate acquire with acquires. In this work, we propose a novel morph-fitting procedure which moves past the use of curated semantic lexicons for improving distributional vector spaces. Instead, our method injects morphological constraints generated using simple language-specific rules, pulling inflectional forms of the same word close together and pushing derivational antonyms far apart. In intrinsic evaluation over four languages, we show that our approach: 1) improves low-frequency word estimates; and 2) boosts the semantic quality of the entire word vector collection. Finally, we show that morph-fitted vectors yield large gains in the downstream task of dialogue state tracking, highlighting the importance of morphology for tackling long-tail phenomena in language understanding tasks.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of Cambridge", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ivan Vulic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vulic:Ivan", "Nikola Mrksic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mrksic:Nikola", "Roi Reichart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reichart:Roi", "Diarmuid \u00d3 S\u00e9aghdha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=eacute=aghdha:Diarmuid_=Oacute=", "Steve J.
