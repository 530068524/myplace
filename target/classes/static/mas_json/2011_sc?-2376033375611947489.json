Among various developed numerical approaches for highly-correlated electrons, the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) has been widely accepted as the most promising numerical scheme compared to Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization in terms of accuracy and accessible system size. In fact, DMRG almost perfectly resolves one-dimensional chain like long quantum systems. In this paper, we suggest its extended approach toward higher-dimensional systems by high-performance computing techniques. The computing target in DMRG is a huge non-uniform sparse matrix diagonalization. In order to efficiently parallelize the part, we implement communication step doubling together with reuse of the mid-point data between the doubled two steps to avoid severe bottleneck of all-to-all communications essential for the diagonalization. The technique is successful even for clusters composed of more than 1000 cores and offers a trustworthy exploration way for two-dimensional highly-correlated systems.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Japan Atomic Energy Agency", "University of Electro-Communications", "Japan Atomic Energy Agency"], "authors": ["Susumu Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada:Susumu", "Toshiyuki Imamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Imamura:Toshiyuki", "Masahiko Machida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Machida:Masahiko"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
