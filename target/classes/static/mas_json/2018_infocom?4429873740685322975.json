{"title": "Closed form Expressions for the Performance Metrics of Data Services in Cellular Networks.", "fields": ["data as a service", "erlang", "network service", "random access", "timeout"], "abstract": "In this paper we study the queuing system that describes the operations of data services in cellular networks, e.g., UMTS, LTE/LTE-A, and most likely the forthcoming 5G standard. The main characteristic of all these systems is that after service access, resources remain allocated to the end user for some time before release, so that if the same user requests access to service again, before a system timeout, the same resources are still available. For the resulting queuing model, we express the blocking probability in closed form, and we also provide recursive expressions in the number of connections that can be handled by the base station. Closed form expressions are also derived for other useful performance metrics, i.e., throughput and network\nservice time. Analytical results are validated against results of a detailed simulation model, and compared to traditional queueing models results, such as the Erlang B formula iteratively applied to the resources that are not blocked by potentially returning users. Our analysis complements the performance evaluation of the other key mechanism used to access data services in cellular networks, namely the random access, which precedes the resource allocation and utilization phase studied in this paper.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Turin", "IMDEA", "University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin"], "authors": ["Paolo Castagno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castagno:Paolo", "Vincenzo Mancuso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mancuso:Vincenzo", "Matteo Sereno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sereno:Matteo", "Marco Ajmone Marsan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marsan:Marco_Ajmone"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
