However, in natural language, some facts are implicit, and identifying them requires \"reading between the lines\". Human readers naturally use common sense knowledge to infer such implicit information from the explicitly stated facts. We propose an approach that uses Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs), a statistical relational model combining firstorder logic and Bayesian networks, to infer additional implicit information from extracted facts. It involves learning uncertain common-sense knowledge (in the form of probabilistic first-order rules) from natural language text by mining a large corpus of automatically extracted facts. These rules are then used to derive additional facts from extracted information using BLP inference. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark data set for machine reading demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sindhu Raghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavan:Sindhu", "Raymond J.
