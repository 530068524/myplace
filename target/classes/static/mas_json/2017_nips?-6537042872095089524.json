In the classical MAB problem, a decision maker must choose an arm at each time step, upon which she receives a reward. The decision maker's objective is to maximize her cumulative expected reward over the time horizon. The MAB problem has been studied extensively, specifically under the assumption of the arms' rewards distributions being stationary, or quasi-stationary, over time. We consider a variant of the MAB framework, which we termed Rotting Bandits, where each arm's expected reward decays as a function of the number of times it has been pulled. We are motivated by many real-world scenarios such as online advertising, content recommendation, crowdsourcing, and more. We present algorithms, accompanied by simulations, and derive theoretical guarantees.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Nir Levine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levine:Nir", "Koby Crammer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crammer:Koby", "Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie"], "pages": 10}
