We apply the tools to construct a class of functions with high amortized memory complexity in the *parallel* Random Oracle Model (pROM); a variant of the standard ROM allowing for batches of *simultaneous* queries. In particular we obtain a new, more robust, type of Memory-Hard Functions (MHF); a security primitive which has recently been gaining acceptance in practice as an effective means of countering brute-force attacks on security relevant functions. Along the way we also demonstrate an important shortcoming of previous definitions of MHFs and give a new definition addressing the problem. The tools we develop represent an adaptation of the powerful pebbling paradigm (initially introduced by Hewitt and Paterson [HP70] and Cook [Coo73]) to a simple and intuitive parallel setting. We define a simple pebbling game G p  over graphs which aims to abstract parallel computation in an intuitive way. As a conceptual contribution we define a measure of pebbling complexity for graphs called *cumulative complexity* (CC) and show how it overcomes a crucial shortcoming (in the parallel setting) exhibited by more traditional complexity measures used in the past. As a main technical contribution we give an explicit construction of a constant in-degree family of graphs whose CC in G p  approaches maximality to within a polylogarithmic factor for any graph of equal size (analogous to the graphs of Tarjan et. al. [PTC76, LT82] for sequential pebbling games). Finally, for a given graph G and related function f G , we derive a lower-bound on the amortized memory complexity of f G  in the pROM in terms of the CC of G in the game G p .", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Jo\u00ebl Alwen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alwen:Jo=euml=l", "Vladimir Serbinenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serbinenko:Vladimir"], "pages": 9}
