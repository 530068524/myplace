{"title": "Radar: Residual Analysis for Anomaly Detection in Attributed Networks.", "fields": ["gene regulatory network", "financial transaction", "ranging", "generality", "residual"], "abstract": "Attributed networks are pervasive in different domains, ranging from social networks, gene regulatory networks to financial transaction networks. This kind of rich network representation presents challenges for anomaly detection due to the heterogeneity of two data representations. A vast majority of existing algorithms assume certain properties of anomalies are given a prior. Since various types of anomalies in real-world attributed networks coexist, the assumption that priori knowledge regarding anomalies is available does not hold. In this paper, we investigate the problem of anomaly detection in attributed networks generally from a residual analysis perspective, which has been shown to be effective in traditional anomaly detection problems. However, it is a non-trivial task in attributed networks as interactions among instances complicate the residual modeling process. Methodologically, we propose a learning framework to characterize the residuals of attribute information and its coherence with network information for anomaly detection. By learning and analyzing the residuals, we detect anomalies whose behaviors are singularly different from the majority. Experiments on real datasets show the effectiveness and generality of the proposed framework.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Texas A&M University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Jundong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jundong", "Harsh Dani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dani:Harsh", "Xia Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Xia", "Huan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Huan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
