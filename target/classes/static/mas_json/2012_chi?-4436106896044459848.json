This paper investigates the usability problems found in the evaluation of six highly interactive websites by 30 users in a task-based evaluation and 14 experts using three different expert evaluation methods. A grounded theory approach was taken to categorize 935 usability problems from the evaluation. Four major categories emerged: Physical presentation, Content, Information Architecture and Interactivity. Each major category had between 5 and 16 sub-categories. The categories and sub-categories were then analysed for whether they were found by users only, experts only or both users and experts. This allowed us to develop an evidence-based set of 21 heuristics to assist in the development and evaluation of interactive websites.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of York", "University of York"], "authors": ["Helen Petrie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrie:Helen", "Christopher Power.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Power:Christopher"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
