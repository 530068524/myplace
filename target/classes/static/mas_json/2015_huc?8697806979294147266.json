We identify seven key challenges: massive volume and variety of data, complexity in identifying stressors, scalability of space, multifaceted relationship between stress and time, a need for representation at multiple granularities, inter-person variability, and limited understanding of JITAI design requirements due to its novelty. We propose four new visualizations based on one million minutes of sensor data (n=70). We evaluate our visualizations with stress researchers (n=6) to gain first insights into its usability and usefulness in JITAI design. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal visualizations help identify and explain between- and within-person variability in stress patterns and contextual visualizations enable decisions regarding the timing, content, and modality of intervention. Interestingly, a granular representation is considered informative but noise-prone; an abstract representation is the preferred starting point for designing JITAIs.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Memphis", "University of Central Florida", "National Institute on Drug Abuse", "University of Michigan", "University of Memphis"], "authors": ["Moushumi Sharmin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharmin:Moushumi", "Andrew Raij.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raij:Andrew", "David Epstien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Epstien:David", "Inbal Nahum-Shani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nahum=Shani:Inbal", "J.
