{"title": "Improved Neural Machine Translation with a Syntax-Aware Encoder and Decoder.", "fields": ["syntax", "machine translation", "machine learning", "soft decision decoder", "encoder"], "abstract": "Most neural machine translation (NMT) models are based on the sequential encoder-decoder framework, which makes no use of syntactic information. In this paper, we improve this model by explicitly incorporating source-side syntactic trees. More specifically, we propose (1) a bidirectional tree encoder which learns both sequential and tree structured representations; (2) a tree-coverage model that lets the attention depend on the source-side syntax. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrate that our proposed models outperform the sequential attentional model as well as a stronger baseline with a bottom-up tree encoder and word coverage.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "University of Notre Dame", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Huadong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Huadong", "Shujian Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Shujian", "David Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang_0001:David", "Jiajun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiajun"], "pages": 10}
