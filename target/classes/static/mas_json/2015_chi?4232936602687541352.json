We present a user study on people's current practices in combining multiple information devices in their everyday lives, ranging from pragmatic tasks to leisure activities. Based on diaries and interviews of 14 participants, we characterize the usage practices of the most common devices, including smartphones, computers, tablets, and home media centers. We analyze 123 real-life multi-device use cases and identify the main usage patterns, including Sequential Use, Resource Lending, Related Parallel Use, and Unrelated Parallel Use. We discuss the practical challenges of using several information devices together. Finally, we identify three levels of decisions that determine which devices are used in a particular situation, including acquiring, making available, and selecting the devices for use.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Nokia", "Tampere University of Technology", "Tampere University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tero Jokela.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jokela:Tero", "Jarno Ojala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ojala:Jarno", "Thomas Olsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olsson_0002:Thomas"], "pages": 10}
