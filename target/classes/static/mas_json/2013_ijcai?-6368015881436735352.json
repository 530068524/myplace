Unlike industrial robots that are programmed to execute a rather limited number of tasks, the new generation of bio-inspired robots is expected to display a wide range of behaviours in unpredictable environments, as well as to interact safely and smoothly with human co-workers. In this article, we put forward some of the properties that will characterize these new robots: soft materials, flexible and stretchable sensors, modular and efficient actuators, self-organization and distributed control. We introduce a number of design principles; in particular, we try to comprehend the novel design space that now includes soft materials and requires a completely different way of thinking about control. We also introduce a recent case study of developing a complex humanoid robot, discuss the lessons learned and speculate about future challenges and perspectives.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Rolf Pfeifer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfeifer:Rolf", "Hugo Gravato Marques.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marques:Hugo_Gravato", "Fumiya Iida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iida:Fumiya"], "pages": 7}
