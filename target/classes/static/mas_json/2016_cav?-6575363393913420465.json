{"title": "Precise and Complete Propagation Based Local Search for Satisfiability Modulo Theories.", "fields": ["satisfiability modulo theories", "completeness", "randomization", "local search", "symbolic execution"], "abstract": "Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is essential for many applications in computer-aided verification. A recent SMT solving approach based on stochastic local search for the theory of quantifier-free fixed-size bit-vectors proved to be quite effective on hard satisfiable instances, particularly in the context of symbolic execution. However, it still relies on brute-force randomization and restarts to achieve completeness. In this paper we simplify, extend, and formalize the propagation-based variant of this approach. We introduce a notion of essential inputs to lift the well-known concept of controlling inputs from the bit-level to the word-level, which allows to prune search. Guided by a formal completeness proof for our propagation-based variant we obtain a clean, simple and more precise algorithm, which yields a substantial gain in performance, as shown in our experimental evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Aina Niemetz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niemetz:Aina", "Mathias Preiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Preiner:Mathias", "Armin Biere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biere:Armin"], "pages": 19}
