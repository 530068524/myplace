{"title": "Melange: space folding for multi-focus interaction.", "fields": ["split screen", "visualization", "paging", "zoom", "distortion"], "abstract": "Interaction and navigation in large geometric spaces typically require a sequence of pan and zoom actions. This strategy is often ineffective and cumbersome, especially when trying to study several distant objects. We propose a new distortion technique that folds the intervening space to guarantee visibility of multiple focus regions. The folds themselves show contextual information and support unfolding and paging interactions. Compared to previous work, our method provides more context and distance awareness. We conducted a study comparing the space-folding technique to existing approaches, and found that participants performed significantly better with the new technique.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Sydney", "University of Queensland", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Niklas Elmqvist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elmqvist:Niklas", "Nathalie Henry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henry:Nathalie", "Yann Riche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riche:Yann", "Jean-Daniel Fekete.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fekete:Jean=Daniel"], "pages": 10}
