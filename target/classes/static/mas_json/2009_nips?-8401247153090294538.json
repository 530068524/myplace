{"title": "Ensemble Nystrom Method.", "fields": ["data set", "nystrom method", "exponential function", "scaling", "kernel method"], "abstract": "A crucial technique for scaling kernel methods to very large data sets reaching or exceeding millions of instances is based on low-rank approximation of kernel matrices. We introduce a new family of algorithms based on mixtures of Nystrom approximations, ensemble Nystrom algorithms, that yield more accurate low-rank approximations than the standard Nystrom method. We give a detailed study of variants of these algorithms based on simple averaging, an exponential weight method, or regression-based methods. We also present a theoretical analysis of these algorithms, including novel error bounds guaranteeing a better convergence rate than the standard Nystrom method. Finally, we report results of extensive experiments with several data sets containing up to 1M points demonstrating the significant improvement over the standard Nystrom approximation.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Google", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Sanjiv Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Sanjiv", "Mehryar Mohri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohri:Mehryar", "Ameet Talwalkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talwalkar:Ameet"], "pages": 9}
