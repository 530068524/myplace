Designed to complement an existing water fountain with projected light and sound, the embedded installation encouraged people to take a drink, increasing the proportion of people who used the water fountain by 42% to 57% approximately for nine months. Sensors evaluated the impact of multiple interaction modalities on actual water usage. We found that subtle interaction can improve the experience of a space, in particular for those that use it frequently, and lead to sustained behavior change, especially when its modalities are responsive to the level of activity in the space.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Pompeu Fabra University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Pompeu Fabra University"], "authors": ["Ernesto Arroyo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arroyo:Ernesto", "Leonardo Bonanni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonanni:Leonardo", "Nina Valkanova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valkanova:Nina"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
