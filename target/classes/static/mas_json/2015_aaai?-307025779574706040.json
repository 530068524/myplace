{"title": "TrustSVD: Collaborative Filtering with Both the Explicit and Implicit Influence of User Trust and of Item Ratings.", "fields": ["data set", "singular value decomposition", "matrix decomposition", "recommender system", "collaborative filtering"], "abstract": "Collaborative filtering suffers from the problems of data sparsity and cold start, which dramatically degrade recommendation performance. To help resolve these issues, we propose TrustSVD, a trust-based matrix factorization technique. By analyzing the social trust data from four real-world data sets, we conclude that not only the explicit but also the implicit influence of both ratings and trust should be taken into consideration in a recommendation model. Hence, we build on top of a state-of-the-art recommendation algorithm SVD++ which inherently involves the explicit and implicit influence of rated items, by further incorporating both the explicit and implicit influence of trusted users on the prediction of items for an active user. To our knowledge, the work reported is the first to extend SVD++ with social trust information. Experimental results on the four data sets demonstrate that our approach TrustSVD achieves better accuracy than other ten counterparts, and can better handle the concerned issues.", "citation": "Citations (149)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "American University of Beirut"], "authors": ["Guibing Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Guibing", "Jie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Jie", "Neil Yorke-Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yorke=Smith:Neil"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
