This goal is achieved by automatically leveraging comments written by professional and knowledgeable photographers in specialized community websites. The statistical analysis of the resulting data shows the importance of multiple visual attributes in aesthetic perception, and their interaction effects with different photography categories. This technique can be applied in personalization and ranking of search results, and has the potential to reveal relevant factors in other domains.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 San Pedro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedro:Jos=eacute=_San", "Poonam Suryanarayan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suryanarayan:Poonam"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
