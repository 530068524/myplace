We combine (i) features on sourceside syntactic subcategorization and (ii) an external knowledge base with quantitative, dependency-based information about target-side subcategorization frames. A manual evaluation of an English-toGerman translation task shows that the subcategorization information has a positive impact on translation quality through better prediction of case.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Marion Weller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weller:Marion", "Alexander M.
