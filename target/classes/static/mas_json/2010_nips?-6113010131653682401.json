{"title": "A Discriminative Latent Model of Image Region and Object Tag Correspondence.", "fields": ["probabilistic latent semantic analysis", "training set", "discriminative model", "annotation", "latent variable"], "abstract": "We propose a discriminative latent model for annotating images with unaligned object-level textual annotations. Instead of using the bag-of-words image representation currently popular in the computer vision community, our model explicitly captures more intricate relationships underlying visual and textual information. In particular, we model the mapping that translates image regions to annotations. This mapping allows us to relate image regions to their corresponding annotation terms. We also model the overall scene label as latent information. This allows us to cluster test images. Our training data consist of images and their associated annotations. But we do not have access to the ground-truth region-to-annotation mapping or the overall scene label. We develop a novel variant of the latent SVM framework to model them as latent variables. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with other baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Yang", "Greg Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Greg"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
