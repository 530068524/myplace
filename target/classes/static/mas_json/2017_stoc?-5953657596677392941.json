This cooperative game is played by two players, Alice and Bob: Alice picks a distribution \ufffd  over the numbers {1,\u00e2 \ufffd, n }, and announces it to Bob. She then chooses a number  x  according to \ufffd , and Bob attempts to identify  x  using as few Yes/No queries as possible, on average. An optimal strategy for the \"20 questions\" game is given by a Huffman code for \ufffd : Bob\u00e2  s questions reveal the codeword for  x  bit by bit. This strategy finds  x  using fewer than  H (\ufffd )+1 questions on average. However, the questions asked by Bob could be arbitrary. In this paper, we investigate the following question: *Are there restricted sets of questions that match the performance of Huffman codes, either exactly or approximately?* Our first main result shows that for every distribution \ufffd , Bob has a strategy that uses only questions of the form \" x   c ?\" and \" x  =  c ?\", and uncovers  x  using at most  H (\ufffd )+1 questions on average, matching the performance of Huffman codes in this sense. We also give a natural set of  O ( rn  1/ r  ) questions that achieve a performance of at most  H (\ufffd )+ r , and show that I\u00a9( rn  1/ r  ) questions are required to achieve such a guarantee. Our second main result gives a set  Q  of 1.25  n + o ( n )  questions such that for every distribution \ufffd , Bob can implement an  optimal  strategy for \ufffd  using only questions from  Q . We also show that 1.25  n \u00e2   o ( n )  questions are needed, for infinitely many  n . If we allow a small slack of  r  over the optimal strategy, then roughly ( rn ) I (1/ r )  questions are necessary and sufficient.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of California, San Diego", "Zerocoin Electronic Coin, USA"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yuval Dagan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dagan:Yuval", "Yuval Filmus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filmus:Yuval", "Ariel Gabizon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gabizon:Ariel", "Shay Moran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moran:Shay"], "pages": 13}
