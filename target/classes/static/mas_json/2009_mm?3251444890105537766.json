{"title": "Generating location overviews with images and tags by mining user-generated travelogues.", "fields": ["virtual tour", "user interface", "multimedia", "world wide web", "user generated content"], "abstract": "Automatically generating location overviews in the form of both visual and textual descriptions is highly desired for online services such as travel planning, to provide attractive and comprehensive outlines of travel destinations. Actually, user-generated content (e.g., travelogues) on the Web provides abundant information to various aspects (e.g., landmarks, styles, activities) of most locations in the world. To leverage the experience shared by Web users, in this paper we propose a location overview generation approach, which first mines location-representative tags from travelogues and then uses such tags to retrieve web images. The learnt tags and retrieved images are finally presented via a novel user interface which provides an informative overview for a given location. Experimental results based on 23,756 travelogues and evaluation over 20 locations show promising results on both travelogue mining and location overview generation.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["Tianjin University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Tianjin University"], "authors": ["Qiang Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Qiang", "Rui Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Rui", "Xin-Jing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xin=Jing", "Jiang-Ming Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jiang=Ming", "Yanwei Pang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pang:Yanwei", "Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lei"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
