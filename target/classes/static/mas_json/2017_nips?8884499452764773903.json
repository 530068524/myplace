{"title": "Adaptive Active Hypothesis Testing under Limited Information.", "fields": ["bayesian probability", "special case", "sample size determination", "sequential analysis", "active learning"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of active sequential hypothesis testing where a Bayesian decision maker must infer the true hypothesis from a set of hypotheses. The decision maker may choose for a set of actions, where the outcome of an action is corrupted by independent noise. In this paper we consider a special case where the decision maker has limited knowledge about the distribution of observations for each action, in that only a binary value is observed. Our objective is to infer the true hypothesis with low error, while minimizing the number of action sampled. Our main results include the derivation of a lower bound on sample size for our system under limited knowledge and the design of an active learning policy that matches this lower bound and outperforms similar known algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Bell Labs"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Fabio Cecchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cecchi:Fabio", "Nidhi Hegde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hegde:Nidhi"], "pages": 9}
