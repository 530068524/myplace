{"title": "HeadPhones: Ad Hoc Mobile Multi-Display Environments through Head Tracking.", "fields": ["reference frame", "fiducial marker", "headphones", "mobile device", "augmented reality"], "abstract": "We present HeadPhones (Headtracking + smartPhones), a novel approach for the spatial registration of multiple mobile devices into an ad hoc multi-display environment. We propose to employ the user's head as external reference frame for the registration of multiple mobile devices into a common coordinate system. Our approach allows for dynamic repositioning of devices during runtime without the need for external infrastructure such as separate cameras or fiducials. Specifically, our only requirements are local network connections and mobile devices with built-in front facing cameras. This way, HeadPhones enables spatially-aware multi-display applications in mobile contexts. A user study and accuracy evaluation indicate the feasibility of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Passau", "Coburg Universi ...
