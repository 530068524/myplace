{"title": "Scalable Instance Reconstruction in Knowledge Bases via Relatedness Affiliated Embedding.", "fields": ["reduction", "computation", "scalability", "embedding", "reconstruction algorithm"], "abstract": "The knowledge base (KB) completion problem is usually formulated as a link prediction problem. Such formulation is incapable of capturing certain application scenarios when the KB contains multi-fold relations. In this paper, we present a new class  of KB completion problems, called instance reconstruction, complementing the scope of link prediction. Unlike its link-prediction counterpart, which has linear complexity in KB size, this problem has its complexity behave as a high-degree polynomial. This presents significant challenges in developing scalable reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we present a novel KB embedding model (RAE) and build on it an instance reconstruction algorithm (SIR). The SIR algorithm utilizes schema-based filtering as well as \u201crelatedness\u201d filtering for complexity reduction.  Here relatedness refers to the likelihood that two entities co-participate in a common instance, and the relatedness metric is learned from the RAE model. We show experimentally that SIR significantly reduces computation complexity without sacrificing reconstruction performance. The complexity reduction corresponds to reducing the KB size by 100 to 1000 folds.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University", "University of Ottawa"], "authors": ["Richong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Richong", "Junpeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Junpeng", "Jiajie Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Jiajie", "Yongyi Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Yongyi"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
