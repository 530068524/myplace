Efficient algorithms are known for computing interpolants in rational and real linear arithmetic. We focus on subsets of integer linear arithmetic. Our main results are polynomial time algorithms for obtaining interpolants for conjunctions of linear diophantine equations, linear modular equations (linear congruences), and linear diophantine disequations. We show the utility of the proposed interpolation algorithms for discovering  modular/divisibility predicates in a counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) framework. This has enabled verification of simple programs that cannot be checked using existing CEGAR based model checkers.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Synopsys", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Himanshu Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Himanshu", "Edmund M.
