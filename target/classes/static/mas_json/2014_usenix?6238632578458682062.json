{"title": "SCFS: A Shared Cloud-backed File System.", "fields": ["dependability", "file sharing", "cloud storage", "modular design", "strong consistency"], "abstract": "Despite of their rising popularity, current cloud storage services and cloud-backed storage systems still have some limitations related to reliability, durability assurances and inefficient file sharing. We present SCFS, a cloud-backed file system that addresses these issues and provides strong consistency and near-POSIX semantics on top of eventually-consistent cloud storage services. SCFS provides a pluggable backplane that allows it to work with various storage clouds or a cloud-of-clouds (for added dependability). It also exploits some design opportunities inherent in the current cloud services through a set of novel ideas for cloud-backed file systems: always write and avoid reading, modular coordination, private name spaces and consistency anchors.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "departments": ["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias, LaSIGE", "Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias, LaSIGE", "Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias, LaSIGE", "Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias, LaSIGE"], "authors": ["Alysson Neves Bessani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bessani:Alysson_Neves", "Ricardo Mendes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mendes:Ricardo", "Tiago Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveira:Tiago", "Nuno Ferreira Neves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neves:Nuno_Ferreira", "Miguel Correia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Correia_0001:Miguel", "Marcelo Pasin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasin:Marcelo", "Paulo Ver\u00edssimo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Ver=iacute=ssimo:Paulo"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
