{"title": "MON: Mission-optimized overlay networks.", "fields": ["local area network", "voice over ip", "maximization", "overlay network", "overlay"], "abstract": "Large organizations often have users in multiple sites which are connected over the Internet. Since resources are limited, communication between these sites needs to be carefully orchestrated for the most benefit to the organization. We present a Mission-optimized Overlay Network (MON), a hybrid overlay network architecture for maximizing utility to the organization. We combine an offline and an online system to solve non-concave utility maximization problems. The offline tier, the Predictive Flow Optimizer (PFO), creates plans for routing traffic using a model of network conditions. The online tier, MONtra, is aware of the precise local network conditions and is able to react quickly to problems within the network. Either tier alone is insufficient. The PFO may take too long to react to network changes. MONtra only has local information and cannot optimize non-concave mission utilities. However, by combining the two systems, MON is robust and achieves near-optimal utility under a wide range of network conditions. While best-effort overlay networks are well studied, our work is the first to design overlays that are optimized for mission utility.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["BAE Systems", "College of Info ... herst, MA 01003", "College of Info ... herst, MA 01003", "College of Info ... herst, MA 01003", "College of Info ... herst, MA 01003"], "authors": ["Bruce Spang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spang:Bruce", "Anirudh Sabnis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabnis:Anirudh", "Ramesh K.
