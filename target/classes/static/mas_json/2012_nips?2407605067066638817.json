Regression analysis has been studied to relate neuroimaging measures to cognitive status. However, whether these measures have further predictive power to infer a trajectory of cognitive performance over time is still an under-explored but important topic in AD research. We propose a novel high-order multi-task learning model to address this issue. The proposed model explores the temporal correlations existing in imaging and cognitive data by structured sparsity-inducing norms. The sparsity of the model enables the selection of a small number of imaging measures while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The empirical studies, using the longitudinal imaging and cognitive data of the ADNI cohort, have yielded promising results.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "Indiana University", "Indiana University"], "authors": ["Hua Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hua", "Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Heng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Heng", "Jingwen Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Jingwen", "Sungeun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sungeun", "Shannon L.
