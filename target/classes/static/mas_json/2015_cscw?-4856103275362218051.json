It is developing software tools to help remote rural communities to collaboratively maintain and present information about their cultural heritage. The objective is to investigate the use of semantic web/linked data technology to build a general, flexible and \"future proof\" software platform that could help such projects to develop digital archives and to be sustainable over time. As an interdisciplinary project we aim to synthesise a narrative that draws from both social science and computer science perspectives by critically reflecting upon the novel approach taken and the on-going results that are being produced.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Aberdeen", "University of Aberdeen", "University of Aberdeen", "University of Aberdeen", "University of Aberdeen", "Computing Science", "Computing Science", "Computing Science"], "authors": ["Gemma Webster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Webster:Gemma", "Hai H.
