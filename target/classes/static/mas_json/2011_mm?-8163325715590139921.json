The innovative contribution of the 'Wonderlands' system is threefold: first, its use of an understanding of real-world physical entities depicted in images in terms of size and scale to filter images for display to the user; second, its application of our recently proposed 'Reading between the Tags' approach, which infers the real-world size of physical objects depicted in images by combining user-assigned image tags and natural language statistics mined from the Web; and, third, its trim realization of an engaging application that is implemented in a light-weight manner such that it can be executed as a live extension to the Flickr search engine. Results of a simple system-oriented evaluation support the conclusion that 'Wonderlands' reaches its aim of presenting users with images sorted with respect to the size- and scale-characteristics of their visually depicted content.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Christoph Kofler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kofler:Christoph", "Martha Larson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larson:Martha", "Alan Hanjalic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanjalic:Alan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
