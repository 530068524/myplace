{"title": "Reasoning with Knowledge, Action and Time in Dynamic and Uncertain Domains.", "fields": ["accessibility relation", "expressivity", "correctness", "event calculus", "possible world"], "abstract": "We propose a new framework for reasoning about knowledge, action and time for domains that include actions with non-deterministic and context-dependent effects. The axiomatization is based on the Event Calculus and combines the expressiveness of possible worlds semantics with the efficiency of approaches that dispense the use of the accessibility relation. The framework is proved logically sound and, when restricted to deterministic domains, is also logically complete. To prove correctness of the approach, we construct a knowledge theory based on a branching version of the Event Calculus and study their correlation.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Foundation for Research & Technology \u2013 Hellas", "Foundation for Research & Technology \u2013 Hellas"], "authors": ["Theodore Patkos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patkos:Theodore", "Dimitris Plexousakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plexousakis:Dimitris"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
