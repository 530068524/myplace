Besides performance advantage on certain platforms, such a design allows for more efficient masking techniques that can mitigate side-channel attacks with a small performance overhead.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "University of Haifa", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Bar-Ilan University", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Achiya Bar-On.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bar=On:Achiya", "Itai Dinur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinur:Itai", "Orr Dunkelman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunkelman:Orr", "Virginie Lallemand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lallemand:Virginie", "Nathan Keller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keller:Nathan", "Boaz Tsaban.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsaban:Boaz"], "pages": 28}
