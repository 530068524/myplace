How can these features be exploited in datacenter-scale systems infrastructure? In this paper, we explore the design of a distributed in-memory key-value store called Pilaf that takes advantage of Remote Direct Memory Access to achieve high performance with low CPU overhead.\n\nIn Pilaf, clients directly read from the server's memory via RDMA to perform gets, which commonly dominate key-value store workloads. By contrast, put operations are serviced by the server to simplify the task of synchronizing memory accesses. To detect inconsistent RDMA reads with concurrent CPU memory modifications, we introduce the notion of self-verifying data structures that can detect read-write races without client-server coordination. Our experiments show that Pilaf achieves low latency and high throughput while consuming few CPU resources. Specifically, Pilaf can surpass 1.3 million ops/sec (90% gets) using a single CPU core compared with 55K for Memcached and 59K for Redis.", "citation": "Citations (199)", "departments": ["New York University", "Tsinghua University", "New York University"], "authors": ["Christopher Mitchell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitchell:Christopher", "Yifeng Geng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geng:Yifeng", "Jinyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Jinyang"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
