Given a query variable and a large graphical model, we define a much smaller model in a local region around the query variable in the target model so that the marginal distribution of the query variable can be accurately approximated. We introduce two approximation error bounds based on the Dobrushin's comparison theorem and apply our bounds to derive a greedy expansion algorithm that efficiently guides the selection of neighbor nodes for localized inference. We verify our theoretical bounds on various datasets and demonstrate that our localized inference algorithm can provide fast and accurate approximation for large graphical models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Jinglin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jinglin", "Jian Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Jian", "Qiang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qiang"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
