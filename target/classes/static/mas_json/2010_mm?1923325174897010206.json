Transcoding and packet dropping are used as examples of rate adaptation schemes, and we investigate their impact on user perceived video quality. In the presence of constrained computation resources, the most suitable rate adaptation scheme is determined for each video stream such that the overall quality degradation is minimized. The proposed scheme selection approach is integrated with QoE-based resource allocation in presence of constrained transmission resources. Simulation results obtained from an emulated High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) show that the QoE-based approach leads to significant improvements of user perceived quality compared to other approaches including a non-optimized HSDPA systems", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Srisakul Thakolsri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thakolsri:Srisakul", "Wolfgang Kellerer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kellerer:Wolfgang", "Eckehard G.
