{"title": "Is Approval Voting Optimal Given Approval Votes?", "fields": ["bullet voting", "approval voting", "cardinal voting systems", "anti plurality voting", "disapproval voting"], "abstract": "Some crowdsourcing platforms ask workers to express their opinions by approving a set of k good alternatives. It seems that the only reasonable way to aggregate these k-approval votes is the approval voting rule, which simply counts the number of times each alternative was approved. We challenge this assertion by proposing a probabilistic framework of noisy voting, and asking whether approval voting yields an alternative that is most likely to be the best alternative, given k-approval votes. While the answer is generally positive, our theoretical and empirical results call attention to situations where approval voting is suboptimal.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ariel D.
