In the prevalent framework for creating such presentations, layouts are supplied to the user in the form of designed templates. However, a template library may not support a desired number of photos, combination of aspect ratios or range of areas. To alleviate this issue, we present BRIC, a method for arranging practically any number of photos on a rectangular canvas. Primary constraints ensure respect of photo aspect ratios and specified gutter thickness; while secondary constraints encourage layouts in which photo areas correspond to desired relative area values. Photos are arranged based on a recursive partition of the page, with photo areas computed as the solution to a linear system implied by the partition. We present a detailed description of BRIC along with examples that demonstrate its versatility.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Clayton Brian Atkins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atkins:Clayton_Brian"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
