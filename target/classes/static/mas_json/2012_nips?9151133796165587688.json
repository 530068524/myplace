Kernel density plug-in estimators are simple, easy to implement and widely used for estimation of entropy. However, for large feature dimension d, kernel plug-in estimators suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the MSE rate of convergence is glacially slow - of order O(T-\u03b3/d), where T is the number of samples, and \u03b3 > 0 is a rate parameter. In this paper, it is shown that for sufficiently smooth densities, an ensemble of kernel plug-in estimators can be combined via a weighted convex combination, such that the resulting weighted estimator has a superior parametric MSE rate of convergence of order O(T-1). Furthermore, it is shown that these optimal weights can be determined by solving a convex optimization problem which does not require training data or knowledge of the underlying density, and therefore can be performed offline. This novel result is remarkable in that, while each of the individual kernel plug-in estimators belonging to the ensemble suffer from the curse of dimensionality, by appropriate ensemble averaging we can achieve parametric convergence rates.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Kumar Sricharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sricharan:Kumar", "Alfred O.
