However, little work has been done on examining or empowering the discriminative ability of DGMs on making accurate predictions. This paper presents max-margin deep generative models (mmDGMs), which explore the strongly discriminative principle of max-margin learning to improve the discriminative power of DGMs, while retaining the generative capability. We develop an efficient doubly stochastic subgradient algorithm for the piecewise linear objective. Empirical results on MNIST and SVHN datasets demonstrate that (1) max-margin learning can significantly improve the prediction performance of DGMs and meanwhile retain the generative ability; and (2) mmDGMs are competitive to the state-of-the-art fully discriminative networks by employing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as both recognition and generative models.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Stanford University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Chongxuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chongxuan", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Tianlin Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Tianlin", "Bo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0010:Bo"], "pages": 9}
