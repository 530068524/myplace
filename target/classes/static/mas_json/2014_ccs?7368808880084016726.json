We show that, given a desired degree ofgeo-indistinguishability, it is possible to construct a mechanism that minimizes the service quality loss, using linear programming techniques. In addition we show that, under certain conditions, such mechanism also provides optimal privacy in the sense of Shokri et al. Furthermore, we propose a method to reduce the number of constraints of the linear program from cubic to quadratic, maintaining the privacy guarantees and without affecting significantly the utility of the generated mechanism. This reduces considerably the time required to solve the linear program, thus enlarging significantly the location sets for which the optimal mechanisms can be computed.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Nicol\u00e1s Emilio Bordenabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bordenabe:Nicol=aacute=s_Emilio", "Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatzikokolakis_0001:Konstantinos", "Catuscia Palamidessi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palamidessi:Catuscia"], "pages": 12}
