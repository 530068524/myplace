In order to achieve a breakthrough, many research groups are now investigating new methodologies that have potential to outperform the Hidden Markov Model technology that is at the core of all present commercial systems. In this paper, it is shown that the recently introduced concept of Reservoir Computing might form the basis of such a methodology. In a limited amount of time, a reservoir system that can recognize the elementary sounds of continuous speech has been built. The system already achieves a state-of-the-art performance, and there is evidence that the margin for further improvements is still significant.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "departments": ["Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University"], "authors": ["Fabian Triefenbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Triefenbach:Fabian", "Azarakhsh Jalalvand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jalalvand:Azarakhsh", "Benjamin Schrauwen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schrauwen:Benjamin", "Jean-Pierre Martens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martens:Jean=Pierre"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
