There has been much interest in studying SLS algorithms on random k-SAT instances. Compared to random 3-SAT instances which have special statistical properties rendering them easy to solve, random k-SAT instances with long clauses are similar to structured ones and remain very difficult. This paper is devoted to efficient SLS algorithms for random k-SAT instances with long clauses. By combining a novel variable property subscore with the commonly used property score, we design a scoring function named comprehensive score, which is utilized to develop a new SLS algorithm called CScoreSAT. The experiments show that CScoreSAT outperforms state-of-the-art SLS solvers, including the winners of recent SAT competitions, by one to two orders of magnitudes on large random 5-SAT and 7-SAT instances. In addition, CScoreSAT significantly outperforms its competitors on random k-SAT instances for each k = 4; 5; 6; 7 from SAT Challenge 2012, which indicates its robustness.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Shaowei Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Shaowei", "Kaile Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Kaile"], "pages": 7}
