Given two well-trained networks that may have different architectures that handle different tasks, our method aligns the layers of the original networks and merges them into a unified model by sharing the representative codes of weights. The shared weights are further re-trained to fine-tune the performance of the merged model. The proposed method effectively produces a compact model that may run original tasks simultaneously on resource-limited devices. As it preserves the general architectures and leverages the co-used weights of well-trained networks, a substantial training overhead can be reduced to shorten the system development time. Experimental results demonstrate a satisfactory performance and validate the effectiveness of the method.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "AmeriCorps VISTA", "Academia Sinica", "AmeriCorps VISTA", "Academia Sinica", "AmeriCorps VISTA", "National Chiayi University", "Academia Sinica", "AmeriCorps VISTA"], "authors": ["Yi-Min Chou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chou:Yi=Min", "Yi-Ming Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Yi=Ming", "Jia-Hong Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jia=Hong", "Chih-Yi Chiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiu:Chih=Yi", "Chu-Song Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chu=Song"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
