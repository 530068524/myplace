By representing textual documents as graph-of-words instead of historical n-gram bag-of-words, we extract more discriminative features that correspond to long-distance n-grams through frequent subgraph mining. Moreover, by capitalizing on the concept of k-core, we reduce the graph representation to its densest part \u2013 its main core \u2013 speeding up the feature extraction step for little to no cost in prediction performances. Experiments on four standard text classification datasets show statistically significant higher accuracy and macro-averaged F1-score compared to baseline approaches.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Rousseau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rousseau_0001:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Emmanouil Kiagias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiagias:Emmanouil", "Michalis Vazirgiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vazirgiannis:Michalis"], "pages": 11}
