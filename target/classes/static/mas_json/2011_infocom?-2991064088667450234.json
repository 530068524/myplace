{"title": "Defending against vehicular rogue APs.", "fields": ["rogue access point", "rss", "adversary", "private information retrieval", "path loss"], "abstract": "This paper considers vehicular rogue access points (APs) that rogue APs are set up in moving vehicles to mimic legitimate roadside APs to lure users to associate to them. Due to its mobility, a vehicular rogue AP is able to maintain a long connection with users. Thus, the adversary has more time to launch various attacks to steal users' private information. We propose a practical detection scheme based on the comparison of Receive Signal Strength (RSS) to prevent users from connecting to rogue APs. The basic idea of our solution is to force APs (both legitimate and fake) to report their GPS locations and transmission powers in beacons. Based on such information, users can validate whether the measured RSS matches the value estimated from the AP's location, transmission power, and its own GPS location. Furthermore, we consider the impact of path loss and shadowing and propose a method based on rate adaption to deal with advanced rogue APs. We implemented our detection technique on commercial off-the-shelf devices including wireless cards, antennas, and GPS modules to evaluate the efficacy of our scheme.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Hao Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Hao", "Fengyuan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Fengyuan", "Chiu Chiang Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chiu_Chiang", "Yifan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Yifan", "Qun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
