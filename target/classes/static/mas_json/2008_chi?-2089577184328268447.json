As a first step towards realizing the mu-CI concept, we conducted an experiment to explore the potential of exploiting muscular sensing and processing technologies for muCIs. We present results demonstrating accurate gesture classification with an off-the-shelf electromyography (EMG) device. Specifically, using 10 sensors worn in a narrow band around the upper forearm, we were able to differentiate position and pressure of finger presses, as well as classify tapping and lifting gestures across all five fingers. We conclude with discussion of the implications of our results for future muCI designs.", "citation": "Citations (198)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["T.
