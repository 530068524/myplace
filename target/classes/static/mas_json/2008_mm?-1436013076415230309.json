Taking photos is then often an inevitable and frequent event during one's trip for recording the enjoyable experience. To help people to relive the wonderful travel experience they had recorded in photos, this paper presents a system, Photo Navigator, for enhancing the photo browsing experience by creating a new browsing style with a realistic feel to users as being into the scenes and taking a trip back in time to revisit the place. The proposed system is characterized by two main features. First, it better reveals the spatial relations among photos and offers a strong sense of space by taking users to fly into the scenes. Second, it is fully automatic and makes plausible for novice users to utilize the 3D technologies that are traditionally complex to manipulate. The proposed system is compared with two other photo browsing tools, ACDSee's photo slideshow and Microsoft's PhotoStory. User studies show that people would comparatively favor the browsing style we offer and appreciate the ease to create such a style.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Chi-Chang Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Chi=Chang", "Wen-Huang Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wen=Huang", "Chia-Hu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Chia=Hu", "Yung-Yu Chuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuang:Yung=Yu", "Ja-Ling Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ja=Ling"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
