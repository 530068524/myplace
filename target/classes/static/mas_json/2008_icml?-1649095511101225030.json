{"title": "An analysis of linear models, linear value-function approximation, and feature selection for reinforcement learning.", "fields": ["approximation error", "linear approximation", "bellman equation", "log linear model", "reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "We show that linear value-function approximation is equivalent to a form of linear model approximation. We then derive a relationship between the model-approximation error and the Bellman error, and show how this relationship can guide feature selection for model improvement and/or value-function improvement. We also show how these results give insight into the behavior of existing feature-selection algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Duke University", "Rutgers University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ronald Parr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parr:Ronald", "Lihong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Lihong", "Gavin Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor:Gavin", "Christopher Painter-Wakefield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Painter=Wakefield:Christopher", "Michael L.
