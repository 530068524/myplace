This case study describes the various efforts that went into the election--including the improved design and implementation of the voting system, streamlined procedures, agreements with the city, and assessments of the experiences of voters and poll workers.\n\nThe election, with 1728 voters from six wards, involved paper ballots with invisible-ink confirmation codes, instant-runoff voting with write-ins, early and absentee (mail-in) voting, dual-language ballots, provisional ballots, privacy sleeves, any-which-way scanning with parallel conventional desktop scanners, end-to-end verifiability based on optional web-based voter verification of votes cast, a full hand recount, thresholded authorities, three independent outside auditors, fully-disclosed software, and exit surveys for voters and pollworkers.\n\nDespite some glitches, the use of Scantegrity II was a success, demonstrating that E2E cryptographic voting systems can be effectively used and accepted by the general public.", "citation": "Citations (116)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Richard Carback.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carback:Richard", "David Chaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaum:David", "Jeremy Clark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clark:Jeremy", "John Conway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conway:John", "Aleksander Essex.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Essex:Aleksander", "Paul S.
