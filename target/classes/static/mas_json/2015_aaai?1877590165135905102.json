However, most existing keypoint trackers are incapable of effectively modeling and balancing the following three aspects in a simultaneous manner: temporal model coherence across frames, spatial model consistency within frames, and discriminative feature construction. To address this issue, we propose a robust keypoint tracker based on spatio-temporal multi-task structured output optimization driven by discriminative metric learning. Consequently, temporal model coherence is characterized by multi-task structured keypoint model learning over several adjacent frames, while spatial model consistency is modeled by solving a geometric verification based structured learning problem. Discriminative feature construction is enabled by metric learning to ensure the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Finally, the above three modules are simultaneously optimized in a joint learning scheme. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our tracker.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Liming Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Liming", "Xi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xi", "Jun Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao_0001:Jun", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
