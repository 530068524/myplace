The most challenging task within the sentence regression framework is to identify discriminative features to encode a sentence into a feature vector. So far, sentence regression approaches have neglected to use features that capture contextual relations among sentences.   We propose a neural network model, Contextual Relation-based Summarization (CRSum), to take advantage of contextual relations among sentences so as to improve the performance of sentence regression. Specifically, we first use sentence relations with a word-level attentive pooling convolutional neural network to construct sentence representations. Then, we use contextual relations with a sentence-level attentive pooling recurrent neural network to construct context representations. Finally, CRSum automatically learns useful contextual features by jointly learning representations of sentences and similarity scores between a sentence and sentences in its context. Using a two-level attention mechanism, CRSum is able to pay attention to important content, i.e., words and sentences, in the surrounding context of a given sentence.   We carry out extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets. CRSum alone can achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art approaches; when combined with a few basic surface features, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of multiple ROUGE metrics.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Microsoft", "Shandong University", "JD.com, Beijing, China"], "authors": ["Pengjie Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Pengjie", "Zhumin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhumin", "Zhaochun Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Zhaochun", "Furu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Furu", "Jun Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma_0001:Jun", "Maarten de Rijke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rijke:Maarten_de"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
