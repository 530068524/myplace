{"title": "Optimized query evaluation using cooperative sorts.", "fields": ["selection sort", "adaptive sort", "counting sort", "timsort", "tree sort"], "abstract": "Many applications require sorting a table over multiple sort orders: generation of multiple reports from a table, evaluation of a complex query that involves multiple instances of a relation, and batch processing of a set of queries. In this paper, we study how multiple sortings of a table can be efficiently performed. We introduce a new evaluation technique, called cooperative sort, that exploits the relationships among the input set of sort orders to minimize I/O operations for the collection of sort operations. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme, we implemented it in PostgreSQL and evaluated its performance using both TPC-DS benchmark and synthetic data. Our experimental results show significant performance improvement over the traditional non-cooperative sorting scheme.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yu Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yu", "Ramadhana Bramandia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bramandia:Ramadhana", "Chee-Yong Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Chee=Yong", "Kian-Lee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian=Lee"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
