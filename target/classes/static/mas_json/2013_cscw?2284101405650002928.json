In this paper, we explore the social and psychological predictors of volunteer socializers on reddit, an online social news-sharing community. Through a survey of over 1000 reddit users, we found that social identity, prosocial-orientation and generalized reciprocity are all predictors of socializers in the community. Interestingly, a user's tenure with the online community has a quadratic effect on volunteer socialization behaviors -- new and long-time members are both more likely to help newcomers than those in between. We conclude with design implications for motivating users to help newcomers.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Gary Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Gary", "Youyang Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:Youyang", "Ian Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ian", "Khai N.
