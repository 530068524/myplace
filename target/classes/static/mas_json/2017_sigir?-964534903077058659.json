{"title": "Social Media Advertisement Outreach: Learning the Role of Aesthetics.", "fields": ["multimedia", "social media", "advertising", "outreach", "marketing strategy"], "abstract": "Corporations spend millions of dollars on developing creative image based promotional content to advertise to their user-base on platforms like Twitter. Our paper is an initial study, where we propose a novel method to evaluate and improve outreach of promotional images from corporations on Twitter, based purely on their describable aesthetic attributes. Existing works in aesthetic based image analysis exclusively focus on the attributes of digital photographs, and are not applicable to advertisements due to the influences of inherent content and context based biases on outreach. Our paper identifies broad categories of biases affecting such images, describes a method for normalizing outreach scores to eliminate effects of those biases, which enables us to subsequently examine the effects of certain handcrafted describable aesthetic features on image outreach. Optimizing on the features resulting from this research is a simple method for corporations to complement their existing marketing strategy to gain significant improvement in user engagement on social media for promotional images.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Harvard University", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"], "authors": ["Avikalp Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Avikalp", "Madhav Datt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Datt:Madhav", "Jaikrishna Chaparala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaparala:Jaikrishna", "Shubham Mangla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mangla:Shubham", "Priyadarshi Patnaik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patnaik:Priyadarshi"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
