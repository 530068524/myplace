The most surprising system is the \"fixed unstructured B-0 Rabin-williams\" system, which has a tight security proof despite hashing unrandomized messages.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Daniel J.
