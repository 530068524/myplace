Previous methods often analyze the consistency between different EGs, and regard the largest subset of self-consistent EGs as correct. However, as demonstrated in [14], such a largest self-consistent set often corresponds to incorrect result, especially when there are duplicate structures in the scene. We propose a novel optimization criteria based on the idea of \u2018missing correspondences\u2019. The global minimum of our optimization objective function is associated with the correct solution. We then design an efficient algorithm for minimization, whose convergence to a local minimum is guaranteed. Experimental results show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Nianjuan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Nianjuan", "Ping Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Ping", "Loong Fah Cheong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheong:Loong_Fah"], "pages": 8}
