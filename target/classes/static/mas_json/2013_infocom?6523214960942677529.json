Given the complex interactions between policies in the Internet, the origin AS by itself cannot ensure that only by configuring a routing policy it can also achieve the anticipated results. Moreover, the definition of routing policies is a complicated process, involving a number of subtle tuning operations prone to errors. In this paper, we propose the BGP Visibility Scanner which allows network operators to validate the correct implementation of their routing policies, by corroborating the BGP routing information from approximatively 130 independent observation points in the Internet. We exemplify the use of the proposed methodology and also perform an initial validation for the BGP Visibility Scanner capabilities through various real operational use cases.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["IMDEA Networks", "Carlos III Health Institute", "Loughborough University"], "authors": ["Andra Lutu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutu:Andra", "Marcelo Bagnulo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagnulo:Marcelo", "Olaf Maennel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maennel:Olaf"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
