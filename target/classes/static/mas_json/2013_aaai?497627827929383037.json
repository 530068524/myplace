In this paper, we extend traditional non-negative tensor factorization into a supervised discriminative decomposition, referred as Supervised Non-negative Tensor Factorization with Maximum-Margin Constraint (SNTFM2). SNTFM2 formulates the optimal discriminative factorization of non-negative tensorial data as a coupled least-squares optimization problem via a maximum-margin method. As a result, SNTFM2 not only faithfully approximates the tensorial data by additive combinations of the basis, but also obtains a strong generalization power to discriminative analysis (in particular for classification in this paper). The experimental results show the superiority of our proposed model over state-of-the-art techniques on both toy and real world data sets.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "University of Queensland", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Xu Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Xu", "Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Yi", "Dacheng Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Dacheng", "Siliang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Siliang", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
