We show that every communication protocol that communicates  C  bits and reveals  I  bits of information about the participants\u2019 private inputs to an observer that watches the communication, can be simulated by a new protocol that communicates at most  poly ( I ) \u00b7 loglog( C ) bits. Our result is tight up to polynomial factors, as it matches the recent work separating communication complexity from external information cost.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Mark Braverman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braverman:Mark", "Gillat Kol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kol:Gillat"], "pages": 14}
