Most existing trackers only consider the pairwise interactions between samples, and thereby ignore the higher-order contextual interactions, which may lead to the sensitivity to complicated factors such as noises, outliers, background clutters and so on. In this paper, we propose a visual tracker based on support vector machines (SVMs), for which a novel graph mode-based contextual kernel is designed to effectively capture the higher-order contextual information from samples. To do so, we first create a visual graph whose similarity matrix is determined by a baseline visual kernel. Second, a set of high-order contexts are discovered in the visual graph. The problem of discovering these high-order contexts is solved by seeking modes of the visual graph. Each graph mode corresponds to a vertex community termed as a high-order context. Third, we construct a contextual kernel that effectively captures the interaction information between the high-order contexts. Finally, this contextual kernel is embedded into SVMs for robust tracking. Experimental results on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "Xiamen University", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Xi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xi", "Anthony R.
