However, there are few studies that document how specific remembrance or support features of bereavement websites are used in a real-world setting. This paper describes Besupp, a website where bereaved individuals can participate in online support groups. Three support groups used Besupp in a ten-week long deployment study. Based on this study, I describe how participants perceived and used the remembrance and social support features of the site. These results form the basis for a set of implications regarding the design of technologies for remembrance, social support, and bereavement more generally.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Microsoft"], "authors": ["Michael Massimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massimi:Michael"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
