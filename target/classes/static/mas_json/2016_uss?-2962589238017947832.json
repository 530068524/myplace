{"title": "Sanctum: Minimal Hardware Extensions for Strong Software Isolation.", "fields": ["private information retrieval", "guard", "multi core processor", "open implementation", "microcode"], "abstract": "Sanctum offers the same promise as Intel\u2019s Software Guard Extensions (SGX), namely strong provable isolation of software modules running concurrently and sharing resources, but protects against an important class of additional software attacks that infer private information from a program\u2019s memory access patterns. Sanctum shuns unnecessary complexity, leading to a simpler security analysis. We follow a principled approach to eliminating entire attack surfaces through isolation, rather than plugging attack-specific privacy leaks. Most of Sanctum\u2019s logic is implemented in trusted software, which does not perform cryptographic operations using keys, and is easier to analyze than SGX\u2019s opaque microcode, which does. Our prototype targets a Rocket RISC-V core, an open implementation that allows any researcher to reason about its security properties. Sanctum\u2019s extensions can be adapted to other processor cores, because we do not change any major CPU building block. Instead, we add hardware at the interfaces between generic building blocks, without impacting cycle time. Sanctum demonstrates that strong software isolation is achievable with a surprisingly small set of minimally invasive hardware changes, and a very reasonable overhead.", "citation": "Citations (119)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Victor Costan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costan:Victor", "Ilia A.
