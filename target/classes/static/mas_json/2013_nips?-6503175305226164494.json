{"title": "On Decomposing the Proximal Map.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "simple function", "mathematics", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "The proximal map is the key step in gradient-type algorithms, which have become prevalent in large-scale high-dimensional problems. For simple functions this proximal map is available in closed-form while for more complicated functions it can become highly nontrivial. Motivated by the need of combining regularizers to simultaneously induce different types of structures, this paper initiates a systematic investigation of when the proximal map of a sum of functions decomposes into the composition of the proximal maps of the individual summands. We not only unify a few known results scattered in the literature but also discover several new decompositions obtained almost effortlessly from our theory.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Yaoliang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yaoliang"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
