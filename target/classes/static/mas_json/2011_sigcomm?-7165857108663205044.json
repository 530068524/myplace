For instance, some networks provide little failure resilience while others provision failover capacity and deploy middleboxes to protect against denial of service attacks [1, 2]. Yet the standard IP interface masks these differences; every network appears to provide the same basic \"dial-tone\" service. Consequently, clients that desire certain network properties must resort to ad hoc techniques to detect these differences or must target the lowest common denominator service.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Alan Shieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shieh:Alan", "Emin G\u00fcn Sirer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sirer:Emin_G=uuml=n", "Fred B.
