{"title": "A fast causal profiler for task parallel programs.", "fields": ["parallel computing", "instruction level parallelism", "task parallelism", "data parallelism", "implicit parallelism"], "abstract": "This paper proposes TASKPROF, a profiler that identifies parallelism bottlenecks in task parallel programs. It leverages the structure of a task parallel execution to perform fine-grained attribution of work to various parts of the program. TASKPROF\u2019s use of hardware performance counters to perform fine-grained measurements minimizes perturbation. TASKPROF\u2019s profile execution runs in parallel using multi-cores. TASKPROF\u2019s causal profile enables users to estimate improvements in parallelism when a region of code is optimized even when concrete optimizations are not yet known. We have used TASKPROF to isolate parallelism bottlenecks in twenty three applications that use the Intel Threading Building Blocks library. We have designed parallelization techniques in five applications to increase parallelism by an order of magnitude using TASKPROF. Our user study indicates that developers are able to isolate performance bottlenecks with ease using TASKPROF.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Adarsh Yoga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoga:Adarsh", "Santosh Nagarakatte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagarakatte:Santosh"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
