{"title": "A general approach for closed-loop registration in AR.", "fields": ["image registration", "projector", "overlay", "virtual image", "augmented reality", "video tracking", "solid modeling"], "abstract": "The typical registration process in augmented reality (AR) consists of three independent consecutive stages: static calibration, dynamic tracking, and graphics overlay. The result is that the real-virtual registration is \u201copen loop\u201d-inaccurate calibration or tracking leads to misregistration that is seen by the users but not the system. To cope with this, we propose a general approach to \u201cclose the loop\u201d in the displayed appearance by using the visual feedback of registration for pose tracking to achieve accurate registration. Specifically, a model-based method is introduced to simultaneously track and augment real objects in a closed-loop fashion, where the model is comprised of the combination of the real object to be tracked and the virtual object to be rendered. This method is applicable to paradigms including video-based AR, projector-based AR, and diminished reality. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of Central Florida", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of Central Florida"], "authors": ["Feng Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Feng", "Ryan Schubert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schubert:Ryan", "Greg Welch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welch:Greg"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
