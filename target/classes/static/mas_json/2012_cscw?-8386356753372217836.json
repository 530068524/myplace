As production of online videos is increasing exponentially, it is becoming more difficult for users to reach relevant content. In this paper, we propose SynTag, a web-based platform that enables users to label three types of tags -- Good, Question, and Disagree -- and to make comments synchronously and asynchronously with visualization of time-stamp video previews on an interactive timeline. SynTag generates real-time thumbnails by using real-time tags for presenters to receive instant feedback and for other users to retrieve presentation videos. In a pilot study, we found our users' tagging behaviors significantly different when they were in lecture events or discussion events. We envision that enabling users to apply tags in real-time will help reduce the complexity of classification of videos.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["National Cheng Kung University", "National Cheng Kung University", "National Cheng Kung University", "National Cheng Kung University"], "authors": ["Yen-Chia Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Yen=Chia", "Taysheng Jeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeng:Taysheng", "Yang-Ting Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yang=Ting", "Po-Chun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Po=Chun"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
