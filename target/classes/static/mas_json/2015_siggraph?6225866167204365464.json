However, those processes can be improved. With the improvement in gesture recognition nowadays, virtual information operations are no longer confined to the mouse and keyboard. We can use the recognized gestures to apply to difficult operations in editing model motion. And for observing 3D model, we would use head tracking from external devices to improve it. It would be easy to observe the interactive results without complicated operation because the system will accurately map the real world head movements.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Liang-Chen Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Liang=Chen", "Jia-Ye Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jia=Ye", "Yu-Hsuan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Yu=Hsuan", "Ming Ouhyoung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouhyoung:Ming"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
