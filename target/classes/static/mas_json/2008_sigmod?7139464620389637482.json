However, current state-ofthe-art event detection systems such as Cayuga [14], SASE [46] or SnoopIB[1], assume the data is  precise . Noise in the data can be captured using techniques such as hidden Markov models. Inference on these models creates streams of probabilistic events which cannot be directly queried by existing systems. To address this challenge we propose Lahar1, an event processing system for probabilistic event streams. By exploiting the probabilistic nature of the data, Lahar yields a much higher recall and precision than deterministic techniques operating over only the most probable tuples. By using a novel static analysis and novel algorithms, Lahar processes data orders of magnitude more efficiently than a naive approach based on sampling. In this paper, we present Lahar's static analysis and core algorithms. We demonstrate the quality and performance of our approach through experiments with our prototype implementation and comparisons with alternate methods.", "citation": "Citations (311)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Christopher R\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=eacute=:Christopher", "Julie Letchner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Letchner:Julie", "Magdalena Balazinska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balazinska:Magdalena", "Dan Suciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suciu:Dan"], "pages": 14}
