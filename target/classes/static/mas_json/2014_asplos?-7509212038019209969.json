{"title": "Speculative hardware/software co-designed floating-point multiply-add fusion.", "fields": ["rounding", "specfp", "floating point", "latency", "legacy system"], "abstract": "A Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) instruction is currently available in many general-purpose processors. It increases performance by reducing latency of dependent operations and increases precision by computing the result as an indivisible operation with no intermediate rounding. However, since the arithmetic behavior of a single-rounding FMA operation is different than independent FP multiply followed by FP add instructions, some algorithms require significant revalidation and rewriting efforts to work as expected when they are compiled to operate with FMA--a cost that developers may not be willing to pay. Because of that, abundant legacy applications are not able to utilize FMA instructions. In this paper we propose a novel HW/SW collaborative technique that is able to efficiently execute workloads with increased utilization of FMA, by adding the option to get the same numerical result as separate FP multiply and FP add pairs. In particular, we extended the host ISA of a HW/SW co-designed processor with a new Combined Multiply-Add (CMA) instruction that performs an FMA operation with an intermediate rounding. This new instruction is used by a transparent dynamic translation software layer that uses a speculative instruction-fusion optimization to transform FP multiply and FP add sequences into CMA instructions. The FMA unit has been slightly modified to support both single-rounding and double-rounding fused instructions without increasing their latency and to provide a conservative fall-back path in case of mispeculation. Evaluation on a cycle-accurate timing simulator showed that CMA improved SPECfp performance by 6.3% and reduced executed instructions by 4.7%.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Marc Lupon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lupon:Marc", "Enric Gibert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gibert:Enric", "Grigorios Magklis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magklis:Grigorios", "Sridhar Samudrala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samudrala:Sridhar", "Ra\u00fal Mart\u00ednez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mart=iacute=nez:Ra=uacute=l", "Kyriakos Stavrou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stavrou:Kyriakos", "David R.
