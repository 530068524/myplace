For these problems, we advocate the use of a generalized version of OLS motivated by ridge regression, and propose two novel three-step algorithms involving least squares fitting and hard thresholding. The algorithms are methodologically simple to understand intuitively, computationally easy to implement efficiently, and theoretically appealing for choosing models consistently. Numerical exercises comparing our methods with penalization-based approaches in simulations and data analyses illustrate the great potential of the proposed algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "University of Warwick"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Xiangyu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiangyu", "David B.
