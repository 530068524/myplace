{"title": "Empowering authors to diagnose comprehension burden in textbooks.", "fields": ["computer science", "knowledge extraction", "comprehension", "data mining"], "abstract": "Good textbooks are organized in a systematically progressive fashion so that students acquire new knowledge and learn new concepts based on known items of information. We provide a diagnostic tool for quantitatively assessing the comprehension burden that a textbook imposes on the reader due to non-sequential presentation of concepts. We present a formal definition of comprehension burden and propose an algorithmic approach for computing it. We apply the tool to a corpus of high school textbooks from India and empirically examine its effectiveness in helping authors identify sections of textbooks that can benefit from reorganizing the material presented.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "New York University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Rakesh Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal_0001:Rakesh", "Sunandan Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty:Sunandan", "Sreenivas Gollapudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollapudi:Sreenivas", "Anitha Kannan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kannan:Anitha", "Krishnaram Kenthapadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kenthapadi:Krishnaram"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
