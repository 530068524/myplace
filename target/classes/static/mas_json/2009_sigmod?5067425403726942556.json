{"title": "Generating example data for dataflow programs.", "fields": ["dataflow", "data set", "web analytics", "operator", "dataflow programming"], "abstract": "While developing data-centric programs, users often run (portions of) their programs over real data, to see how they behave and what the output looks like. Doing so makes it easier to formulate, understand and compose programs correctly, compared with examination of program logic alone. For large input data sets, these experimental runs can be time-consuming and inefficient. Unfortunately, sampling the input data does not always work well, because selective operations such as filter and join can lead to empty results over sampled inputs, and unless certain indexes are present there is no way to generate biased samples efficiently. Consequently new methods are needed for generating example input data for data-centric programs.   We focus on an important category of data-centric programs,  dataflow programs , which are best illustrated by displaying the series of intermediate data tables that occur between each pair of operations. We introduce and study the problem of generating example intermediate data for dataflow programs, in a manner that illustrates the semantics of the operators while keeping the example data small. We identify two major obstacles that impede naive approaches, namely (1) highly selective operators and (2) noninvertible operators, and offer techniques for dealing with these obstacles. Our techniques perform well on real dataflow programs used at Yahoo! for web analytics.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Christopher Olston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olston:Christopher", "Shubham Chopra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chopra:Shubham", "Utkarsh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Utkarsh"], "pages": 12}
