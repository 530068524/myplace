{"title": "ARIEL: automatic wi-fi based room fingerprinting for indoor localization.", "fields": ["mobile phone", "building management", "motion detection", "hotspot", "occupancy"], "abstract": "People spend the majority of their time indoors, and human indoor activities are strongly correlated with the rooms they are in. Room localization, which identifies the room a person or mobile phone is in, provides a powerful tool for characterizing human indoor activities and helping address challenges in public health, productivity, building management, etc. Existing room localization methods, however, require labor-intensive manual annotation of individual rooms.   We present ARIEL, a room localization system that automatically learns room fingerprints based on occupants' indoor movements. ARIEL consists of (1) a zone-based clustering algorithm that accurately identifies in-room occupancy \"hotspot(s)\" using Wi-Fi signatures; (2) a motion-based clustering algorithm to identify inter-zone correlation, thereby distinguishing different rooms; and (3) an energy-efficient motion detection algorithm to minimize the noise of Wi-Fi signatures. ARIEL has been implemented and deployed for real-world testing with 21 users over a 10-month period. Our studies show that it supports room localization with higher than 95% accuracy without requiring labor-intensive manual annotation.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Yifei Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yifei", "Xin Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Xin", "Kun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Kun", "Qin Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Qin", "Robert P.
