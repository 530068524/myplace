After providing a crisp definition of this set, we show by means of a suitable problem transformation that a goal G belongs to G* if there is an action sequence \u03c0 that is an optimal plan for both the goal G and the goal G extended with extra goals representing the observations. Exploiting this result, we show how the set G* can be computed exactly and approximately by minor modifications of existing optimal and suboptimal planning algorithms, and existing polynomial heuristics. Experiments over several domains show that the suboptimal planning algorithms and the polynomial heuristics provide good approximations of the optimal goal set G* while scaling up as well as state-of-the-art planning algorithms and heuristics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Pompeu Fabra University", "Pompeu Fabra University"], "authors": ["Miquel Ram\u00edrez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ram=iacute=rez:Miquel", "Hector Geffner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geffner:Hector"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
