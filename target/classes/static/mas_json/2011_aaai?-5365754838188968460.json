We empirically demonstrate that it performs well compared to radial basis functions and the polynomial basis, the two most popular fixed bases for linear value function approximation, and is competitive with learned proto-value functions.", "citation": "Citations (193)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["George Konidaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konidaris:George", "Sarah Osentoski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osentoski:Sarah", "Philip S.
