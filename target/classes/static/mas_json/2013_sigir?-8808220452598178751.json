The traditional approaches study the problem as a pairwise similarity function problem. In this paper, we consider this problem from a new perspective as a listwise ranking problem and propose a general cross-modal ranking algorithm to optimize the listwise ranking loss with a low rank embedding, which we call Latent Semantic Cross-Modal Ranking (LSCMR). The latent low-rank embedding space is discriminatively learned by structural large margin learning to optimize for certain ranking criteria directly. We evaluate LSCMR on the Wikipedia and NUS-WIDE dataset. Experimental results show that this method obtains significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (40)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Xinyan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Xinyan", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Siliang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Siliang", "Zhongfei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhongfei", "Xiaofei He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaofei", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
