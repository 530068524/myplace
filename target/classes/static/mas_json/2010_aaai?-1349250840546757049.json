{"title": "Conformal Mapping by Computationally Efficient Methods.", "fields": ["conformal map", "laplace operator", "dimensionality reduction", "embedding", "nonlinear dimensionality reduction"], "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction is the process by which a set of data points in a higher dimensional space are mapped to a lower dimension while maintaining certain properties of these points relative to each other. One important property is the preservation of the three angles formed by a triangle consisting of three neighboring points in the high dimensional space. If this property is maintained for those same points in the lower dimensional embedding then the result is a con-formal map. However, many of the commonly used nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) or Laplacian Eigenmaps (LEM), do not produce conformal maps. Post-processing techniques formulated as instances of semi-definite programming (SDP) problems can be applied to the output of either LLE or LEM to produce a conformal map. However, the effectiveness of this approach is limited by the computational complexity of SDP solvers. This paper will propose an alternative postprocessing algorithm that produces a conformal map but does not require a solution to a SDP problem and so is more computationally efficient thus allowing it to be applied to a wider selection of datasets. Using this alternative solution, the paper will also propose a new algorithm for 3D object classification. An interesting feature of the 3D classification algorithm is that it is invariant to the scale and the orientation of the surface.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Stefan Pintilie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pintilie:Stefan", "Ali Ghodsi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghodsi_0001:Ali"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
