The project is leveraging the latest developments in II research to create a platform on which integration tools can be built and further research conducted. In addition to a scalable, extensible platform, OpenII includes industrial-strength components developed by MITRE, Google, UC-Irvine, and UC-Berkeley that interoperate through a common repository in order to solve II problems. Components of the toolkit have been successfully applied to several large-scale US government II challenges.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation", "Google", "Mitre Corporation", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Len Seligman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seligman:Len", "Peter Mork.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mork:Peter", "Alon Y.
