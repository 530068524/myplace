{"title": "Toward an Architecture for Never-Ending Language Learning.", "fields": ["semi supervised learning", "software agent", "web mining", "never ending language learning", "information extraction"], "abstract": "We consider here the problem of building a never-ending language learner; that is, an intelligent computer agent that runs forever and that each day must (1) extract, or read, information from the web to populate a growing structured knowledge base, and (2) learn to perform this task better than on the previous day. In particular, we propose an approach and a set of design principles for such an agent, describe a partial implementation of such a system that has already learned to extract a knowledge base containing over 242,000 beliefs with an estimated precision of 74% after running for 67 days, and discuss lessons learned from this preliminary attempt to build a never-ending learning agent.", "citation": "Citations (1,250)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Federal University of S\u00e3o Carlos"], "authors": ["Andrew Carlson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carlson:Andrew", "Justin Betteridge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Betteridge:Justin", "Bryan Kisiel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kisiel:Bryan", "Burr Settles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Settles:Burr", "Estevam R.
