In this survey, we will: 1) provide an introduction to SRL, 2) describe some of the distinguishing characteristics of SRL systems, including relational feature construction and collective classification, 3) describe three SRL systems in detail, 4) discuss applications of SRL techniques to important data management problems such as entity resolution, selectivity estimation, and information integration, and 5) discuss connections between SRL methods and existing database research such as probabilistic databases.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Lise Getoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Getoor:Lise", "Lilyana Mihalkova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mihalkova:Lilyana"], "pages": 4}
