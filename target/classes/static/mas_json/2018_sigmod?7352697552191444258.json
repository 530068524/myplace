{"title": "DPaxos: Managing Data Closer to Users for Low-Latency and Mobile Applications.", "fields": ["leader election", "geo replication", "edge computing", "low latency", "state machine replication"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Dynamic Paxos (DPaxos), a Paxos-based consensus protocol to manage access to partitioned data across globally-distributed datacenters and edge nodes. DPaxos is intended to implement a State Machine Replication component in data management systems for the edge. DPaxos targets the unique opportunities of utilizing edge computing resources to support emerging applications with stringent mobility and real-time requirements such as Augmented and Virtual Reality and vehicular applications. The main objective of DPaxos is to reduce the latency of serving user requests, recovering from failures, and reacting to mobility. DPaxos achieves these objectives by a few proposed changes to the traditional Paxos protocol. Most notably, DPaxos proposes a dynamic allocation of quorums ( i.e. , groups of nodes) that are needed for Paxos Leader Election. Leader Election quorums in DPaxos are smaller than traditional Paxos and expand only in the presence of conflicts.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Faisal Nawab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nawab:Faisal", "Divyakant Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Divyakant", "Amr El Abbadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbadi:Amr_El"], "pages": 16}
