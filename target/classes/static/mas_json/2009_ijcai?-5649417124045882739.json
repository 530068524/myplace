In this paper, we first show that the least-squares policy iteration (LSPI) framework allows us to employ statistical active learning methods for linear regression. Then we propose a design method of good sampling policies for efficient exploration, which is particularly useful when the sampling cost of immediate rewards is high. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method, named active policy iteration (API), through simulations with a batting robot.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Takayuki Akiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akiyama:Takayuki", "Hirotaka Hachiya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hachiya:Hirotaka", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
