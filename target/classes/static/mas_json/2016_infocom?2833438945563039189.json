The classification of renewable and non-renewable energy brings in several challenges. First, it is necessary to understand how the routing system can distinguish the two types of energy in the power supply. Second, the routing problem changes due to renewable energy; and so do the algorithm designs and analysis. We first clarify the model of how routers can distinguish renewable and non-renewable energy supporting their power supply. This cannot be determined by the routing system alone, and involves modeling the energy generation and supply of the grid. We then present the router power consumption model, which has a fixed startup power and a dynamic traffic-dependent power. We formulate a minimum non-renewable energy routing problem, and two special cases representing either the startup power dominates or the traffic-dependent power dominates. We analyze the complexity of these problems, develop optimal and sub-optimal algorithms, and jointly consider QoS requirements such as path stretch. We evaluate our algorithms using real data from both National and European centers. As compared to the algorithms minimizing the total energy, our algorithms can reduce the non-renewable energy consumption for more than 20% under realistic assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Harbin Engineering University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Yuan", "Dan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Dan", "Dawei Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Dawei", "Mingwei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Mingwei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
