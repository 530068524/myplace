{"title": "Planning with SAT, Admissible Heuristics and A*.", "fields": ["iterative method", "iterative deepening depth first search", "machine learning", "heuristics", "heuristic"], "abstract": "We study the relationship between optimal planning algorithms, in the form of (iterative deepening) A* with (forward) state-space search, and the reduction of the problem to SAT. Our results establish a strict dominance relation between the two approaches: any iterative deepening A* search can be efficiently simulated in the SAT framework, assuming that the heuristic has been encoded in the SAT problem, but the opposite is not possible as A* and IDA* searches sometimes take exponentially longer.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Australian National University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jussi Rintanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rintanen:Jussi"], "pages": 6}
