The ultimate goal in this setting is to discover structures from structurally different partitions of a fixed but unknown target class. An example of such a process is that of computer-aided de novo drug design. In the past 20 years several Monte Carlo search heuristics have been developed for this process. Motivated by these hand-crafted search heuristics, we devise a Metropolis--Hastings sampling scheme where the acceptance probability is given by a probabilistic surrogate of the target property, modeled with a max entropy conditional model. The surrogate model is updated in each iteration upon the evaluation of a selected structure. The proposed approach is consistent and the empirical evidence indicates that it achieves a large structural variety of discovered targets.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Bonn", "Washington University in St. Louis", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Dino Oglic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oglic:Dino", "Roman Garnett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garnett:Roman", "Thomas G\u00e4rtner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=auml=rtner:Thomas"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
