However, the existing work suffer from poor performance in one or more of the metrics of optimality, delay, and convergence speed. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a largely overlooked but highly effective heavy-ball optimization method. Based on this heavy-ball technique, we develop a cross-layer optimization framework that offers utility-optimality, fast-convergence, and significant delay reduction. Our contributions are three-fold: i) we propose a heavy-ball joint congestion control and routing/scheduling framework for both single-hop and multi-hop wireless networks; ii) we show that the proposed heavy-ball method offers an elegant three-way trade-off in utility, delay, and convergence, which is achieved under a near index-type simple policy; and more importantly, iii) our work opens the door to an unexplored network control and optimization paradigm that leverages advanced optimization techniques based on \u201cmemory/momentum\u201d information.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Air Force Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Jia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Jia", "Atilla Eryilmaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eryilmaz:Atilla", "Ness B.
