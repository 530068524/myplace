{"title": "Oblivious Routing for the Lp-norm.", "fields": ["approximation algorithm", "binary logarithm", "euclidean distance", "competitive analysis", "convex combination"], "abstract": "Gupta et al. [GHR06] introduced a very general multi-commodity flow problem in which the cost of a given flow solution on a graph G=(V, E) is calculated by first computing the link loads via a load-function l, that describes the load of a link as a function of the flow traversing the link, and then aggregating the individual link loads into a single number via an aggregation function. In this paper we show the existence of an oblivious routing scheme with competitive ratio O(log n) and a lower bound of Omega(log n/log log n) for this model when the aggregation function agg is an L_p-norm. Our results can also be viewed as a generalization of the work on approximating metrics by a distribution over dominating tree metrics (see e.g. [Bar96, Bar98, FRT03]) and the work on minimum congestion oblivious routing [Rae02, HHR03, Rae08]. We provide a convex combination of trees such that routing according to the tree distribution approximately minimizes the L_p-norm of the link loads. The embedding techniques of Bartal [Bar96, Bar98] and Fakcharoenphol et al. [FRT03] can be viewed as solving this problem in the L_1-norm while the result of Racke [Rae08] solves it for L_\\infty. We give a single proof that shows the existence of a good tree-based oblivious routing for any L_p-norm. For the Euclidean norm, we also show that it is possible to compute a tree-based oblivious routing scheme in polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "University of Warwick"], "authors": ["Matthias Englert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Englert:Matthias", "Harald R\u00e4cke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=cke:Harald"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
