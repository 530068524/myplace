{"title": "Extending autocompletion to tolerate errors.", "fields": ["edit distance", "prefix", "blossom algorithm", "string searching algorithm", "typing"], "abstract": "Autocompletion is a useful feature when a user is doing a look up from a table of records. With every letter being typed, autocompletion displays strings that are present in the table containing as their prefix the search string typed so far. Just as there is a need for making the lookup operation tolerant to typing errors, we argue that autocompletion also needs to be error-tolerant. In this paper, we take a first step towards addressing this problem. We capture input typing errors via edit distance. We show that a naive approach of invoking an offline edit distance matching algorithm at each step performs poorly and present more efficient algorithms. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (156)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Surajit Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Surajit", "Raghav Kaushik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaushik:Raghav"], "pages": 12}
