Fuzzy extensions of EL can express the vagueness inherent in many biomedical concepts. We study the reasoning problem of deciding positive subsumption in fuzzy EL with semantics based on general t-norms. We show that the complexity of this problem depends on the specific t-norm chosen. More precisely, if the t-norm has zero divisors, then the problem is co-NP-hard; otherwise, it can be decided in polynomial time. We also show that the best subsumption degree cannot be computed in polynomial time if the t-norm contains the Lukasiewicz t-norm.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Stefan Borgwardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borgwardt:Stefan", "Rafael Pe\u00f1aloza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pe=ntilde=aloza:Rafael"], "pages": 7}
