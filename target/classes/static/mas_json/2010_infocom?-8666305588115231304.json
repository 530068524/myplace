Key challenges in the design of an incentive scheme for DTN are that disconnections among nodes are the norm rather than exception and network topology is time varying. Thus, it is difficult to detect selfish actions that can be launched by mobile users or to pre-determine the routing path to be used. In this paper, we propose MobiCent, a credit-based incentive system for DTN. While MobiCent allows the underlying routing protocol to discover the most efficient paths, it is also incentive compatible. Therefore, using MobiCent, rational nodes will not purposely waste transfer opportunity or cheat by creating non-existing contacts to increase their rewards. MobiCent also provides different payment mechanisms to cater to client that wants to minimize either payment or data delivery delay.", "citation": "Citations (218)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Bin Bin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bin_Bin", "Mun Choon Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Mun_Choon"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
