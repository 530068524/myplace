Reusing knowledge across tasks is crucial to solving tasks efficiently with lower sample complexity. We provide a Reinforcement Learning agent with the ability to transfer knowledge by learning reusable skills, a type of temporally extended action (also known as Options (Sutton et. al. 1999)). The agent learns reusable skills to solve tasks in Minecraft, a popular video game which is an unsolved and high-dimensional lifelong learning problem. These reusable skills, which we refer to as Deep Skill Networks (DSNs), are then incorporated into our novel Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Network (H-DRLN) architecture. The H-DRLN, a hierarchical extension of Deep Q-Networks, learns to efficiently solve tasks by reusing knowledge from previously learned DSNs. The DSNs are incorporated into the H-DRLN using two techniques: (1) a DSN array and (2) skill distillation, our novel variation of policy distillation (Rusu et. al. 2015) for learning skills. Skill distillation enables the H-DRLN to scale in lifelong learning, by accumulating knowledge and encapsulating multiple reusable skills into a single distilled network. The H-DRLN exhibits superior performance and lower learning sample complexity (by taking advantage of temporally extended actions) compared to the regular Deep Q Network (Mnih et. al. 2015) in sub-domains of Minecraft. We also show the potential to transfer knowledge between related Minecraft tasks without any additional learning.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Chen Tessler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tessler:Chen", "Shahar Givony.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Givony:Shahar", "Tom Zahavy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zahavy:Tom", "Daniel J.
