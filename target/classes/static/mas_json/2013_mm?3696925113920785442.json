Choosing discriminative features for the representation of video segments is a key issue in designing video affective content analysis algorithms, where no dominant feature representation has emerged yet. Most existing affective content analysis methods either use low-level audio-visual features or generate hand-crafted higher level representations. In this work, we propose to use deep learning methods, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in order to learn mid-level representations from automatically extracted raw features. We exploit only the audio modality in the current framework and employ Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features in order to build higher level audio representations. We use the learned representations for the affective classification of music video clips. We choose multi-class support vector machines (SVMs) for classifying video clips into affective categories. Preliminary results on a subset of the DEAP dataset show that a significant improvement is obtained when we learn higher level representations instead of using low-level features directly for video affective content analysis. We plan to further extend this work and include visual modality as well. We will generate mid-level visual representations using CNNs and fuse these visual representations with mid-level audio representations both at feature- and decision-level for video affective content analysis.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin"], "authors": ["Esra Acar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acar:Esra"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
