{"title": "Building Verifiable Trusted Path on Commodity x86 Computers.", "fields": ["trusted client", "trusted service manager", "hengzhi chip", "trusted network connect", "trusted timestamping"], "abstract": "A trusted path is a protected channel that assures the secrecy and authenticity of data transfers between a user's input/output (I/O) device and a program trusted by that user. We argue that, despite its incontestable necessity, current commodity systems do not support trusted path with any significant assurance. This paper presents a hyper visor-based design that enables a trusted path to bypass an untrusted operating-system, applications, and I/O devices, with a minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB). We also suggest concrete I/O architectural changes that will simplify future trusted-path system design. Our system enables users to verify the states and configurations of one or more trusted-paths using a simple, secret less, hand-held device. We implement a simple user-oriented trusted path as a case study.", "citation": "Citations (117)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Zongwei Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zongwei", "Virgil D.
