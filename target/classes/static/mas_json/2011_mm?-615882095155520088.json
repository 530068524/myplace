Comic episode thumbnails are generated based on image analysis technologies developed especially for comic images. Namely, the following procedures are developed for our system: automatic comic frame segmentation, text balloon extraction, and a linear regression based model to calculate the importance score of each extracted frame. The system then selects frames from each episode with high importance score, and aligns the selected frames to create the episode thumbnail, which is presented to the system user as a compact preview of the episode. User experiments conducted with actual Japanese comic images prove that the proposed method significantly decreases the time necessary to search for specific episodes from a large scaled comic data collection.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Waseda University", "Waseda University", "KDDI R&D Labora ...
