Video quality fairness, as well as similar delivery delay is targeted among streams. The proposed control system is implemented within some aggregator located near the bottleneck of the network.   This is done by allocating the transmission rate among streams based on the quality of the already encoded and buffered packets in the aggregator. Encoding rate targets are evaluated by the aggregator and fed back to each remote video server, or directly evaluated by each server in a distributed way. Each encoding rate target is adjusted for each stream independently based on the corresponding buffering delay in the aggregator.   The transmission and encoding rate control problems are addressed with a control-theoretic perspective. The system is described with a multi-input multi-output model and several Proportional Integral (PI) controllers are used to adjust the video quality as well as the buffering delay. The study of the system equilibrium and stability provides guidelines for choosing the parameters of the PI controllers. Experimental results show that better quality fairness is obtained compared to classical transmission rate fair streaming solutions while keeping similar buffering delays.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Institut Universitaire de France"], "authors": ["Nesrine Changuel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Changuel:Nesrine", "Bessem Sayadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sayadi:Bessem", "Michel Kieffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kieffer:Michel"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
