In this paper, we predict the demographics of Twitter users based on whom they follow. Whereas most prior approaches rely on a supervised learning approach, in which individual users are labeled with demographics, we instead create a distantly labeled dataset by collecting audience measurement data for 1,500 websites (e.g., 50% of visitors to gizmodo.com are estimated to have a bachelor's degree). We then fit a regression model to predict these demographics using information about the followers of each website on Twitter. The resulting average held-out correlation is .77 across six different variables (gender, age, ethnicity, education, income, and child status). We additionally validate the model on a smaller set of Twitter users labeled individually for ethnicity and gender, finding performance that is surprisingly competitive with a fully supervised approach.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Aron Culotta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Culotta:Aron", "Nirmal Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Nirmal_Ravi", "Jennifer Cutler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cutler:Jennifer"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
