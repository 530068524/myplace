{"title": "A Joint Sequence Translation Model with Integrated Reordering.", "fields": ["transfer based machine translation", "bleu", "natural language processing", "machine translation", "phrase"], "abstract": "We present a novel machine translation model which models translation by a linear sequence of operations. In contrast to the \"N-gram\" model, this sequence includes not only translation but also reordering operations. Key ideas of our model are (i) a new reordering approach which better restricts the position to which a word or phrase can be moved, and is able to handle short and long distance re-orderings in a unified way, and (ii) a joint sequence model for the translation and reordering probabilities which is more flexible than standard phrase-based MT. We observe statistically significant improvements in BLEU over Moses for German-to-English and Spanish-to-English tasks, and comparable results for a French-to-English task.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Nadir Durrani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durrani:Nadir", "Helmut Schmid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmid:Helmut", "Alexander M.
