{"title": "Efficient rotation invariant object detection using boosted Random Ferns.", "fields": ["invariant", "statistical classification", "object detection", "supervised learning", "boosting"], "abstract": "We present a new approach for building an efficient and robust classifier for the two class problem, that localizes objects that may appear in the image under different orientations. In contrast to other works that address this problem using multiple classifiers, each one specialized for a specific orientation, we propose a simple two-step approach with an estimation stage and a classification stage. The estimator yields an initial set of potential object poses that are then validated by the classifier. This methodology allows reducing the time complexity of the algorithm while classification results remain high. The classifier we use in both stages is based on a boosted combination of Random Ferns over local histograms of oriented gradients (HOGs), which we compute during a preprocessing step. Both the use of supervised learning and working on the gradient space makes our approach robust while being efficient at run-time. We show these properties by thorough testing on standard databases and on a new database made of motorbikes under planar rotations, and with challenging conditions such as cluttered backgrounds, changing illumination conditions and partial occlusions.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michael Villamizar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villamizar:Michael", "Francesc Moreno-Noguer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moreno=Noguer:Francesc", "Juan Andrade-Cetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andrade=Cetto:Juan", "Alberto Sanfeliu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanfeliu:Alberto"], "pages": 8}
