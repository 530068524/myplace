{"title": "NoTamper: automatic blackbox detection of parameter tampering opportunities in web applications.", "fields": ["black box testing", "replicate", "computation", "expiration date", "web application"], "abstract": "Web applications rely heavily on client-side computation to examine and validate form inputs that are supplied by a user (e.g., \"credit card expiration date must be valid\"). This is typically done for two reasons: to reduce burden on the server and to avoid latencies in communicating with the server. However, when a server fails to replicate the validation performed on the client, it is potentially vulnerable to attack. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically detecting potential server-side vulnerabilities of this kind in existing (legacy) web applications through blackbox analysis. We discuss the design and implementation of NoTamper, a tool that realizes this approach. NoTamper has been employed to discover several previously unknown vulnerabilities in a number of open-source web applications and live web sites.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Prithvi Bisht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bisht:Prithvi", "Timothy L.
