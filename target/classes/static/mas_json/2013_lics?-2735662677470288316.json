{"title": "An Optimal Gaifman Normal Form Construction for Structures of Bounded Degree.", "fields": ["exponential growth", "bounded function", "model theory", "exponential formula", "exponential function"], "abstract": "This paper's main result presents a 3-fold exponential algorithm that transforms a first-order formula p together with a number d into a formula in Gaifman normal form that is equivalent to p on the class of structures of degree at most d. For structures of polynomial growth, we even get a 2-fold exponential algorithm. These results are complemented by matching lower bounds: We show that for structures of degree 2, a 2-fold exponential blow-up in the size of formulas cannot be avoided. And for structures of degree 3, a 3-fold exponential blow-up is unavoidable. As a result of independent interest we obtain a 1-fold exponential algorithm which transforms a given first-order sentence p of a very restricted shape into a sentence in Gaifman normal form that is equivalent to p on all structures.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Goethe University Frankfurt", "Information Technology University", "Goethe University Frankfurt"], "authors": ["Lucas Heimberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heimberg:Lucas", "Dietrich Kuske.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuske:Dietrich", "Nicole Schweikardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schweikardt:Nicole"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
