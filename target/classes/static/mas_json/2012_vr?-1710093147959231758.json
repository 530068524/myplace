{"title": "Virtual reality to go: A USC ICT Mixed Reality Lab demonstration.", "fields": ["immersion", "emerging technologies", "virtual reality", "computer mediated reality", "mixed reality"], "abstract": "Our demonstration will exhibit a number of low cost virtual reality systems built using smartphones, inexpensive optics, and game engine software. These systems will demonstrate how VR researchers and developers can leverage current trends in commodity hardware and software to bring virtual reality to a wider audience. This demonstration dovetails with the Workshop on Off-the-Shelf Virtual Reality (OTSVR), which we will also be organizing at the VR conference. The Mixed Reality Lab at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies works to advance the design and practice of mixed reality and virtual reality. The lab is particularly focused on the research and development of new technologies and techniques to enhance immersion and interaction for learning and training.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "USC Institute f ... ve Technologies", "USC Institute f ... ve Technologies"], "authors": ["David M.
