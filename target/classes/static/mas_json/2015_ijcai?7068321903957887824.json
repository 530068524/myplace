Also, when solutions are only partially ordered, there can be a number of different natural notions of optimality, one of the most important being the notion of Possibly Optimal, i.e., optimal in at least one scenario compatible with the inter-objective tradeoffs. We develop an AND/OR Branch-and-Bound algorithm for computing the set of Possibly Optimal solutions, and compare variants of the algorithm experimentally.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University College Cork", "University College Cork", "IBM"], "authors": ["Nic Wilson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilson:Nic", "Abdul Razak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Razak:Abdul", "Radu Marinescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinescu_0002:Radu"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
