The models of the charging speed, horizon, and charging demand determine the computational complexity of the charge scheduling problem. For about 20 variants the problem is either in P or weakly NP-hard and dynamic programs exist to compute optimal solutions. About 10 other variants of the problem are strongly NP-hard, presenting a potentially significant obstacle to their use in practical situations of scale.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Mathijs de Weerdt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weerdt:Mathijs_de", "Michael Albert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albert:Michael", "Vincent Conitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conitzer:Vincent", "Koos van der Linden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linden:Koos_van_der"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
