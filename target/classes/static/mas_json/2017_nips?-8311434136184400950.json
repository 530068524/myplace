It has been known that using binary weights and activations drastically reduce memory size and accesses, and can replace arithmetic operations with more efficient bitwise operations, leading to much faster test-time inference and lower power consumption. However, previous works on binarizing CNNs usually result in severe prediction accuracy degradation. In this paper, we address this issue with two major innovations: (1) approximating full-precision weights with the linear combination of multiple binary weight bases; (2) employing multiple binary activations to alleviate information loss. The implementation of the resulting binary CNN, denoted as ABC-Net, is shown to achieve much closer performance to its full-precision counterpart, and even reach the comparable prediction accuracy on ImageNet and forest trail datasets, given adequate binary weight bases and activations.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["DJI", "DJI", "DJI"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Xiaofan Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xiaofan", "Cong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Cong", "Wei Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Wei"], "pages": 9}
