This problem is NP-complete and, as expected, is a hard task. Moreover, today's technology still does not address this problem in an acceptable way. This paper introduces a new approach to solving the software dependency problem in a Linux environment, devising a way for solving dependencies according to available packages and user preferences. This work introduces the \"apt-pbo\" tool, the first publicly available tool that solves dependencies in a complete and optimal way.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["ISCTE \u2013 University Institute of Lisbon", "INESC-ID", "INESC-ID"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Paulo Trezentos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trezentos:Paulo", "In\u00eas Lynce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lynce:In=ecirc=s", "Arlindo L.
