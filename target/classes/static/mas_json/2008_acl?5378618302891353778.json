We employ a similar approach to propagate consistent event arguments across sentences and documents. Combining global evidence from related documents with local decisions, we design a simple scheme to conduct cross-document inference for improving the ACE event extraction task 1 . Without using any additional labeled data this new approach obtained 7.6% higher F-Measure in trigger labeling and 6% higher F-Measure in argument labeling over a state-of-the-art IE system which extracts events independently for each sentence.", "citation": "Citations (230)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Heng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Heng", "Ralph Grishman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grishman:Ralph"], "pages": 9}
