Supporting such scenarios requires an adequate service matching approach. Many existing approaches do not fulfill two key requirements of emerging concepts like On-The-Fly-Computing, namely (1) comprehensiveness, i.e., the consideration of different service views that cover not only functional properties, but also non-functional properties and (2) fuzzy matching, i.e., the ability to deliver gradual results in order to cope with a certain extent of uncertainty, incompleteness, and tolerance ranges. In this paper, I present a fuzzy matching process that distinguishes between different fuzziness sources and leverages fuzziness in different matching steps which consider several service views, e.g., behavior and quality properties.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Paderborn"], "authors": ["Marie Christin Platenius.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Platenius:Marie_Christin"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
