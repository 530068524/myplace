{"title": "Simultaneous Cake Cutting.", "fields": ["communication complexity", "fair division", "proportionality", "sketch", "mechanism design"], "abstract": "We introduce the simultaneous model for cake cutting (the fair allocation of a divisible good), in which agents simultaneously send messages containing a sketch of their preferences over the cake. We show that this model enables the computation of divisions that satisfy proportionality -- a popular fairness notion -- using a protocol that circumvents a standard lower bound via parallel information elicitation. Cake divisions satisfying another prominent fairness notion, envy-freeness, are impossible to compute in the simultaneous model, but admit arbitrarily good approximations.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Aarhus University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Eric Balkanski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balkanski:Eric", "Simina Br\u00e2nzei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Br=acirc=nzei:Simina", "David Kurokawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurokawa:David", "Ariel D.
