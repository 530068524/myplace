We propose a method to automatically adjust multiple learning rates so as to minimize the expected error at any one time. The method relies on local gradient variations across samples. In our approach, learning rates can increase as well as decrease, making it suitable for non-stationary problems. Using a number of convex and non-convex learning tasks, we show that the resulting algorithm matches the performance of SGD or other adaptive approaches with their best settings obtained through systematic search, and effectively removes the need for learning rate tuning.", "citation": "Citations (222)", "departments": ["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "authors": ["Tom Schaul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaul:Tom", "Sixin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Sixin", "Yann LeCun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/LeCun:Yann"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
