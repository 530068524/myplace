{"title": "Automated security testing of web widget interactions.", "fields": ["web widget", "static web page", "security testing", "web application security", "plug in"], "abstract": "We present a technique for automatically detecting security vulnerabilities in client-side self-contained components, called web widgets, that can co-exist independently on a single web page. In this paper we focus on two security scenarios, namely the case in which (1) a malicious widget changes the content (DOM) of another widget, and (2) a widget steals data from another widget and sends it to the server via an HTTP request. We propose a dynamic analysis approach for automatically executing the web application and analyzing the runtime changes in the user interface, as well as the outgoing HTTP calls, to detect inter-widget interaction violations.   Our approach, implemented in a number of open source A TUSA  plugins, called D IVA , requires no modification of application code, and has few false positives. We discuss the results of an empirical evaluation of the violation revealing capabilities, performance, and scalability of our approach, by means of two case studies, on the Exact Widget Framework and Pageflakes, a commercial, widely used widget framework.", "citation": "Citations (46)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Cor-Paul Bezemer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bezemer:Cor=Paul", "Ali Mesbah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mesbah_0001:Ali", "Arie van Deursen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deursen:Arie_van"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
