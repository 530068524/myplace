{"title": "A Direct Boosting Approach for Semi-supervised Classification.", "fields": ["boosting", "coordinate descent", "labeled data", "gradient boosting", "brownboost"], "abstract": "We introduce a semi-supervised boosting approach (SSDBoost), which directly minimizes the classification errors and maximizes the margins on both labeled and unlabeled samples, without resorting to any upper bounds or approximations. A two-step algorithm based on coordinate descent/ascent is proposed to implement SSDBoost. Experiments on a number of UCI datasets and synthetic data show that SSDBoost gives competitive or superior results over the state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised boosting algorithms in the cases that the labeled data is limited, and it is very robust in noisy cases.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Wright State University", "Wright State University", "Wright State University", "Wright State University"], "authors": ["Shaodan Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Shaodan", "Tian Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Tian", "Zhongliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhongliang", "Shaojun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shaojun"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
