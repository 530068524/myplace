For static processor Storm SP16, a block-based 16 ways parallel CAVLC is presented with streaming processing. A component-oriented CAVLC encoder is proposed aiming at dynamic stream processor GPU. Experiments results show that, compared to the CPU version, more than 70 times of speedup can be obtained for the CAVLC based on Storm and over 50 times for GPU-based component-oriented CAVLC encoder. The throughput of the presented CAVLC encoder is more than 10 times higher over that of published software CAVLC encoders on DSP and multi-core platforms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Huayou Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Huayou", "Chunyuan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chunyuan", "Jun Chai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chai:Jun", "Mei Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Mei", "Nan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0003:Nan", "Ju Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Ju"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
