We propose a generative model -- sampling with reduced replacement (SWIRL) -- for such lists. We discuss SWIRL's relation to standard sampling paradigms, provide the maximum likelihood estimate for learning, and demonstrate its value with two real-world applications: (i) In a \"feature volunteering\" task where non-experts spontaneously generate feature \u21d2 label pairs for text classification, SWIRL improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art feature-learning frameworks. (ii) In a \"verbal uency\" task where brain-damaged patients generate word lists when prompted with a category, SWIRL parameters align well with existing psychological theories, and our model can classify healthy people vs. patients from the lists they generate.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Kwang-Sung Jun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jun:Kwang=Sung", "Xiaojin (Jerry) Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaojin_=Jerry=", "Burr Settles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Settles:Burr", "Timothy T.
