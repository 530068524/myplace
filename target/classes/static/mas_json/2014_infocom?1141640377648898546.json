{"title": "Utility-based cooperative decision in cooperative authentication.", "fields": ["computer network", "nash equilibrium", "complete information", "authentication", "authentication protocol"], "abstract": "In mobile networks, cooperative authentication is an efficient way to rec ognize false identities and mes sage s . However, an attacker can track the location of cooperative mobile nodes by monitoring the ir communications . Moreover , mobile nodes consume their own resource s when cooperating with other nodes in the process of authentication . The se two factors caus e selfish mobile nodes not to actively participate in authentication. In this paper, a bargaining - based game for cooperative authentication is proposed to help nodes decide whether to participate in authentication or not , and our strategy guarantees that m obile no des participating in cooperative authentication can obtain the m aximum utility , all at an acceptable cost . We obtain Nash equilibrium in static complete information games. To a ddress the problem of nodes not know ing the utility of other nodes , inco mplete information games for cooperative authentication are established. We also develop an algorithm based on incomplete information games to maximize every node's utility. The simulation results demonstrate that our strategy has the ability to guarantee authentication probability and increase the number of successful authentications .", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Inst. of Inf.
