The algorithm is a building block for many machine-learning operations. We present a system for privacy-preserving ridge regression. The system outputs the best-fit curve in the clear, but exposes no other information about the input data. Our approach combines both homomorphic encryption and Yao garbled circuits, where each is used in a different part of the algorithm to obtain the best performance. We implement the complete system and experiment with it on real data-sets, and show that it significantly outperforms pure implementations based only on homomorphic encryption or Yao circuits.", "citation": "Citations (156)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Tel Aviv University", "Technicolor", "Technicolor", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Valeria Nikolaenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikolaenko:Valeria", "Udi Weinsberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weinsberg:Udi", "Stratis Ioannidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ioannidis:Stratis", "Marc Joye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joye:Marc", "Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan", "Nina Taft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taft:Nina"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2013", "pages": 15}
