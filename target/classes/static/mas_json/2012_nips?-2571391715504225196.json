Despite its importance, scalable algorithms often eschew rich statistical models in favor of simpler descriptions such as k-means clustering. In this paper we present a sampler, capable of estimating mixtures of exponential families. At its heart lies a novel proposal distribution using random projections to achieve high throughput in generating proposals, which is crucial for clustering models with large numbers of clusters.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Amr Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Amr", "Sujith Ravi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravi:Sujith", "Shravan M.
