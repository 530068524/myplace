DISCO Nets allow us to efficiently sample from a posterior distribution parametrised by a neural network. During training, DISCO Nets are learned by minimising the dissimilarity coefficient between the true distribution and the estimated distribution. This allows us to tailor the training to the loss related to the task at hand. We empirically show that (i) by modeling uncertainty on the output value, DISCO Nets outperform equivalent non-probabilistic predictive networks and (ii) DISCO Nets accurately model the uncertainty of the output, outperforming existing probabilistic models based on deep neural networks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["CentraleSup\u00e9lec", "University College London", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Diane Bouchacourt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouchacourt:Diane", "Pawan Kumar Mudigonda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mudigonda:Pawan_Kumar", "Sebastian Nowozin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nowozin:Sebastian"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
