Surprisingly, the space used by the data structure is $\\widetilde{O}(n /k)$, where the $\\widetilde{O}(\\cdot)$ notation here hides terms that are exponential in $d$, roughly varying as $1/\\varepsilon^d$; as such, the space used is sublinear in the input size if $k$ is sufficiently large. Our approach provides a novel way to summarize geometric data, such that meaningful proximity queries on the data can be carried out using this sketch. Using this, we provide a sublinear space data structure that can estimate the density of a point set under various measures, including (i) sum of distances of $k$ closest points to the query point and (ii) sum of squared distances of $k$ closest points to the query point. Our approach generalizes to other distance-based estimations of densities of similar flavor.
