In the past few years, a number of works discussed the use of friendly jamming to protect the confidentiality of the communicated data as well as to enable message authentication and access control. In this work, we analytically and experimentally evaluate the confidentiality that can be achieved by the use of friendly jamming, given an attacker with multiple receiving antennas. We construct a MIMO-based attack that allows the attacker to recover data protected by friendly jamming and refine the conditions for which this attack is most effective. Our attack shows that friendly jamming cannot provide strong confidentiality guarantees in all settings. We further test our attack in a setting where friendly jamming is used to protect the communication to medical implants.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Nils Ole Tippenhauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tippenhauer:Nils_Ole", "Luka Malisa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malisa:Luka", "Aanjhan Ranganathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranganathan:Aanjhan", "Srdjan Capkun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capkun:Srdjan"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2013", "pages": 14}
