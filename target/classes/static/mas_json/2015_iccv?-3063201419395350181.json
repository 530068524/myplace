{"title": "Unsupervised Semantic Parsing of Video Collections.", "fields": ["semantic computing", "natural language processing", "human communication", "generative model", "parsing"], "abstract": "Human communication typically has an underlying structure. This is reflected in the fact that in many user generated videos, a starting point, ending, and certain objective steps between these two can be identified. In this paper, we propose a method for parsing a video into such semantic steps in an unsupervised way. The proposed method is capable of providing a semantic \"storyline\" of the video composed of its objective steps. We accomplish this utilizing both visual and language cues in a joint generative model. The proposed method can also provide a textual description for each of identified semantic steps and video segments. We evaluate this method on a large number of complex YouTube videos and show results of unprecedented quality for this new and impactful problem.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Max Planck Society", "Stanford University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ozan Sener.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sener:Ozan", "Amir Roshan Zamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zamir:Amir_Roshan", "Silvio Savarese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savarese:Silvio", "Ashutosh Saxena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saxena:Ashutosh"], "pages": 9}
