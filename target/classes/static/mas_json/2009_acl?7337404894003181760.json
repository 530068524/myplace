We base our approach on Latent Dirichlet Allocation and evaluate along two dimensions: (1) the precision of the ranked lists of attributes, and (2) the quality of the attribute assignments to WordNet concepts. In all cases we find that the principled LDA-based approaches outperform previously proposed heuristic methods, greatly improving the specificity of attributes at each concept.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Amphitheatre Pa ... ew, California"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Joseph Reisinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reisinger:Joseph", "Marius Pasca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasca:Marius"], "pages": 9}
