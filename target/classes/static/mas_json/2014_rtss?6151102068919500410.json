While mixed-criticality scheduling has been extensively studied for the uniprocessor case, the problem of efficient scheduling for the multiprocessor case has largely remained open. We design a fluid model-based multiprocessor mixed-criticality scheduling algorithm, called MC-Fluid, in which each task is executed in proportion to its criticality-dependent rate. We propose an exact schedulability condition for MC-Fluid and an optimal assignment algorithm for criticality-dependent execution rates with polynomial complexity. Since MC-Fluid cannot construct a schedule on real hardware platforms due to the fluid assumption, we propose MC-DP-Fair algorithm, which can generate a non-fluid schedule while preserving the same schedulability properties as MC-Fluid. We show that MC-Fluid has a speedup factor of (1 + v 5)/2 ( 1.618), which is best known in multiprocessor MC scheduling, and simulation results show that MC-DP-Fair outperforms all existing algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "University of Pennsylvania", "Nanyang Technological University", "KAIST", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Jaewoo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jaewoo", "Kieu-My Phan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phan:Kieu=My", "Xiaozhe Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Xiaozhe", "Jiyeon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jiyeon", "Arvind Easwaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Easwaran:Arvind", "Insik Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Insik", "Insup Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Insup"], "pages": 12}
