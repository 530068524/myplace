To maintain data integrity, when existing storage nodes fail, lost data are regenerated at replacement nodes. Regenerating multiple data losses in batches can reduce the consumption of bandwidth. However, existing schemes are only able to achieve lower bandwidth consumption by utilizing a large number of participating nodes. In this paper, we propose a cooperative pipelined regeneration process that regenerates multiple data losses cooperatively with much fewer participating nodes. We show that cooperative pipelined regeneration is not only able to maintain optimal data integrity, but also able to further reduce the consumption of bandwidth as well.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Jun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0017:Jun", "Xin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xin", "Baochun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baochun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
