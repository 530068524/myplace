For the realizable case, we prove PAC-type upper and lower bounds based on symmetries and matchings in such trees.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Cardiff University", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "ETH, Switzerland"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Ondrej Kuzelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuzelka:Ondrej", "Yuyi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuyi", "Jan Ramon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramon:Jan"], "pages": 7}
