In particular, every finite planar graph is definable in first-order logic with counting using at most 4 variables. The previously best known upper bounds for the dimension and number of variables were 14 and 15, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "Petersburg Depa ... ematics, Russia"], "authors": ["Sandra Kiefer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiefer:Sandra", "Ilia Ponomarenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponomarenko:Ilia", "Pascal Schweitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schweitzer:Pascal"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
