External disk storage is cheap and plentiful compared to the cost of internal RAM. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art external memory search algorithms either rely on brute-force search techniques, such as breadth-first search, or they rely on all node values falling in a narrow range of integers, and thus perform poorly on real-world domains with real-valued costs. We present a new general-purpose algorithm, PEDAL, that uses external memory and parallelism to perform a best-first heuristic search capable of solving large problems with real costs. We show theoretically that PEDAL is I/O efficient and empirically that it is both better on a standard unit-cost benchmark, surpassing internal IDA* on the 15-puzzle, and gives far superior performance on problems with real costs.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of New Hampshire", "University of New Hampshire", "University of New Hampshire"], "authors": ["Matthew Hatem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hatem:Matthew", "Ethan Burns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burns:Ethan", "Wheeler Ruml.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruml:Wheeler"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
