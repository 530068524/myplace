Unfortunately, while network bandwidth is scarce and expensive in the developing world, current WAN accelerators are designed for enterprise use, and are a poor fit in these environments.\n\nWe present Wanax, a WAN accelerator designed for developing-world deployments. It uses a novel multiresolution chunking (MRC) scheme that provides high compression rates and high disk performance for a variety of content, while using much less memory than existing approaches. Wanax exploits the design of MRC to perform intelligent load shedding to maximize throughput when running on resource-limited shared platforms. Finally, Wanax exploits the mesh network environments being deployed in the developing world, instead of just the star topologies common in enterprise branch offices.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "KAIST", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Sunghwan Ihm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ihm:Sunghwan", "KyoungSoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:KyoungSoo", "Vivek S.
