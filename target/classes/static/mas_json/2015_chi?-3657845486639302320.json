However, when looking beyond enjoyment, it is not clear how to actually evaluate serious experience. We present an evaluation of four games that were submitted to a student game design competition; the competition challenged teams to design a game that inspired curiosity around human error and blame culture within the context of healthcare. The entries were judged by a panel of six experts and subjected to a round of play testing by twelve participants. Methods included gameplay observation, questionnaires, post-play interviews and follow-up email questions. We discuss the utility of these methods, with particular emphasis on how they enabled a consideration of the immediate and longer term impact of serious experience on players.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ioanna Iacovides.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iacovides:Ioanna", "Anna Louise Cox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cox:Anna_Louise"], "pages": 10}
