{"title": "A Test Collection for Spoken Gujarati Queries.", "fields": ["gujarati", "information retrieval", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "The development of a new test collection is described in which the task is to search naturally occurring spoken content using naturally occurring spoken queries. To support research on speech retrieval for low-resource settings, the collection includes terms learned by zero-resource term discovery techniques. Use of a new tool designed for exploration of spoken collections provides some additional insight into characteristics of the collection.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "New York University Abu Dhabi", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "authors": ["Douglas W.
