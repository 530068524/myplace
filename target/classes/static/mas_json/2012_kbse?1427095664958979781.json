{"title": "A qualitative study on user guidance capabilities in product configuration tools.", "fields": ["user interface", "end user", "software system", "cognitive dimensions of notations", "automation"], "abstract": "Software systems are nowadays often configured by sales people, domain experts, or even customers instead of engineers. Configuration tools communicate the systems' variability to these end users and provide guidance for selecting and customizing the available features. However, even if a configuration tool creates technically correct systems, addressing the specific needs of business-oriented users remains challenging. We analyze existing configuration tools to identify key capabilities for guiding end users and discuss these capabilities using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework. We present an implementation of the capabilities in our configuration tool DOPLER CW. We performed a qualitative investigation on the usefulness of the tool's capabilities for user guidance in product configuration by involving nine business-oriented experts of two industry partners from the domain of industrial automation. We present key results and derive general implications for tool developers.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Siemens", "JKU Linz, Austria", "JKU Linz, Austria"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Rick Rabiser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabiser:Rick", "Paul Gr\u00fcnbacher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=uuml=nbacher:Paul", "Martin Lehofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehofer:Martin"], "pages": 10}
