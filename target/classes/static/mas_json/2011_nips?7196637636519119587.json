We consider the problem of learning a multiclass predictor that uses only few features, and in particular, the number of used features should increase sub-linearly with the number of possible classes. This implies that features should be shared by several classes. We describe and analyze the ShareBoost algorithm for learning a multiclass predictor that uses few shared features. We prove that Share-Boost efficiently finds a predictor that uses few shared features (if such a predictor exists) and that it has a small generalization error. We also describe how to use ShareBoost for learning a non-linear predictor that has a fast evaluation time. In a series of experiments with natural data sets we demonstrate the benefits of Share-Boost and evaluate its success relatively to other state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "OrCam Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel", "OrCam Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel"], "authors": ["Shai Shalev-Shwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalev=Shwartz:Shai", "Yonatan Wexler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wexler:Yonatan", "Amnon Shashua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shashua:Amnon"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
