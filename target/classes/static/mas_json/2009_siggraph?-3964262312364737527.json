Recently, research that integrates approaches from neuroscience and social psychology has begun to shed light on these processes, and converging evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests a unique role for the medial frontal cortex. We review the emerging literature that relates social cognition to the medial frontal cortex and, on the basis of anatomical and functional characteristics of this brain region, propose a theoretical model of medial frontal cortical function relevant to different aspects of social cognitive processing.", "citation": "Citations (3,272)", "departments": ["University College London", "University of London", "Dartmouth College", "Harvard University", "Dartmouth College", "Harvard University", "Dartmouth College", "Psychology", "Bur. of Labor Stat., USA", "School of Philo ... nguage Sciences"], "authors": ["Coke Ferreiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreiro:Coke"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
