{"title": "Towards Optimal Solar Tracking: A Dynamic Programming Approach.", "fields": ["tracking system", "solar tracker", "energy management", "photovoltaic system", "smart grid"], "abstract": "The power output of photovoltaic systems (PVS) increases with the use of effective and efficient solar tracking techniques. However, current techniques suffer from several drawbacks in their tracking policy: (i) they usually do not consider the forecasted or prevailing weather conditions; even when they do, they (ii) rely on complex closed-loop controllers and sophisticated instruments; and (iii) typically, they do not take the energy consumption of the trackers into account. In this paper, we propose a policy iteration method (along with specialized variants), which is able to calculate near-optimal trajectories for effective and efficient day-ahead solar tracking, based on weather forecasts coming from online providers. To account for the energy needs of the tracking system, the technique employs a novel and generic consumption model. Our simulations show that the proposed methods can increase the power output of a PVS considerably, when compared to standard solar tracking techniques.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "Technical University of Crete", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Athanasios Aris Panagopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panagopoulos:Athanasios_Aris", "Georgios Chalkiadakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chalkiadakis:Georgios", "Nicholas Robert Jennings.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jennings:Nicholas_Robert"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
