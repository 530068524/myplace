However, there is a limited number of studies empirically investigating the actual motivations behind specific refactoring operations applied by developers. To fill this gap, we monitored Java projects hosted on GitHub to detect recently applied refactorings, and asked the developers to explain the reasons behind their decision to refactor the code. By applying thematic analysis on the collected responses, we compiled a catalogue of 44 distinct motivations for 12 well-known refactoring types. We found that refactoring activity is mainly driven by changes in the requirements and much less by code smells. Extract Method is the most versatile refactoring operation serving 11 different purposes. Finally, we found evidence that the IDE used by the developers affects the adoption of automated refactoring tools.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Concordia University", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"], "authors": ["Danilo Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silva:Danilo", "Nikolaos Tsantalis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsantalis:Nikolaos", "Marco Tulio Valente.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valente:Marco_Tulio"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
