Whereas classical bandit solutions only maximize the expected reward, we consider the problem of minimizing risk using notions such as the value-at-risk, the average value-at-risk, and the mean-variance risk. We present algorithms to minimize the risk over a single and multiple time periods, along with PAC accuracy guarantees given a finite number of reward samples. In the single-period case, we show that finding the arm with least risk requires not many more samples than the arm with highest expected reward. Although minimizing the multiperiod value-at-risk is known to be hard, we present an algorithm with comparable sample complexity under additional assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["IBM", "Texas A&M University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jia Yuan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jia_Yuan", "Evdokia Nikolova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikolova:Evdokia"], "pages": 7}
