We give a new Markov chain algorithm to draw a nearly uniform sample from K. The underlying Markov chain is the first to have a mixing time that is strongly polynomial when started from a \u201ccentral\u201d point. We use this result to design an affine interior point algorithm that does a single random walk to solve linear programs approximately.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Chicago", "Microsoft", "Department of C ... o, Chicago, USA"], "authors": ["Ravi Kannan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kannan:Ravi", "Hariharan Narayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanan:Hariharan"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
