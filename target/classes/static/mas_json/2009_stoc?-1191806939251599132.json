The GNRS conjecture characterizes all graphs that have an O(1)-approximate multi-commodity max-flow/min-cut theorem. In particular, its resolution would imply a constant factor approximation for the general Sparsest Cut problem in every family of graphs which forbids some minor. In the course of our study, we prove a number of results of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["James R.
