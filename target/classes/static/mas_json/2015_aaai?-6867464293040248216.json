This paper improves on the effectiveness of energy-aware room-booking and occupancy scheduling approaches, by allowing the scheduling decisions to rely on an explicit model of the building's occupancy-based HVAC control. The core component of our approach is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model which optimally solves the joint occupancy scheduling and occupancy-based HVAC control problem. To scale up to realistic problem sizes, we embed this MILP model into a large neighbourhood search (LNS). We obtain substantial energy reduction in comparison with occupancy-based HVAC control using arbitrary schedules or using schedules obtained by existing heuristic energy-aware scheduling approaches.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["NICTA", "NICTA", "NICTA", "Los Alamos National Laboratory", "Los Alamos National Laboratory"], "authors": ["BoonPing Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:BoonPing", "Menkes van den Briel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Briel:Menkes_van_den", "Sylvie Thi\u00e9baux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thi=eacute=baux:Sylvie", "Scott Backhaus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Backhaus:Scott", "Russell Bent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bent:Russell"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
