A recent study shows that top-k diversified results are useful since the number of matching subgraphs can be very large. In this work, we study the problem of top-k diversified subgraph querying that asks for a set of up to k subgraphs isomorphic to a given query graph, and that covers the largest number of vertices. We propose a novel level-based algorithm for this problem which supports early termination and has a theoretical approximation guarantee. From experiments, most of our results on real datasets used in previous works are near optimal with a query time within 10ms on a commodity machine.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Zhengwei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhengwei", "Ada Wai-Chee Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Ada_Wai=Chee", "Ruifeng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ruifeng"], "pages": 16}
