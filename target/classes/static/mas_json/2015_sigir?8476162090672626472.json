The NTCIR-11 Math Task develops an evaluation test collection for document sections retrieval of scientific articles based on human generated topics. Those topics involve a combination of formula patterns and keywords. In addition, the optional Wikipedia Task provides a test collection for retrieval of individual mathematical formula from Wikipedia based on search topics that contain exactly one formula pattern. We developed a framework for automatic query generation and immediate evaluation. This paper discusses our dataset preparation, topic generation and evaluation methods, and summarizes the results of the participants, with a special focus on the Wikipedia Task.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "George Washington University", "Technical University of Berlin", "National Institute of Standards and Technology"], "authors": ["Moritz Schubotz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schubotz:Moritz", "Abdou Youssef.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Youssef:Abdou", "Volker Markl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markl:Volker", "Howard S.
