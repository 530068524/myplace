{"title": "Do \"Also-Viewed\" Products Help User Rating Prediction?", "fields": ["embedding", "machine learning", "baseline", "collaborative filtering", "world wide web"], "abstract": "For online product recommendation engines, learning high-quality product embedding that captures various aspects of the product is critical to improving the accuracy of user rating prediction. In recent research, in conjunction with user feedback, the appearance of a product as side information has been shown to be helpful for learning product embedding. However, since a product has a variety of aspects such as functionality and specifications, taking into account only its appearance as side information does not suffice to accurately learn its embedding. In this paper, we propose a matrix co-factorization method that leverages information hidden in the so-called \"also-viewed\" products, i.e., a list of products that has also been viewed by users who have viewed a target product. \"Also-viewed\" products reflect various aspects of a given product that have been overlooked by visually-aware recommendation methods proposed in past research. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of user rating prediction. We also perform classification on the product embedding learned by our method, and compare it with a state-of-the-art baseline to demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating high-quality product embedding that better represents the product.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Chanyoung Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Chanyoung", "Dong Hyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Dong_Hyun", "Jinoh Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Jinoh", "Hwanjo Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Hwanjo"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
