The model is designed by introducing a three-way weight tensor to capture the multiplicative interactions between side information and sequences. The proposed model builds on the Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network (TSBN), a sequential stack of Sigmoid Belief Networks (SBNs). The transition matrices are further factored to reduce the number of parameters and improve generalization. When side information is not available, a general framework for semi-supervised learning based on the proposed model is constituted, allowing robust sequence classification. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art predictive and classification performance on sequential data, and has the capacity to synthesize sequences, with controlled style transitioning and blending.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jiaming Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Jiaming", "Zhe Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Zhe", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "pages": 10}
