However, these studies are generally confined within the customer transaction data. Actually, another kind of \u2018deep shopping data\u2019, e.g. which and why goods receiving much attention are not purchased, offers much more valuable information to boost the product design. Unfortunately, these data are totally ignored in legacy systems. This paper introduces an innovative system, called TagBooth, to detect commodities' motion and further discover customers' behaviors, using COTS RFID devices. We first exploit the motion of tagged commodities by leveraging physical-layer information, like phase and RSS, and then design a comprehensive solution to recognize customers' actions. The system has been tested extensively in the lab environment and used for half a year in real retail store. As a result, TagBooth generally performs well to acquire deep shopping data with high accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Tianci Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tianci", "Lei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0025:Lei", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Huaiyi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Huaiyi", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
