A good assignment will not only improve the answers' quality, but also boost the workers' willingness to participate. Although a lot of works have been made to produce better assignment, most of them neglected one of its most important properties: the bipartition, which exists widely in real world scenarios. Such ignorance greatly limits their application under general settings.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Liu Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Liu", "Lei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0002:Lei"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
