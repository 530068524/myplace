{"title": "Transnationalism, Indigenous Knowledge and Technology: Insights from the Kenyan Diaspora.", "fields": ["kenya", "diaspora", "multimedia", "traditional knowledge", "transnationalism"], "abstract": "Our paper investigates how current digital technologies are sufficient, or insufficient, in supporting Kenyan transnationals in practising indigenous knowledge. We first outline a view of indigenous knowledge, and then apply it to a study of diaspora Kenyans living in Australia. The findings are framed as nine techniques for sustaining displaced practising of indigenous knowledge. These appropriations suggest directions for technology innovation, providing design considerations for technologies that translate, formulate and support indigenous knowledge in transnational contexts.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kagonya Awori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Awori:Kagonya", "Frank Vetere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vetere:Frank", "Wally Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith:Wally"], "pages": 10}
