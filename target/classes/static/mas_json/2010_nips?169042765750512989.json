{"title": "Beyond Actions: Discriminative Models for Contextual Group Activities.", "fields": ["tree structure", "activity recognition", "discriminative model", "latent variable", "inference"], "abstract": "We propose a discriminative model for recognizing group activities. Our model jointly captures the group activity, the individual person actions, and the interactions among them. Two new types of contextual information, group-person interaction and person-person interaction, are explored in a latent variable framework. Different from most of the previous latent structured models which assume a predefined structure for the hidden layer, e.g. a tree structure, we treat the structure of the hidden layer as a latent variable and implicitly infer it during learning and inference. Our experimental results demonstrate that by inferring this contextual information together with adaptive structures, the proposed model can significantly improve activity recognition performance.", "citation": "Citations (156)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Tian Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Tian", "Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Yang", "Weilong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Weilong", "Greg Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Greg"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
