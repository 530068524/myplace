{"title": "Expectation and purpose: understanding users' mental models of mobile app privacy through crowdsourcing.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "human computer interaction", "internet privacy", "information privacy", "privacy software"], "abstract": "Smartphone security research has produced many useful tools to analyze the privacy-related behaviors of mobile apps. However, these automated tools cannot assess people's perceptions of whether a given action is legitimate, or how that action makes them feel with respect to privacy. For example, automated tools might detect that a blackjack game and a map app both use one's location information, but people would likely view the map's use of that data as more legitimate than the game. Our work introduces a new model for privacy, namely  privacy as expectations . We report on the results of using crowdsourcing to capture users' expectations of what sensitive resources mobile apps use. We also report on a new privacy summary interface that prioritizes and highlights places where mobile apps break people's expectations. We conclude with a discussion of implications for employing crowdsourcing as a privacy evaluation technique.", "citation": "Citations (341)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Jialiu Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Jialiu", "Norman M.
