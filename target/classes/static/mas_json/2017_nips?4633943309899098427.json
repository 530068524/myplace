However, due to the unbounded nature of density ratio, the estimation proceudre can be vulnerable to corrupted data points, which often pushes the estimated ratio toward infinity. In this paper, we present a robust estimator which automatically identifies and trims outliers. The proposed estimator has a convex formulation, and the global optimum can be obtained via subgradient descent. We analyze the parameter estimation error of this estimator under high-dimensional settings. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the estimator.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["National Presto Industries", "The Institute o ... cal Mathematics", "The Institute o ... cal Mathematics", "Institute of St ... cal Mathematics"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Song Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Song", "Akiko Takeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takeda:Akiko", "Taiji Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Taiji", "Kenji Fukumizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukumizu:Kenji"], "pages": 11}
