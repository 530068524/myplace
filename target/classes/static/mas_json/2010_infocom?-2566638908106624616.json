We address a particularly difficult type of heavy-tailed traffic where only the first moment can be computed, and present the first non-asymptotic end-to-end delay bounds for such traffic. The derived performance bounds are non-asymptotic in that they do not assume a steady state, large buffer, or many sources regime. Our analysis considers a multi-hop path of fixed-capacity links with heavy-tailed self-similar cross traffic at each node. A key contribution of the analysis is a probabilistic sample-path bound for heavy-tailed arrival and service processes, which is based on a scale-free sampling method. We explore how delays scale as a function of the length of the path, and compare them with lower bounds. A comparison with simulations illustrates pitfalls when simulating self-similar heavy-tailed traffic, providing further evidence for the need of analytical bounds.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Deutsche Telekom"], "authors": ["J\u00f6rg Liebeherr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liebeherr:J=ouml=rg", "Almut Burchard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burchard:Almut", "Florin Ciucu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciucu:Florin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
