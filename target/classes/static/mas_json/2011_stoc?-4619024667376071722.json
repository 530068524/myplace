{"title": "Submodular function maximization via the multilinear relaxation and contention resolution schemes.", "fields": ["submodular set function", "rounding", "matroid", "matroid polytope", "knapsack problem", "multilinear map", "monotone polygon"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of maximizing a non-negative submodular set function f:2 N  -> RR +  over a ground set N subject to a variety of packing type constraints including (multiple) matroid constraints, knapsack constraints, and their intersections. In this paper we develop a general framework that allows us to derive a number of new results, in particular when f may be a  non-monotone  function. Our algorithms are based on (approximately) solving the multilinear extension F of f [5] over a polytope P that represents the constraints, and then effectively rounding the fractional solution. Although this approach has been used quite successfully in some settings [6, 22, 24, 13, 3], it has been limited in some important ways. We overcome these limitations as follows.   First, we give constant factor approximation algorithms to maximize F over an arbitrary down-closed polytope P that has an efficient separation oracle. Previously this was known only for monotone functions [36]. For non-monotone functions, a constant factor was known only when the polytope was either the intersection of a fixed number of knapsack constraints [24] or a matroid polytope [37,30]. Second, we show that  contention resolution schemes  are an effective way to round a fractional solution, even when f is non-monotone. In particular, contention resolution schemes for different polytopes can be combined to handle the intersection of different constraints. Via LP duality we show that a contention resolution scheme for a constraint is related to the  correlation gap  [1] of weighted rank functions of the constraint. This leads to an optimal contention resolution scheme for the matroid polytope.   Our results provide a broadly applicable framework for maximizing linear and submodular functions subject to independence constraints. We give several illustrative examples. Contention resolution schemes may find other applications.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["IBM", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "IBM", "ETH Zurich", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Jan Vondr\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vondr=aacute=k:Jan", "Chandra Chekuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chekuri:Chandra", "Rico Zenklusen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zenklusen:Rico"], "pages": 10}
