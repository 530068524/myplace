{"title": "Near-pri: Private, proximity based location sharing.", "fields": ["homomorphic encryption", "android", "popularity", "k nearest neighbors algorithm", "location based service"], "abstract": "As the ubiquity of smartphones increases we see an increase in the popularity of location based services. Specifically, online social networks provide services such as alerting the user of friend co-location, and finding a user's k nearest neighbors. Location information is sensitive, which makes privacy a strong concern for location based systems like these. We have built one such service that allows two parties to share location information privately and securely. Our system allows every user to maintain and enforce their own policy. When one party, (Alice), queries the location of another party, (Bob), our system uses homomorphic encryption to test if Alice is within Bob's policy. If she is, Bob's location is shared with Alice only. If she is not, no user location information is shared with anyone. Due to the importance and sensitivity of location information, and the easily deployable design of our system, we offer a useful, practical, and important system to users. Our main contribution is a flexible, practical protocol for private proximity testing, a useful and efficient technique for representing location values, and a working implementation of the system we design in this paper. It is implemented as an Android application with the Facebook online social network used for communication between users.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Edmund Novak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novak:Edmund", "Qun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
