{"title": "Semi-Supervised Collective Classification via Hybrid Label Regularization.", "fields": ["graph", "exploit", "web page", "regularization", "hyperlink"], "abstract": "Many classification problems involve data instances that are interlinked with each other, such as webpages connected by hyperlinks. Techniques for collective classification (CC) often increase accuracy for such data graphs, but usually require a fully-labeled training graph. In contrast, we examine how to improve the semi-supervised learning of CC models when given only a sparsely-labeled graph, a common situation. We first describe how to use novel combinations of classifiers to exploit the different characteristics of the relational features vs. the non-relational features. We also extend the ideas of label regularization to such hybrid classifiers, enabling them to leverage the unlabeled data to bias the learning process. We find that these techniques, which are efficient and easy to implement, significantly increase accuracy on three real datasets. In addition, our results explain conflicting findings from prior related studies.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["United States Naval Academy", "United States Naval Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Luke K.
