{"title": "Self-Calibration of Optical Lenses.", "fields": ["aperture", "rendering", "exploit", "lens", "calibration"], "abstract": "Even high-quality lenses suffer from optical aberrations, especially when used at full aperture. Furthermore, there are significant lens-to-lens deviations due to manufacturing tolerances, often rendering current software solutions like DxO, Lightroom, and PTLens insufficient as they don't adapt and only include generic lens blur models. We propose a method that enables the self-calibration of lenses from a natural image, or a set of such images. To this end we develop a machine learning framework that is able to exploit several recorded images and distills the available information into an accurate model of the considered lens.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Michael Hirsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirsch_0001:Michael", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard"], "pages": 9}
