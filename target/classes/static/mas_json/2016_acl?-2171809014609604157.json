{"title": "A short proof that O_2 is an MCFL.", "fields": ["euler s formula", "word order", "syntax", "direct proof", "rule based machine translation"], "abstract": "We present a new proof that $O_2$ is a multiple context-free language. It contrasts with a recent proof by Salvati (2015) in its avoidance of concepts that seem specific to two-dimensional geometry, such as the complex exponential function. Our simple proof creates realistic prospects of widening the results to higher dimensions. This finding is of central importance to the relation between extreme free word order and classes of grammars used to describe the syntax of natural language.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of St Andrews"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mark-Jan Nederhof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nederhof:Mark=Jan"], "pages": -1}
