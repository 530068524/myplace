The duality between regularization and prior leads to interpreting regularization methods in terms of maximum a posteriori estimation and has motivated Bayesian interpretations of kernel methods. In this paper we pursue a Bayesian interpretation of sparsity in the kernel setting by making use of a mixture of a point-mass distribution and prior that we refer to as \"Silverman's g-prior.\" We provide a theoretical analysis of the posterior consistency of a Bayesian model choice procedure based on this prior. We also establish the asymptotic relationship between this procedure and the Bayesian information criterion.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "University of California, Berkeley", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zhihua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhihua", "Michael I.
