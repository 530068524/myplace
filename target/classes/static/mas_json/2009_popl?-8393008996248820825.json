{"title": "Proving that non-blocking algorithms don't block.", "fields": ["formal methods", "liveness", "mathematical proof", "proof theory", "concurrency"], "abstract": "A concurrent data-structure implementation is considered non-blocking if it meets one of three following liveness criteria: wait-freedom, lock-freedom, or obstruction-freedom. Developers of non-blocking algorithms aim to meet these criteria. However, to date their proofs for non-trivial algorithms have been only manual pencil-and-paper semi-formal proofs. This paper proposes the first fully automatic tool that allows developers to ensure that their algorithms are indeed non-blocking. Our tool uses rely-guarantee reasoning while overcoming the technical challenge of sound reasoning in the presence of interdependent liveness properties.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Microsoft", "University of Cambridge", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Alexey Gotsman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gotsman:Alexey", "Byron Cook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cook:Byron", "Matthew J.
