Due to the well known NP hardness of subgraph queries, those queries may sometimes take a long time to complete. Our recent investigation on real- world datasets revealed that the performance of queries on graphs generally varies greatly. In other words, query clients may occasionally encounter \u201cunexpectedly\u201d long execution from a subgraph query processor. This paper aims to demonstrate a tool that alleviates the problem by monitoring subgraph query progress. Specifically, we present a novel subgraph query progress indicator called PIGEON that exploits query-time information to report to users accurate estimated query progress. In the demonstration, users may interact with PIGEON to gain insights on the query evaluation, which include the following: Users are enabled to (i) monitor query progress; (ii) analyze the causes of long query times; and (iii) abort queries that run abnormally long, which may sometimes contain human errors.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Xiaojing Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Xiaojing", "Zhe Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Zhe", "Byron Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Byron", "Peipei Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Peipei", "Sourav S.
