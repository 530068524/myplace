As a corollary, this implies super polynomial lower bounds for the Alon -- Saks -- Seymour conjecture in graph theory. Our approach is to first exhibit a query complexity separation for the decision tree analogue of the UP vs. coNP question -- namely, unambiguous DNF width vs. CNF width -- and then \"lift\" this separation over to communication complexity using a result from prior work.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Mika G\u00f6\u00f6s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml==ouml=s:Mika"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
