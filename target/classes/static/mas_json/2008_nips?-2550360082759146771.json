Mathematical models for Bayesian decision making typically require data-structures that are hard to implement in neural networks. This article shows that even the simplest and experimentally best supported type of synaptic plasticity, Hebbian learning, in combination with a sparse, redundant neural code, can in principle learn to infer optimal Bayesian decisions. We present a concrete Hebbian learning rule operating on log-probability ratios. Modulated by reward-signals, this Hebbian plasticity rule also provides a new perspective for understanding how Bayesian inference could support fast reinforcement learning in the brain. In particular we show that recent experimental results by Yang and Shadlen [1] on reinforcement learning of probabilistic inference in primates can be modeled in this way.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Bernhard Nessler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nessler:Bernhard", "Michael Pfeiffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfeiffer:Michael", "Wolfgang Maass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maass_0001:Wolfgang"], "pages": 8}
