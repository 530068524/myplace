{"title": "Social language network analysis.", "fields": ["social network analysis", "hierarchy", "friendship", "organizational network analysis", "situated"], "abstract": "In this note we introduce a new methodology that combines tools from social language processing and network analysis to identify socially situated relationships between individuals, even when these relationships are latent or unrecognized. We call this approach social language network analysis (SLNA). We describe the philosophical antecedents of SLNA, the mechanics of preprocessing, processing, and post-processing stages, and the results of applying this approach to a 15-month corporate discussion archive. These example results include an explicit mapping of both the perceived expertise hierarchy and the social support / friendship network within this group.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Sandia National Laboratories", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Andrew J.
