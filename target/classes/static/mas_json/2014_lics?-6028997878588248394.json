In this paper we show how to axiomatically extend KAT with this extra feature in the form of  mutable tests . The extension is conservative and is formulated as a general commutative coproduct construction. We give several results on deductive completeness and complexity of the system, as well as some examples of its use.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Departments of  ...
