To enable richer interaction, we explore the design space of multi-touch document folding. We discuss several design considerations for simple modeless gesturing and compatibility with standard Drag and Pinch gestures. We categorize gesture models along the characteristics of Symmetric/Asymmetric and Serial/Parallel, which yields three gesture models. We built a prototype document workspace application that integrates folding and standard gestures, and a system for testing the gesture models. A user study was conducted to compare the three models and to analyze the factors of fold direction, target symmetry, and target tolerance in user performance when folding a document to a specific shape. Our results indicate that all three factors were significant for task times, and parallelism was greater for symmetric targets.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Patrick Chiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiu:Patrick", "Chunyuan Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Chunyuan", "Francine Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Francine"], "pages": 10}
