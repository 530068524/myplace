{"title": "New Generic Algorithms for Hard Knapsacks.", "fields": ["priority queue", "birthday problem", "tilde", "computer science", "knapsack problem", "lattice reduction", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the complexity of solving hard knapsack problems, i.e., knapsacks with a density close to 1 where lattice-based low density attacks are not an option. For such knapsacks, the current state-of-the-art is a 31-year old algorithm by Schroeppel and Shamir which is based on birthday paradox techniques and yields a running time of $\\tilde{O}(2^{n/2})$ for knapsacks of n elements and uses $\\tilde{O}(2^{n/4})$ storage. We propose here two new algorithms which improve on this bound, finally lowering the running time down to either $\\tilde{O} (2^{0.385\\, n})$ or $\\tilde{O} (2^{0.3113\\, n})$ under a reasonable heuristic. We also demonstrate the practicality of these algorithms with an implementation.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University", "Arlington"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Nick Howgrave-Graham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Howgrave=Graham:Nick", "Antoine Joux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joux:Antoine"], "pages": 22}
