First, we propose new features based on neural networks to model various non-local translation phenomena. Second, we augment the architecture of the neural network with tensor layers that capture important higher-order interaction among the network units. Third, we apply multitask learning to estimate the neural network parameters jointly. Each of our proposed methods results in significant improvements that are complementary. The overall improvement is +2.7 and +1.8 BLEU points for Arabic-English and Chinese-English translation over a state-of-the-art system that already includes neural network features.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["BBN Technologies", "BBN Technologies", "BBN Technologies", "BBN Technologies", "BBN Technologies"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hendra Setiawan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Setiawan:Hendra", "Zhongqiang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zhongqiang", "Jacob Devlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Devlin:Jacob", "Thomas Lamar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lamar:Thomas", "Rabih Zbib.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zbib:Rabih", "Richard M.
