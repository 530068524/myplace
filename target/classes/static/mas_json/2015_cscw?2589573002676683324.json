Calendar systems and medication containers, the main types of time-based objects studied, were used as part of two family-based collaborative work practices: 1) prompting health management activities, and 2) safeguarding these activities. Additionally, these artifacts were part of two social interaction patterns that managed emotional intimacy: 1) expressing support, and 2) hiding and disguising illness. Accordingly, home-based illness management may be more collaborative than previously recognized. Moreover, through their interactive incorporation into family life, time-based objects are laden with psychosocial significance. Breakdowns in temporal support were also evident, and were accompanied by: missed medication events; rationing of medications; medication errors; and difficulties with preparation for medical appointments. We propose novel artifact designs to better support patients and their families in managing the temporal aspects of chronic illness together.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Andrea Barbarin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbarin:Andrea", "Tiffany C.
