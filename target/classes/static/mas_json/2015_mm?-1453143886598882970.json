The centralized user interface is broken into pieces woven in the domain environment. Augmented user interface is paired to the physical objects, where physical and digital presentations are displayed in the same context. The augmented interface and physical affordance respond as one control to provide seamless interaction. By connecting digital interface with physical objects, the system presents a nearby embodiment to afford users sense of awareness to interact with domain objects. Integrated on wearable devices as Google Glass, a less intrusive and more convenient interaction is afforded. Our research illustrates the great potential of direct mapping of interaction between digital interfaces and physical affordance by converging wearable devices and augmented reality (AR) technology.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Zhanpeng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zhanpeng", "Weikai Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Weikai", "Pan Hui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hui:Pan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
