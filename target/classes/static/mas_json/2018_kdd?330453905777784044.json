{"title": "FAHES: A Robust Disguised Missing Values Detector.", "fields": ["data set", "anomaly detection", "data analysis", "missing data", "outlier"], "abstract": "Missing values are common in real-world data and may seriously affect data analytics such as simple statistics and hypothesis testing. Generally speaking, there are two types of missing values: explicitly missing values (i.e. NULL values), and implicitly missing values (a.k.a. disguised missing values (DMVs)) such as \"11111111\" for a phone number and \"Some college\" for education. While detecting explicitly missing values is trivial, detecting DMVs is not; the essential challenge is the lack of standardization about how DMVs are generated. In this paper, we present FAHES, a robust system for detecting DMVs from two angles: DMVs as detectable outliers and as detectable inliers. For DMVs as outliers, we propose a syntactic outlier detection module for categorical data, and a density-based outlier detection module for numerical values. For DMVs as inliers, we propose a method that detects DMVs which follow either missing-completely-at-random or missing-at-random models. The robustness of FAHES is achieved through an ensemble technique that is inspired by outlier ensembles. Our extensive experiments using real-world data sets show that FAHES delivers better results than existing solutions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Abdulhakim Ali Qahtan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qahtan:Abdulhakim_Ali", "Ahmed K.
