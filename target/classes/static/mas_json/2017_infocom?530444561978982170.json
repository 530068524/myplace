In this paper, we propose a low latency, low loss streaming mechanism, L4C2, specialized for high-quality delay-sensitive streaming. With L4C2, nodes in the network estimate the acceptable delay and packet loss probability in their uplinks, aiming at retrieving lost data packets from in-network cache and/or coded data packets using in-network coding within an acceptable delay, by extending the Content-Centric Networking (CCN) approach. Further, L4C2 naturally provides multiple paths and multicast technologies to efficiently utilize network resources while sharing network resources fairly with competing data flows by adjusting the video quality when necessary. We validate through comprehensive simulations that L4C2 achieves a high success probability of data transmission considering the acceptable one-way delay, and higher QoE while suppressing the interest and redundant data traffic than the proposed multipath congestion control mechanism in CCN.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Kazuhisa Matsuzono.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsuzono:Kazuhisa", "Hitoshi Asaeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asaeda:Hitoshi", "Thierry Turletti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turletti:Thierry"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
