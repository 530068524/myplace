We propose a novel weakly supervised learning method that models the video event (expression, pain etc.) as a sequence of automatically mined, discriminative sub-events (e.g. onset and offset phase for smile, brow lower and cheek raise for pain). The proposed model is inspired by the recent works on Multiple Instance Learning and latent SVM/HCRF \u2013 it extends such frameworks to model the ordinal or temporal aspect in the videos, approximately. We obtain consistent improvements over relevant competitive baselines on four challenging and publicly available video based facial analysis datasets for prediction of expression, clinical pain and intent in dyadic conversations. In combination with complimentary features, we report state-of-the-art results on these datasets.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Karan Sikka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sikka:Karan", "Gaurav Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Gaurav", "Marian Stewart Bartlett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartlett:Marian_Stewart"], "pages": 10}
