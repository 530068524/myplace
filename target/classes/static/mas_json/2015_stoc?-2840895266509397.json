In this work we construct a 2-server PIR scheme with total communication cost n O\u221a(log log n)/(log n) . This improves over current 2-server protocols which all require \u03a9(n 1/3 ) communication. Our construction circumvents the n 1/3  barrier of Razborov and Yekhanin which holds for the restricted model of bilinear group-based schemes (covering all previous 2-server schemes). The improvement comes from reducing the number of servers in existing protocols, based on Matching Vector Codes, from 3 or 4 servers to 2. This is achieved by viewing these protocols in an algebraic way (using polynomial interpolation) and extending them using partial derivatives.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Zeev Dvir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dvir:Zeev", "Sivakanth Gopi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopi:Sivakanth"], "pages": 8}
