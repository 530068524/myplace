Providing comfort extends beyond managing physical pain to include social, emotional, spiritual, and environmental aspects of care. We studied technology's role in achieving these multifaceted dimensions of comfort through interviews with 16 family members of past hospice patients. Comfort was an ongoing pursuit, requiring the involvement of diverse stakeholders; communication technologies were selectively chosen in service of this achievement. We provide opportunities and recommendations for technologies in hospice, including the need for varying degrees of richness and symmetry, and for support for life-affirming acts. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first study, in the CSCW and HCI literatures, of communication technology use during the final days of a person's life, with implications both for hospice and for the end of life more broadly.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["McGill University", "Microsoft", "McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Robert Douglas Ferguson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferguson:Robert_Douglas", "Michael Massimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massimi:Michael", "Emily Anne Crist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crist:Emily_Anne", "Karyn Anne Moffatt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moffatt:Karyn_Anne"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
