{"title": "Supporting Selective Undo in a Code Editor.", "fields": ["revision control", "graphical user interface", "code", "backtracking", "undo"], "abstract": "Programmers often need to revert some code to an earlier state, or restore a block of code that was deleted a while ago. However, support for this  backtracking  in modern programming environments is limited. Many of the backtracking tasks can be accomplished by having a  selective undo  feature in code editors, but this has major challenges: there can be conflicts among edit operations, and it is difficult to provide usable interfaces for selective undo. In this paper, we present A zurite , an Eclipse plug-in that allows programmers to selectively undo fine-grained code changes made in the code editor. With A zurite , programmers can easily perform backtracking tasks, even when the desired code is not in the undo stack or a version control system. A zurite  also provides novel user interfaces specifically designed for selective undo, which were iteratively improved through user feedback gathered from actual users in a preliminary field trial. A formal lab study showed that programmers can successfully use A zurite , and were twice as fast as when limited to conventional features.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["YoungSeok Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:YoungSeok", "Brad A.
