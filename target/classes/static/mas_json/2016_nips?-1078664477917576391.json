Using our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3%. We also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes.", "citation": "Citations (1,122)", "departments": ["OpenAI", "OpenAI", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "OpenAI"], "authors": ["Tim Salimans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salimans:Tim", "Ian J.
