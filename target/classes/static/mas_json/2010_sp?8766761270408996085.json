{"title": "A Proof-Carrying File System.", "fields": ["enforcement", "computer file", "file system", "authorization", "law enforcement"], "abstract": "We present the design and implementation of PCFS, a file system that adapts proof-carrying authorization to provide direct, rigorous, and efficient enforcement of dynamic access policies. The keystones of PCFS are a new authorization logic BL that supports policies whose consequences may change with both time and system state, and a rigorous enforcement mechanism that combines proof verification with conditional capabilities. We prove that our enforcement using capabilities is correct, and evaluate our design through performance measurements and a case study.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Deepak Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg_0001:Deepak", "Frank Pfenning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfenning:Frank"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2010", "pages": 16}
