Explanations are also provided so that users can obtain a better understanding of the recommendations and decide which recommendations to pursue further. We discuss the technical challenges involved in characterizing different user behaviors and in efficiently computing recommendation explanations.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Columbia University", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sihem Amer-Yahia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amer=Yahia:Sihem", "Alban Galland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galland:Alban", "Julia Stoyanovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoyanovich:Julia", "Cong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Cong"], "pages": 4}
