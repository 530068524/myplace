In this paper, we propose a novel deep-based framework for action recognition, which improves the recognition accuracy by: 1) deriving more precise features for representing actions, and 2) reducing the asynchrony between different information streams. We first introduce a coarse-to-fine network which extracts shared deep features at different action class granularities and progressively integrates them to obtain a more accurate feature representation for input actions. We further introduce an asynchronous fusion network. It fuses information from different streams by asynchronously integrating stream-wise features at different time points, hence better leveraging the complementary information in different streams. Experimental results on action recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Nanjing University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Weiyao Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Weiyao", "Chongyang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chongyang", "Ke Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Ke", "Bin Sheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheng:Bin", "Jianxin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jianxin", "Bingbing Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Bingbing", "Xin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xin", "Hongkai Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Hongkai"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
