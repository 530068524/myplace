In this context, the rank of the factorization is an important parameter that determines runtime as well as generalization ability. To identify conditions under which factorization is an efficient approach for learning from relational data, we derive upper and lower bounds on the rank required to recover adjacency tensors. Based on our findings, we propose a novel additive tensor factorization model to learn from latent and observable patterns on multi-relational data and present a scalable algorithm for computing the factorization. We show experimentally both that the proposed additive model does improve the predictive performance over pure latent variable methods and that it also reduces the required rank \u2014 and therefore runtime and memory complexity \u2014 significantly.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Maximilian Nickel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nickel:Maximilian", "Xueyan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Xueyan", "Volker Tresp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tresp:Volker"], "pages": 9}
