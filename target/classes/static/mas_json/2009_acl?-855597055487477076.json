Traditionally, story generators rely on a large repository of background knowledge containing information about the story plot and its characters. This information is detailed and usually hand crafted. In this paper we propose a data-driven approach for generating short children's stories that does not require extensive manual involvement. We create an end-to-end system that realizes the various components of the generation pipeline stochastically. Our system follows a generate-and-and-rank approach where the space of multiple candidate stories is pruned by considering whether they are plausible, interesting, and coherent.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Neil Duncan McIntyre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McIntyre:Neil_Duncan", "Mirella Lapata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lapata:Mirella"], "pages": 9}
