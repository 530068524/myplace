We consider the evaluation of a query with a given vertex and a keyword, and the problem is to find a set of $k$ nearest vertices that contain the keyword. The known algorithms for handling this problem only give approximate answers. In this paper, we propose algorithms for top- k  nearest keyword search that provide exact solutions and which handle networks of very large sizes. We have also verified the performance of our solutions compared with the best-known approximation algorithms with experiments on real datasets.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Minhao Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Minhao", "Ada Wai-Chee Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Ada_Wai=Chee", "Raymond Chi-Wing Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Raymond_Chi=Wing"], "pages": 12}
