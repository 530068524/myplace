{"title": "Simple but Effective Heterogeneous Main Memory with On-Chip Memory Controller Support.", "fields": ["conventional memory", "interleaved memory", "registered memory", "computer memory", "memory map"], "abstract": "System-in-Package (SiP) and 3D integration are promising technologies to bring more memory onto a microprocessor package to mitigate the \"memory wall\" problem. In this paper, instead of using them to build caches, we study a heterogenous main memory using both on- and off-package memories providing both fast and high-bandwidth on-package accesses and expandable and low-cost commodity off-package memory capacity. We introduce another layer of address translation coupled with an on-chip memory controller that can dynamically migrate data between off-package and off-package memory either in hardware or with operating system assistance depending on the migration granularity. Our experimental results demonstrate that such design can achieve the average effectiveness of 83% of the ideal case where all memory can be placed in high-speed on-package memory for our simulated benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Xiangyu Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Xiangyu", "Yuan Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Yuan", "Naveen Muralimanohar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muralimanohar:Naveen", "Norman P.
