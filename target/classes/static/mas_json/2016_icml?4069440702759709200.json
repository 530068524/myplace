{"title": "BASC: Applying Bayesian Optimization to the Search for Global Minima on Potential Energy Surfaces.", "fields": ["differential evolution", "bayesian optimization", "maxima and minima", "ranging", "covariance"], "abstract": "We present a novel application of Bayesian optimization to the field of surface science: rapidly and accurately searching for the global minimum on potential energy surfaces. Controlling molecule-surface interactions is key for applications ranging from environmental catalysis to gas sensing. We present pragmatic techniques, including exploration/exploitation scheduling and a custom covariance kernel that encodes the properties of our objective function. Our method, the Bayesian Active Site Calculator (BASC), outperforms differential evolution and constrained minima hopping--two state-of-the-art approaches-- in trial examples of carbon monoxide adsorption on a hematite substrate, both with and without a defect.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Shane Carr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carr:Shane", "Roman Garnett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garnett:Roman", "Cynthia Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo:Cynthia"], "pages": 10}
