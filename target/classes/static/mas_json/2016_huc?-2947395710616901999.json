In this field, most activity recognition systems rely on supervised learning methods to extract activity models from labeled datasets. An inherent problem of that approach consists in the acquisition of comprehensive activity datasets, which is expensive and may violate individuals' privacy. The problem is particularly challenging when focusing on complex ADLs, which are characterized by large intra- and inter-personal variability of execution. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to recognize complex ADLs exploiting the semantics of activities, context data, and sensing devices. Through ontological reasoning, we derive semantic correlations among activities and sensor events. By matching observed sensor events with semantic correlations, a statistical reasoner formulates initial hypotheses about the occurred activities. Those hypotheses are refined through probabilistic reasoning, exploiting semantic constraints derived from the ontology. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets show that the accuracy of our unsupervised method is comparable to the one of state of the art supervised approaches.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Cagliari", "University of Mannheim", "University of Milan", "University of Mannheim"], "authors": ["Daniele Riboni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riboni:Daniele", "Timo Sztyler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sztyler:Timo", "Gabriele Civitarese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Civitarese:Gabriele", "Heiner Stuckenschmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stuckenschmidt:Heiner"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
