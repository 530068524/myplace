Such applications include person and action recognition, text-to-video alignment, object co-segmentation and co-localization in videos and images. One drawback of discriminative clustering, however, is its limited scalability. We address this issue and propose an online optimization algorithm based on the Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm. We apply the proposed method to the problem of weakly supervised learning of actions and actors from movies together with corresponding movie scripts. The scaling up of the learning problem to 66 feature-length movies enables us to significantly improve weakly supervised action recognition.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["PSL Research University", "PSL Research University", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Antoine Miech.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miech:Antoine", "Jean-Baptiste Alayrac.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alayrac:Jean=Baptiste", "Piotr Bojanowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bojanowski:Piotr", "Ivan Laptev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laptev:Ivan", "Josef Sivic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sivic:Josef"], "pages": 10}
