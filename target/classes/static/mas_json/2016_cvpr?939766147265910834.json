{"title": "Synthetic Data for Text Localisation in Natural Images.", "fields": ["deep learning", "clutter", "synthetic data", "scalability", "overlay"], "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a new method for text detection in natural images. The method comprises two contributions: First, a fast and scalable engine to generate synthetic images of text in clutter. This engine overlays synthetic text to existing background images in a natural way, accounting for the local 3D scene geometry. Second, we use the synthetic images to train a Fully-Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) which efficiently performs text detection and bounding-box regression at all locations and multiple scales in an image. We discuss the relation of FCRN to the recently-introduced YOLO detector, as well as other end-toend object detection systems based on deep learning. The resulting detection network significantly out performs current methods for text detection in natural images, achieving an F-measure of 84.2% on the standard ICDAR 2013 benchmark. Furthermore, it can process 15 images per second on a GPU.", "citation": "Citations (187)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ankush Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Ankush", "Andrea Vedaldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vedaldi:Andrea", "Andrew Zisserman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zisserman:Andrew"], "pages": 10}
