{"title": "Reuse in the wild: an empirical and ethnographic study of organizational content reuse.", "fields": ["information needs", "hierarchical organization", "social network", "reuse", "social integration"], "abstract": "We present a large-scale study of content reuse networks in a large and highly hierarchical organization. In our study, we combine analysis of a collection of presentations produced by employees with interviews conducted throughout the organization and a survey to study presentation content reuse. Study results show a variety of information needs and behaviors related to content reuse as well as a need for a personalized and socially-integrated networking tool for enabling easy access to previously generated presentation material. In this paper we describe our findings and outline a set of requirements for an effective content reuse facility.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Iowa", "Columbia University", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yelena Mejova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mejova:Yelena", "Klaar De Schepper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schepper:Klaar_De", "Lawrence Bergman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergman:Lawrence", "Jie Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Jie"], "pages": 10}
