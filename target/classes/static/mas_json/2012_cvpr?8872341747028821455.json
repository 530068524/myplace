However, the homography model is invalid for scenes with significant depth variations, and feature point tracking is fragile in videos with textureless objects, severe occlusion or camera rotation. To address these challenging cases, we propose to solve video stabilization with an additional depth sensor such as the Kinect camera. Though the depth image is noisy, incomplete and low resolution, it facilitates both camera motion estimation and frame warping, which make the video stabilization a much well posed problem. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Microsoft", "Zhejiang University", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shuaicheng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shuaicheng", "Yinting Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yinting", "Lu Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Lu", "Jiajun Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Jiajun", "Ping Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Ping", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian"], "pages": 7}
