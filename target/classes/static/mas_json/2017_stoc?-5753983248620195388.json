Noticing that I\u00a9( m ) time is needed for any algorithm to construct a spectral sparsifier and a spectral sparsifier of  G  requires I\u00a9( n ) edges, a natural question is to investigate, for any constant I\u00b5, if a (1+I\u00b5)-spectral sparsifier of  G  with  O ( n ) edges can be constructed in \ufffd ( m ) time, where the \ufffd  notation suppresses polylogarithmic factors. All previous constructions on spectral sparsification require either super-linear number of edges or  m  1+I\u00a9(1)  time.   In this work we answer this question affirmatively by presenting an algorithm that, for any undirected graph  G  and I\u00b5>0, outputs a (1+I\u00b5)-spectral sparsifier of  G  with  O ( n /I\u00b5 2 ) edges in \ufffd ( m /I\u00b5  O (1) ) time. Our algorithm is based on three novel techniques: (1) a new potential function which is much easier to compute yet has similar guarantees as the potential functions used in previous references; (2) an efficient reduction from a two-sided spectral sparsifier to a one-sided spectral sparsifier; (3) constructing a one-sided spectral sparsifier by a semi-definite program.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yin Tat Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yin_Tat", "He Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:He"], "pages": 10}
