Our framework essentially develops a popular greedy method of bucket-merging into a more generic form, for which we can prove space-quality approximation bounds. When specialized to piecewise linear bucket approximations and commonly used error metrics, such as L 2  or L \u221e , our framework leads to provable error bounds where none were known before, offers new results, or yields simpler and unified algorithms. The conceptual simplicity of our scheme translates into highly practical implementations, as borne out in our simulation studies: the algorithms produce near-optimal approximations, require very small memory footprints, and run extremely fast.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Sorabh Gandhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gandhi:Sorabh", "Luca Foschini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foschini:Luca", "Subhash Suri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suri:Subhash"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
