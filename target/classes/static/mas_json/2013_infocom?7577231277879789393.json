Different from traditional tags, a RFID-based wireless rechargeable sensor node needs to charge its onboard energy storage above a threshold in order to power its sensing, computation and communication components. Consequently, such charging delay imposes a unique design challenge for deploying wireless rechargeable sensor networks. In this paper, we tackle this problem by planning the optimal movement strategy of the RFID reader, such that the time to charge all nodes in the network above their energy threshold is minimized. We first propose an optimal solution using the linear programming method. To further reduce the computational complexity, we then introduce a heuristic solution with a provable approximation ratio of (1 + \u03b8)/(1 - e) by discretizing the charging power on a two-dimensional space. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our design outperforms the set-cover-based design by an average of 24.7% while the computational complexity is O((N/e) 2 ).", "citation": "Citations (128)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Zhejiang University", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Lingkun Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Lingkun", "Peng Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng_0001:Peng", "Yu Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu_0001:Yu", "Jiming Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiming", "Tian He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Tian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
