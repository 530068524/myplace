Although our relaxation involves a semidefinite matrix variable, we reformulate the problem to eliminate the need for general semidefinite programming. In particular, we provide two reformulations that admit fast algorithms. The first is a max-min spectral reformulation exploiting quasi-Newton descent. The second is a min-min reformulation consisting of fast alternating steps of closed-form updates. We evaluate the methods against Expectation-Maximization in a real problem of motion segmentation from video data.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "University of Alberta", "Australian National University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Novi Quadrianto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quadrianto:Novi", "Tib\u00e9rio S.
