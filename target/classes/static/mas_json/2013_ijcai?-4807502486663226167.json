{"title": "Supremal Realizability of Behaviors with Uncontrollable Exogenous Events.", "fields": ["mathematics", "controller", "existential quantification", "realizability", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "The behavior composition problem involves the automatic synthesis of a controller able to \"realize\" (i.e., implement) a desired target behavior specification by suitably coordinating a set of already available behaviors. While the problem has been thoroughly studied, one open issue has resisted a principled solution: if the target specification is not fully realizable, is there a way to realize it \"at best\"? In this paper we answer positively, by showing that there exists a unique supremal realizable target behavior satisfying the specification. More importantly we give an effective procedure to compute such a target. Then, we introduce exogenous events, and show that the supremal can again be computed, though this time, into two variants, depending on the ability to observe such events.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["RMIT University", "RMIT University", "Sapienza Univ.  ... a, Roma, Italy", "Sapienza Univ.  ... a, Roma, Italy"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Nitin Yadav.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yadav:Nitin", "Paolo Felli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felli:Paolo", "Giuseppe De Giacomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giacomo:Giuseppe_De", "Sebastian Sardi\u00f1a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sardi=ntilde=a:Sebastian"], "pages": 7}
