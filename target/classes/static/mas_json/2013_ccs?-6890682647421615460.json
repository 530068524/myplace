The belief semantics is proved to subsume a standard Kripke semantics. The belief semantics yields a direct representation of principals' beliefs, without resorting to the technical machinery used in Kripke semantics. A proof system is given for the logic; that system is proved sound with respect to the belief and Kripke semantics. The soundness proofs are mechanized in Coq.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["George Washington University", "George Washington University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Andrew K.
