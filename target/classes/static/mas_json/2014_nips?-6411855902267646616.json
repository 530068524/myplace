{"title": "Generalized Higher-Order Orthogonal Iteration for Tensor Decomposition and Completion.", "fields": ["equivalence relation", "convergence", "tensor", "scalability", "matrix"], "abstract": "Low-rank tensor estimation has been frequently applied in many real-world problems. Despite successful applications, existing Schatten 1-norm minimization (SNM) methods may become very slow or even not applicable for large-scale problems. To address this difficulty, we therefore propose an efficient and scalable core tensor Schatten 1-norm minimization method for simultaneous tensor decomposition and completion, with a much lower computational complexity. We first induce the equivalence relation of Schatten 1-norm of a low-rank tensor and its core tensor. Then the Schatten 1-norm of the core tensor is used to replace that of the whole tensor, which leads to a much smaller-scale matrix SNM problem. Finally, an efficient algorithm with a rank-increasing scheme is developed to solve the proposed problem with a convergence guarantee. Extensive experimental results show that our method is usually more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods, and is orders of magnitude faster.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Huawei", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yuanyuan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yuanyuan", "Fanhua Shang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shang:Fanhua", "Wei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan_0001:Wei", "James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James", "Hong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Hong"], "pages": 9}
