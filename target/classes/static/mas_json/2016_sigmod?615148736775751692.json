{"title": "Scalable Approximate Query Tracking over Highly Distributed Data Streams.", "fields": ["scalability", "cardinality", "data stream mining", "streaming data", "sampling"], "abstract": "The recently-proposed Geometric Monitoring (GM) method has provided a general tool for the distributed monitoring of arbitrary non-linear queries over streaming data observed by a collection of remote sites, with numerous practical applications. Unfortunately, GM-based techniques can suffer from serious scalability issues with increasing numbers of remote sites. In this paper, we propose novel techniques that effectively tackle the aforementioned scalability problems by exploiting a carefully designed sample of the remote sites for efficient approximate query tracking. Our novel sampling-based scheme utilizes a sample of cardinality proportional to \u221aN (compared to N for the original GM), where $N$ is the number of sites in the network, to perform the monitoring process. Our experimental evaluation over a variety of real-life data streams demonstrates that our sampling-based techniques can significantly reduce the communication cost during distributed monitoring with controllable, predefined accuracy guarantees.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technical University of Crete", "Technical University of Crete", "Technical University of Crete"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Nikos Giatrakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giatrakos:Nikos", "Antonios Deligiannakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deligiannakis:Antonios", "Minos N.
