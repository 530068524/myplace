The key component in query forwarding is the thresholding algorithm by which the forwarding decisions are given. In this paper, we propose a linear-programming-based thresholding algorithm that significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of achieved search efficiency values. Moreover, we evaluate a greedy heuristic for partial index replication and investigate the impact of result cache freshness on query forwarding performance. Finally, we present some optimizations that improve the performance further, under certain conditions. We evaluate the proposed techniques by simulations over a real-life setting, using a large query log and a document collection obtained from Yahoo!.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Bilkent University", "Bilkent University", "Bilkent University", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Berkant Barla Cambazoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cambazoglu:Berkant_Barla", "Emre Varol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varol:Emre", "Enver Kayaaslan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kayaaslan:Enver", "Cevdet Aykanat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aykanat:Cevdet", "Ricardo A.
