{"title": "I3DC: Interactive Three-Dimensional Cubes.", "fields": ["rendering", "online analytical processing", "cube", "distributive property", "data visualization"], "abstract": "We present the I3DC system prototype, which constructs the cube for tens of millions of data items within milliseconds, and provides high-quality cube visualization as well as highly-interactive OLAP operations. Our approach is based on a novel blending-as-aggregation (BAA) algorithm that maps distributive OLAP aggregations to the intrinsic rendering mechanisms of the GPU. Our system runs entirely on the GPU and requires no precomputations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Ke Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ke", "Yinan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yinan", "Qiong Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo_0001:Qiong", "Pedro V.
