{"title": "Privacy preserving cloud data access with multi-authorities.", "fields": ["encryption", "cloud computing security", "cloud storage", "information privacy", "privacy software"], "abstract": "Cloud computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm which enables flexible, on-demand and low-cost usage of computing resources. Those advantages, ironically, are the causes of security and privacy problems, which emerge because the data owned by different users are stored in some cloud servers instead of under their own control. To deal with security problems, various schemes based on the Attribute-Based Encryption have been proposed recently. However, the privacy problem of cloud computing is yet to be solved. This paper presents an anonymous privilege control scheme AnonyControl to address not only the data privacy problem in a cloud storage, but also the user identity privacy issues in existing access control schemes. By using multiple authorities in cloud computing system, our proposed scheme achieves anonymous cloud data access and fine-grained privilege control. Our security proof and performance analysis shows that AnonyControl is both secure and efficient for cloud computing environment.", "citation": "Citations (139)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Center for Sci. ...
