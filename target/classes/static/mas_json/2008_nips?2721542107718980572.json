One of the most widely-used metrics yields the percentage of the variance in the data that is explained by the model. Unfortunately, this metric is biased due to the intrinsic variability in the data. We derive a simple analytical modification of the traditional formula that significantly improves its accuracy (as measured by bias) with similar or better precision (as measured by mean-square error) in estimating the true underlying Variance Explained by the model class. Our estimator advances on previous work by a) accounting for overfitting due to free model parameters mitigating the need for a separate validation data set, b) adjusting for the uncertainty in the noise estimate and c) adding a conditioning term. We apply our new estimator to binocular disparity tuning curves of a set of macaque V1 neurons and find that on a population level almost all of the variance unexplained by Gabor functions is attributable to noise.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["National Institutes of Health", "National Institutes of Health"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ralf M.
