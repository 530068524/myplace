{"title": "Categorised ethical guidelines for large scale mobile HCI.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "management science", "software", "knowledge management", "app store"], "abstract": "The recent rise in large scale trials of mobile software using 'app stores' has moved current researcher practice beyond available ethical guidelines. By surveying this recent and growing body of literature, as well as established professional principles adopted in psychology, we propose a set of ethical guidelines for large scale HCI user trials. These guidelines come in two parts: a set of general principles and a framework into which individual app store-based trials can be assessed and ethical concerns exposed. We categorise existing literature using our scheme, and explain how researchers could use our framework to classify their future user trials to determine ethical responsibility, and the steps required to meet these obligations.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Stockholm University", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "authors": ["Donald McMillan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McMillan:Donald", "Alistair Morrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morrison:Alistair", "Matthew Chalmers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chalmers:Matthew"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
