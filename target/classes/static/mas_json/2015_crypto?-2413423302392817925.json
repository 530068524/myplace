{"title": "An Algebraic Framework for Pseudorandom Functions and Applications to Related-Key Security.", "fields": ["pseudorandom number generator", "algebraic number", "linear independence", "multilinear map", "tuple"], "abstract": "In this work, we provide a new algebraic framework for pseudorandom functions which encompasses many of the existing algebraic constructions, including the ones by Naor and Reingold (FOCS\u201997), by Lewko and Waters (CCS\u201909), and by Boneh, Montgomery, and Raghunathan (CCS\u201910), as well as the related-key-secure pseudorandom functions by Bellare and Cash (Crypto\u201910) and by Abdalla et al. (Crypto\u201914). To achieve this goal, we introduce two versions of our framework. The first, termed linearly independent polynomial security, states that the values (g^{P_1(a)}, ..., g^{P_q(a)}) are indistinguishable from a random tuple of the same size, when P_1, ..., P_q are linearly independent multivariate polynomials of the secret key vector a. The second, which is a natural generalization of the first framework, additionally deals with constructions based on the decision linear and matrix Diffie-Hellman assumptions. In addition to unifying and simplifying proofs for existing schemes, our framework also yields new results, such as related-key security with respect to arbitrary permutations of polynomials. Our constructions are in the standard model and do not require the existence of multilinear maps.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Michel Abdalla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdalla:Michel", "Fabrice Benhamouda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benhamouda:Fabrice", "Alain Passel\u00e8gue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Passel=egrave=gue:Alain"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 22}
