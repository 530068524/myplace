Traditional summarization research has focused on extracting informative sentences from standard documents. With the rapid growth of online social networks, abundant user generated content (e.g., comments) associated with the standard documents is available. Which parts in a document are social users really caring about? How can we generate summaries for standard documents by considering both the informativeness of sentences and interests of social users? This paper explores such an approach by modeling Web documents and social contexts into a unified framework. We propose a dual wing factor graph (DWFG) model, which utilizes the mutual reinforcement between Web documents and their associated social contexts to generate summaries. An efficient algorithm is designed to learn the proposed factor graph model.Experimental results on a Twitter data set validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. By leveraging the social context information, our approach obtains significant improvement (averagely +5.0%-17.3%) over several alternative methods (CRF, SVM, LR, PR, and DocLead) on the performance of summarization.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "IBM", "Tsinghua University", "IBM", "IBM", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Telef\u00f3nica", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Texas A&M University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "Hung Yen University of Technology and Education", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "University College Dublin", "University College Dublin", "University College Dublin", "Wuhan University", "Wuhan University", "Wuhan University", "Wuhan University", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Zi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zi", "Keke Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Keke", "Jie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Jie", "Li Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Li", "Zhong Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Zhong", "Juanzi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Juanzi"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
