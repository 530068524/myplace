{"title": "Catalyzing social support for breast cancer patients.", "fields": ["social support", "breast cancer", "participatory design", "cancer", "social network"], "abstract": "Social support is a critical, yet underutilized resource when undergoing cancer care. Underutilization occurs in two conditions: (a) when patients fail to seek out information, material assistance, and emotional support from family and friends or (b) when family and friends fail to meet the individualized needs and preferences of patients. Social networks are most effective when kept up to date on the patient's status, yet updating everyone takes effort that patients cannot always put in. To improve this situation, we describe the results of our participatory design activities with breast cancer patients. During this process, we uncovered the information a social network needs to stay informed as well as a host of barriers to social support that technology could help break down. Our resulting prototype, built using Facebook Connect, includes explicit features to reduce these barriers and thus, promote the healthy outcomes associated with strong social support.", "citation": "Citations (130)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Meredith M.
