{"title": "Weaving Context Sensitivity into Test Suite Construction.", "fields": ["test case", "test suite", "pairing", "test data", "notation"], "abstract": "Context-aware applications capture environmental changes as contexts and self-adapt their behaviors dynamically. Existing testing research has not explored context evolutions or their patterns inherent to individual test cases when constructing test suites. We propose the notation of context diversity as a metric to measure how many changes in contextual values of individual test cases. In this paper, we discuss how this notion can be incorporated in a test case generation process by pairing it with coverage-based test data selection criteria", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Huai Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huai", "W.
