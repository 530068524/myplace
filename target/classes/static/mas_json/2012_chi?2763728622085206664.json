Incorporating about 10 years of server data from the online peer-production community Everything2, we looked at how specific features of voting predicted deletion of posts. We found that not all types of voting are the same: negative voting of users was the strongest factor explaining deletion of a Write-up. Receiving a positive vote from a member with higher status decreases the chances of deletion, while receiving a positive vote from a user with neutral status has a very little effect on the deletion of content.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "University of Michigan", "Michigan State University"], "authors": ["Chandan Sarkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkar:Chandan", "Donghee Yvette Wohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wohn:Donghee_Yvette", "Cliff Lampe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampe:Cliff", "Kurt DeMaagd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeMaagd:Kurt"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
