Typically, networks fully guarantee service after a single-link failure, which is often an over-provisioning of resources to maintain essential traffic for the infrequent event of a failure. Our scheme guarantees that a fraction q of each demand remains after any single-link failure, at a fraction of the price of full protection. A linear program is developed to find the minimum-cost capacity allocation to meet both demand and protection requirements. For q\u226412, an exact algorithmic solution for the minimum-cost routing and capacity allocation is developed using multiple shortest paths. For q>12, an algorithm is developed based on disjoint path routing that performs, on average, within 1.4% of optimal, and runs four orders of magnitude faster than the minimum-cost solution achieved via the linear program. Moreover, the partial protection strategies developed achieve reductions of up to 83% over traditional full protection schemes.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Greg Kuperman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuperman:Greg", "Eytan Modiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Modiano:Eytan", "Aradhana Narula-Tam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narula=Tam:Aradhana"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
