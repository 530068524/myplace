We designed an online and openly accessible video annotation system that allows anyone with a browser and internet access to efficiently annotate object category, shape, motion, and activity information in real-world videos. The annotations are also complemented with knowledge from static image databases to infer occlusion and depth information. Using this system, we have built a scalable video database composed of diverse video samples and paired with human-guided annotations. We complement this paper demonstrating potential uses of this database by studying motion statistics as well as cause-effect motion relationships between objects.", "citation": "Citations (172)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jenny Yuen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuen:Jenny", "Bryan C.
