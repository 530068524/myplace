A systematic comparison of context-counting vs. context-predicting semantic vectors.", "fields": ["surprise", "distributional semantics", "lexical semantics", "victory", "marketing buzz"], "abstract": "Context-predicting models (more commonly known as embeddings or neural language models) are the new kids on the distributional semantics block. Despite the buzz surrounding these models, the literature is still lacking a systematic comparison of the predictive models with classic, count-vector-based distributional semantic approaches. In this paper, we perform such an extensive evaluation, on a wide range of lexical semantics tasks and across many parameter settings. The results, to our own surprise, show that the buzz is fully justified, as the context-predicting models obtain a thorough and resounding victory against their count-based counterparts.", "citation": "Citations (808)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento", "University of Trento"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Marco Baroni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baroni:Marco", "Georgiana Dinu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinu:Georgiana", "Germ\u00e1n Kruszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kruszewski:Germ=aacute=n"], "pages": 10}
