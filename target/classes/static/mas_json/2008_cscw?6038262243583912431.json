We focus on the capabilities such a robot could have to help focus the attention of a visitor on an object or artefact. Inspired by studies of social interaction, which investigate whether the robot could deploy \"restarts\" and \"pauses\" at certain moments in its talk to first elicit the visitor's attention/gaze towards the robot. We report an experiment where we deployed such a robot to interact with real visitors to a science museum. These experiments show that such a strategy does seem to have a significant impact on obtaining the visitor's gaze.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "Bielefeld University", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "Saitama University"], "authors": ["Hideaki Kuzuoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuzuoka:Hideaki", "Karola Pitsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitsch:Karola", "Yuya Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Yuya", "Ikkaku Kawaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawaguchi:Ikkaku", "Keiichi Yamazaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamazaki:Keiichi", "Akiko Yamazaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamazaki:Akiko", "Yoshinori Kuno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuno:Yoshinori", "Paul Luff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luff:Paul", "Christian Heath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heath:Christian"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
