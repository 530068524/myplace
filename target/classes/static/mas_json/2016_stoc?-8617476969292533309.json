Our main result is a randomized algorithm for computing such an approximation (i.e. achieving l 2 /l 2  sparse recovery guarantees using Fourier measurements) using  O   d  ( k log N loglog N ) samples of the signal in time domain and  O   d  ( k log  d +3   N ) runtime, where  d \u2265 1 is the dimensionality of the Fourier transform. The sample complexity matches the \u03a9( k log( N / k )) lower bound for non-adaptive algorithms due to [DIPW] for any  k \u2264  N  1\u2212\u03b4  for a constant \u03b4>0 up to an  O (loglog N ) factor. Prior to our work a result with comparable sample complexity  k log N  log  O (1) log N  and sublinear runtime was known for the Fourier transform on the line [IKP], but for any dimension  d \u2265 2 previously known techniques either suffered from a (log N ) factor loss in sample complexity or required \u03a9( N ) runtime.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Michael Kapralov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapralov:Michael"], "pages": 14}
