{"title": "Fast and Compact Exact Distance Oracle for Planar Graphs.", "fields": ["vertex", "spacetime", "binary logarithm", "planar graph", "planar"], "abstract": "For a given a graph, a distance oracle is a data structure that answers distance queries between pairs of vertices. We introduce an O(n 5/3)-space distance oracle which answers exact distance queries in O(log n) time for n-vertex planar edge-weighted digraphs. All previous distance oracles for planar graphs with truly subquadratic space (i.e., space O(n 2- ) for some constant 0) either required query time polynomial in n or could only answer approximate distance queries.Furthermore, we show how to trade-off time and space: for any S \u2265 n 3/2, we show how to obtain an S-space distance 5/2 oracle that answers queries in time O(S n 3/2 log n). This is a polynomial improvement over the previous planar distance oracles with o(n 1/4) query time.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Vincent Cohen-Addad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen=Addad:Vincent", "S\u00f8ren Dahlgaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dahlgaard:S=oslash=ren", "Christian Wulff-Nilsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulff=Nilsen:Christian"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
