Our method proposed in this paper tackles this issue by optimally searching least blurred pixels in MFSR. An EM framework is proposed to guide residual blur estimation and high-resolution image reconstruction. To suppress noise, we employ a family of sparse penalties as natural image priors, along with an effective solver. Theoretical analysis is performed on how and when our method works. The relationship between estimation errors of motion blur and the quality of input images is discussed. Our method produces sharp and higher-resolution results given input of challenging low-resolution noisy and blurred sequences.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ziyang Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Ziyang", "Renjie Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Renjie", "Xin Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Xin", "Li Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Li", "Jiaya Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jiaya", "Enhua Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Enhua"], "pages": 9}
