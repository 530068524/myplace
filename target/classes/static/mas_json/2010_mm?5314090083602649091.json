Since player trajectories are necessary to generate the video, we propose a real-time player trajectory estimation method by utilizing the shadow regions from soccer scenes. This paper describes our trial to realize real-time processing. We divide the process into capture and server computers. In addition, we reduced the processing cost with pipeline parallelization and optimization. We apply our proposed method to an actual soccer match held in a stadium and show its effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba"], "authors": ["Nozomu Kasuya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasuya:Nozomu", "Itaru Kitahara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kitahara:Itaru", "Yoshinari Kameda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kameda:Yoshinari", "Yuichi Ohta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohta:Yuichi"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
