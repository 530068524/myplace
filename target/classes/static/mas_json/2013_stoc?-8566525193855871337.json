We suppose that in a large enough document collection the answer to a given question may appear in several different forms. Therefore, it is possible to find one or more sentences that contain the answer and that also include tokens from the original question. The Passage Retrieval engine is almost language-independent since it is based on n-gram structures. Question classification and answer extraction modules are based on shallow patterns.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Valencia", "Polytechnic University of Valencia", "University of Alicante", "Polytechnic University of Valencia", "Harvard University", "Ritsumeikan University", "University of Tokyo", "Mie University", "Polytechnic University of Valencia", "Polytechnic University of Valencia", "Polytechnic University of Valencia", "Polytechnic University of Valencia", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "I3S, Univ.
