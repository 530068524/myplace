Existing methods for sentence-level sentiment classification are mainly based on supervised learning. However, it is difficult to obtain sentiment labels of sentences since manual annotation is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an approach for sentence-level sentiment classification without the need of sentence labels. More specifically, we propose a unified framework to incorporate two types of weak supervision, i.e., document-level and word-level sentiment labels, to learn the sentence-level sentiment classifier. In addition, the contextual information of sentences and words extracted from unlabeled sentences is incorporated into our approach to enhance the learning of sentiment classifier. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment classification.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Fangzhao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Fangzhao", "Jia Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jia", "Zhigang Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Zhigang", "Sixing Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Sixing", "Yongfeng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Yongfeng", "Jun Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Jun"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
