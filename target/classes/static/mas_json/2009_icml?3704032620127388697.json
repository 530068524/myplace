However, users may differ in the features over which they are most comfortable expressing their preferences. In this work we consider the problem of  feature elicitation:  a user's utility function is expressed using features whose definitions (in terms of \"catalog\" features) are unknown. We cast this as a problem of  concept learning , but whose goal is to identify only enough about the concept to enable a good decision to be recommended. We describe computational procedures for identifying optimal alternatives w.r.t.  minimax regret  in the presence of concept uncertainty; and describe several heuristic query strategies that focus on reduction of  relevant  concept uncertainty.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Craig Boutilier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boutilier:Craig", "Kevin Regan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regan:Kevin", "Paolo Viappiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viappiani:Paolo"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
