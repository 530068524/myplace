{"title": "Learning A Structured Optimal Bipartite Graph for Co-Clustering.", "fields": ["foster graph", "simplex graph", "quartic graph", "edge transitive graph", "butterfly graph"], "abstract": "Co-clustering methods have been widely applied to document clustering and gene expression analysis. These methods make use of the duality between features and samples such that the co-occurring structure of sample and feature clusters can be extracted. In graph based co-clustering methods, a bipartite graph is constructed to depict the relation between features and samples. Most existing co-clustering methods conduct clustering on the graph achieved from the original data matrix, which doesn\u2019t have explicit cluster structure, thus they require a post-processing step to obtain the clustering results. In this paper, we propose a novel co-clustering method to learn a bipartite graph with exactly k connected components, where k is the number of clusters. The new bipartite graph learned in our model approximates the original graph but maintains an explicit cluster structure, from which we can immediately get the clustering results without post-processing. Extensive empirical results are presented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our model.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Xiaoqian Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaoqian", "Cheng Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Cheng", "Heng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Heng"], "pages": 10}
