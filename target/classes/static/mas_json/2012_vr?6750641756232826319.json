In this poster, we show how we leveraged these trends to create virtual reality (VR) training games which run entirely on a commodity mobile computing platform. This platform consists of a commercial off-the-shelf game engine, commodity smartphones, and mass produced optics. The games utilize the strengths of this platform to provide immersive features like 360 degree photo panoramas and interactive 3D virtual scenes. By sharing information about building such applications, we hope to enable others to develop new types of mobile VR applications. In particular, we feel this system is ideally suited for casual \u201cpick up and use\u201d VR applications for collaborative classroom learning, design reviews, and other multi-user immersive experiences.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "USC Institute f ... ve Technologies", "USC Institute f ... ve Technologies"], "authors": ["Perry Hoberman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoberman:Perry", "David M.
