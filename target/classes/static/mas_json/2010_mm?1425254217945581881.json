We extend a proven solution for classifying web spam to handle images. We exploit the link structure of the web graph: a web page related to a given category is normally linked to other pages describing related objects. Our approach combines information from the webgraph structure with semi-supervised learning from all the unlabeled images to create a superior image-classification model for multimedia data. We show that fusing image, text and web-graph features gives a 12% improvement (in the area under the ROC curve) over content features alone in an adult image-classification experiment.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Dhruv Kumar Mahajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahajan:Dhruv_Kumar", "Malcolm Slaney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slaney:Malcolm"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
