{"title": "A Deep Semi-NMF Model for Learning Hidden Representations.", "fields": ["matrix decomposition", "non negative matrix factorization", "cluster analysis", "fuzzy clustering", "brown clustering"], "abstract": "Semi-NMF is a matrix factorization technique that learns a low-dimensional representation of a dataset that lends itself to a clustering interpretation. It is possible that the mapping between this new representation and our original features contains rather complex hierarchical information with implicit lower-level hidden attributes, that classical one level clustering methodologies can not interpret. In this work we propose a novel model, Deep Semi-NMF, that is able to learn such hidden representations that allow themselves to an interpretation of clustering according to different, unknown attributes of a given dataset. We show that by doing so, our model is able to learn low-dimensional representations that are better suited for clustering, outperforming Semi-NMF, but also other NMF variants.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["George Trigeorgis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trigeorgis:George", "Konstantinos Bousmalis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bousmalis:Konstantinos", "Stefanos Zafeiriou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zafeiriou:Stefanos", "Bj\u00f6rn W.
