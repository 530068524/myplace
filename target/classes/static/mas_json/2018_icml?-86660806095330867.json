Rather, the sequential dependence of the collection policy can lead to severe distributional biases that persist even in the infinite data limit. We develop a general method decorrelation procedure -- W-decorrelation -- for transforming the bias of adaptive linear regression estimators into variance. The method uses only coarse-grained information about the data collection policy and does not need access to propensity scores or exact knowledge of the policy. We bound the finite-sample bias and variance of the W-estimator and develop asymptotically correct confidence intervals based on a novel martingale central limit theorem. We then demonstrate the empirical benefits of the generic W-decorrelation procedure in two different adaptive data settings: the multi-armed bandits and autoregressive time series models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yash Deshpande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deshpande:Yash", "Lester W.
