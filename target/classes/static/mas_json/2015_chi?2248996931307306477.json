{"title": "Working with Machines: The Impact of Algorithmic and Data-Driven Management on Human Workers.", "fields": ["intelligent decision support system", "management science", "engineering", "data driven", "dynamic pricing", "computer supported cooperative work", "sensemaking"], "abstract": "Software algorithms are changing how people work in an ever-growing number of fields, managing distributed human workers at a large scale. In these work settings, human jobs are assigned, optimized, and evaluated through algorithms and tracked data. We explore the impact of this algorithmic, data-driven management on human workers and work practices in the context of Uber and Lyft, new ridesharing services. Our findings from a qualitative study describe how drivers responded when algorithms assigned work, provided informational support, and evaluated their performance, and how drivers used online forums to socially make sense of the algorithm features. Implications and future work are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Min Kyung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Min_Kyung", "Daniel Kusbit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kusbit:Daniel", "Evan Metsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Metsky:Evan", "Laura Dabbish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dabbish:Laura"], "pages": 10}
