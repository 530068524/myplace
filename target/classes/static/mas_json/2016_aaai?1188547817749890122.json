We propose an efficient stochastic block coordinate descent method using adaptive primal-dual updates, which enables flexible parallel optimization for large-scale problems. Our method shares the efficiency and flexibility of block coordinate descent methods with the simplicity of primal-dual methods and utilizing the structure of the separable convex-concave saddle point problem. It is capable of solving a wide range of machine learning applications, including robust principal component analysis, Lasso, and feature selection by group Lasso, etc. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods in all these applications.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Zhanxing Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Zhanxing", "Amos J.
