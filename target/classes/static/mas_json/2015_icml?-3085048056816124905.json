{"title": "Celeste: Variational inference for a generative model of astronomical images.", "fields": ["optical telescope", "poisson distribution", "inference", "ancillary data", "generative model"], "abstract": "We present a new, fully generative model of optical telescope image sets, along with a variational procedure for inference. Each pixel intensity is treated as a Poisson random variable, with a rate parameter dependent on latent properties of stars and galaxies. Key latent properties are themselves random, with scientific prior distributions constructed from large ancillary data sets. We check our approach on synthetic images. We also run it on images from a major sky survey, where it exceeds the performance of the current state-of-the-art method for locating celestial bodies and measuring their colors.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Harvard University", "University of California, Berkeley", "Harvard University", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jeffrey Regier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regier:Jeffrey", "Andrew C.
