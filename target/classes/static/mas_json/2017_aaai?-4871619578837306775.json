Much effort has been taken to both manually and automatically construct web-scale knowledge bases. Comparing with manually constructed KBs, automatically constructed KB is broader but with more noises. In this paper, we study the problem of improving the quality for automatically constructed web-scale knowledge bases, in particular, lexical taxonomies of isA relationships. We find that these taxonomies usually contain cycles, which are often introduced by incorrect isA relations. Inspired by this observation, we introduce two kinds of models to detect incorrect isA relations from cycles. The first one eliminates cycles by extracting directed acyclic graphs, and the other one eliminates cycles by grouping nodes into different levels. We implement our models on Probase, a state-of-the-art, automatically constructed, web-scale taxonomy. After processing tens of millions of relations, our models eliminate 74 thousand wrong relations with 91% accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Yonsei University", "Facebook"], "authors": ["Jiaqing Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Jiaqing", "Yanghua Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Yanghua", "Yi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yi", "Seung-won Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Seung=won", "Haixun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haixun"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
