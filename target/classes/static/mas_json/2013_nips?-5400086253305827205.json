The algorithm is derived via a low-variance asymptotic analysis of the Gibbs sampling algorithm for the DDPMM, and provides a hard clustering with convergence guarantees similar to those of the k-means algorithm. Empirical results from a synthetic test with moving Gaussian clusters and a test with real ADS-B aircraft trajectory data demonstrate that the algorithm requires orders of magnitude less computational time than contemporary probabilistic and hard clustering algorithms, while providing higher accuracy on the examined datasets.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Duke University", "Ohio State University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Trevor Campbell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Campbell:Trevor", "Miao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Miao", "Brian Kulis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulis:Brian", "Jonathan P.
