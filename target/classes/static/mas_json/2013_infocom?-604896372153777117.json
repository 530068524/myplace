The primary network can be regarded as an existing communication system operated in a licensed band and, therefore, is assumed to operate in an order-optimal fashion to achieve its standalone capacity scaling law. The secondary cognitive network must keep its interference to the primary network below a certain threshold while at the same time maximizing its own throughput scaling law based on cognition information. The existing scaling results for cognitive networks inherently assume multihop communication, which is a restricted coding model. By contrast, in this paper, a general coding model is considered without any specific physical layer coding assumptions. The capacity scaling exponents for both networks are analyzed when the numbers of primary nodes $n$ , primary base stations $l$ , which support the communication between primary nodes, and secondary nodes $m$ increase with the relations $m= n^{beta ^{^{^{}}}}$ , $beta >1$ , and $l=n^{gamma }$ , $0leq gamma leq 1$ . For the extended network model, the capacity scaling exponents are completely characterized as $max {2-alpha /2,1/2,gamma }$ and $max {2-alpha /2,1/2}$ for the primary and- secondary networks respectively, where $alpha >2$ denotes the path-loss exponent. That is, the capacity scaling laws for the primary and secondary networks are represented, respectively, by $n^{max {2-alpha /2,1/2,gamma }pm epsilon }$ and $m^{max {2-alpha /2,1/2}pm epsilon }$ for $epsilon >0$ arbitrarily small. For the dense network model, when the primary network achieves its standalone capacity scaling exponent of 1, the secondary network is shown to achieve a scaling exponent of $1-{1}/({2beta })$ , which improves the previous scaling exponent of 1/2 achieved by multihop. For both models, it turns out that the conventional multihop approach is in general quite suboptimal.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Andong National University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Sang-Woon Jeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeon:Sang=Woon", "Michael Gastpar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gastpar:Michael"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
