Nevertheless, selecting required compositions of loop transformations to achieve this remains a significantly challenging task; current compilers may be off by orders of magnitude in performance compared to hand-optimized programs. To address this fundamental challenge, we first present a convex characterization of all distinct, semantics-preserving, multidimensional affine transformations. We then bring together algebraic, algorithmic, and performance analysis results to design a tractable optimization algorithm over this highly expressive space. Our framework has been implemented and validated experimentally on a representative set of benchmarks running on state-of-the-art multi-core platforms.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "IBM", "University of Paris-Sud", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Louisiana State University"], "authors": ["Louis-No\u00ebl Pouchet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pouchet:Louis=No=euml=l", "Uday Bondhugula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bondhugula:Uday", "C\u00e9dric Bastoul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bastoul:C=eacute=dric", "Albert Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen_0001:Albert", "J.
