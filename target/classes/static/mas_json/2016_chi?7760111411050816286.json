{"title": "Airways: Optimization-Based Planning of Quadrotor Trajectories according to High-Level User Goals.", "fields": ["simulation", "computer vision", "robotics", "videography", "design tool"], "abstract": "In this paper we propose a computational design tool that allows end-users to create advanced quadrotor trajectories with a variety of application scenarios in mind. Our algorithm allows novice users to create quadrotor based use-cases without requiring deep knowledge in either quadrotor control or the underlying constraints of the target domain. To achieve this goal we propose an optimization-based method that generates feasible trajectories which can be flown in the real world. Furthermore, the method incorporates high-level human objectives into the planning of flight trajectories. An easy to use 3D design tool allows for quick specification and editing of trajectories as well as for intuitive exploration of the resulting solution space. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in several real-world application scenarios, including aerial-videography, robotic light-painting and drone racing.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christoph Gebhardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gebhardt:Christoph", "Benjamin Hepp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hepp:Benjamin", "Tobias N\u00e4geli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/N=auml=geli:Tobias", "Stefan Stevsic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stevsic:Stefan", "Otmar Hilliges.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hilliges:Otmar"], "pages": 12}
