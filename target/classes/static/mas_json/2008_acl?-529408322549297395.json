{"title": "Selecting Query Term Alternations for Web Search by Exploiting Query Contexts.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "web query classification", "stemming", "sargable", "web search query"], "abstract": "Query expansion by word alterations (alternative forms of a word) is often used in Web search to replace word stemming. This allows users to specify particular word forms in a query. However, if many alterations are added, query traffic will be greatly increased. In this paper, we propose methods to select only a few useful word alterations for query expansion. The selection is made according to the appropriateness of the alteration to the query context (using a bigram language model), or according to its expected impact on the retrieval effectiveness (using a regression model). Our experiments on two TREC collections will show that both methods only select a few expansion terms, but the retrieval effectiveness can be improved significantly.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Microsoft", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Guihong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Guihong", "Stephen Robertson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robertson:Stephen", "Jian-Yun Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Jian=Yun"], "pages": 8}
