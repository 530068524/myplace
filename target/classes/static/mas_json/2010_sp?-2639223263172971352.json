While this transformation has driven major advancements in efficiency and safety, it has also introduced a range of new potential risks. In this paper we experimentally evaluate these issues on a modern automobile and demonstrate the fragility of the underlying system structure. We demonstrate that an attacker who is able to infiltrate virtually any Electronic Control Unit (ECU) can leverage this ability to completely circumvent a broad array of safety-critical systems. Over a range of experiments, both in the lab and in road tests, we demonstrate the ability to adversarially control a wide range of automotive functions and completely ignore driver input\\dash including disabling the brakes, selectively braking individual wheels on demand, stopping the engine, and so on. We find that it is possible to bypass rudimentary network security protections within the car, such as maliciously bridging between our car's two internal subnets. We also present composite attacks that leverage individual weaknesses, including an attack that embeds malicious code in a car's telematics unit and that will completely erase any evidence of its presence after a crash. Looking forward, we discuss the complex challenges in addressing these vulnerabilities while considering the existing automotive ecosystem.", "citation": "Citations (1,047)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Karl Koscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koscher:Karl", "Alexei Czeskis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czeskis:Alexei", "Franziska Roesner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roesner:Franziska", "Shwetak Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Shwetak", "Tadayoshi Kohno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohno:Tadayoshi", "Stephen Checkoway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Checkoway:Stephen", "Damon McCoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCoy:Damon", "Brian Kantor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kantor:Brian", "Danny Anderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anderson:Danny", "Hovav Shacham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shacham:Hovav", "Stefan Savage.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savage:Stefan"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2010", "pages": 16}
