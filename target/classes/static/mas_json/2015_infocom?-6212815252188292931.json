We conduct a large-scale measurement study of packet loss in four UMTS networks. The study is based on active measurements from hundreds of measurement nodes over a period of one year. We find that a significant fraction of loss occurs during pathological and normal Radio Resource Control (RRC) state transitions. The remaining loss exhibits pronounced diurnal patterns and shows a relatively strong correlation between geographically diverse measurement nodes. Our results indicate that the causes of a significant part of the remaining loss lie beyond the radio access network.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Simula Research Laboratory", "Simula Research Laboratory", "Simula Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Dziugas Baltrunas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baltrunas:Dziugas", "Ahmed Elmokashfi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elmokashfi:Ahmed", "Amund Kvalbein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kvalbein:Amund"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
