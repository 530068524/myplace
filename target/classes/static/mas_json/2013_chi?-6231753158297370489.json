{"title": "From codes to patterns: designing interactive decoration for tableware.", "fields": ["graphic design", "emerging technologies", "exploit", "multimedia", "chart"], "abstract": "We explore the idea of making aesthetic decorative patterns that contain multiple visual codes. We chart an iterative collaboration with ceramic designers and a restaurant to refine a recognition technology to work reliably on ceramics, produce a pattern book of designs, and prototype sets of tableware and a mobile app to enhance a dining experience. We document how the designers learned to work with and creatively exploit the technology, enriching their patterns with embellishments and backgrounds and developing strategies for embedding codes into complex designs. We discuss the potential and challenges of interacting with such patterns. We argue for a transition from designing 'codes to patterns' that reflects the skills of designers alongside the development of new technologies.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "Central Saint Martins", "University of Nottingham", "Central Saint Martins"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rupert Meese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meese:Rupert", "Shakir Ali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ali:Shakir", "Emily-Clare Thorne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thorne:Emily=Clare", "Steve Benford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benford:Steve", "Anthony Quinn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quinn:Anthony", "Richard Mortier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mortier:Richard", "Boriana Koleva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koleva:Boriana", "Tony P.
