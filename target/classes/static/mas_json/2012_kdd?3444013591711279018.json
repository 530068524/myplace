We address such a  Web image prediction  problem at both a collective group level and an individual user level. We develop a predictive framework based on the multivariate point process, which employs a stochastic parametric model to solve the relations between image occurrence and the covariates that influence it, in a flexible, scalable, and globally optimal way. Using Flickr datasets of more than ten million images of 40 topics, our empirical results show that the proposed algorithm is more successful in predicting unseen Web images than other candidate methods, including forecasting on semantic meanings only, a PageRank-based image retrieval, and a generative author-time topic model.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Stanford University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Gunhee Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Gunhee", "Fei-Fei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Fei=Fei", "Eric P.
