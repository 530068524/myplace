This paper presents an online ABFT scheme for FFT so that soft errors can be detected online and the corrupted computation can be terminated in a much more timely manner. We also extend our scheme to tolerate both arithmetic errors and memory errors, develop strategies to reduce its fault tolerance overhead and improve its numerical stability and fault coverage, and finally incorporate it into the widely used FFTW library - one of the today's fastest FFT software implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the proposed online ABFT scheme introduces much lower overhead than the existing offline ABFT schemes; (2) it detects errors in a much more timely manner; and (3) it also has higher numerical stability and better fault coverage.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Xin Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Xin", "Jieyang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jieyang", "Dingwen Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Dingwen", "Sihuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Sihuan", "Panruo Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Panruo", "Hongbo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongbo", "Kaiming Ouyang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouyang:Kaiming", "Yuanlai Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yuanlai", "Fengguang Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Fengguang", "Zizhong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zizhong"], "pages": 12}
