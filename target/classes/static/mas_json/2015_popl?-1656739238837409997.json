We use the framework as follows:   we present a new elementary algebraic theory of quantum computation, built from unitary gates and measurement;   we provide a completeness theorem or the elementary algebraic theory by relating it with a model from operator algebra;    we extract an equational theory for a quantum programming language from the algebraic theory;   we compare quantum computation with other local notions of computation by investigating variations on the algebraic theory.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Radboud University Nijmegen"], "authors": ["Sam Staton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Staton:Sam"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
