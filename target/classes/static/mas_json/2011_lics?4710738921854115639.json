The first algorithm is for testing if a bipartite graph has a perfect matching, and is based on the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma for polynomial identity testing applied to the Edmonds polynomial of the graph. The second algorithm, due to Mulmuley, Vazirani and Vazirani, is for finding a perfect matching, where the key ingredient of this algorithm is the Isolating Lemma.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Dai Tri Man Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Dai_Tri_Man", "Stephen A.
