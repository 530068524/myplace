Implementing updates by hand is challenging for SDN programmers because networks are distributed systems with hundreds or thousands of interacting nodes. Even if initial and final configurations are correct, naively updating individual nodes can lead to incorrect transient behaviors, including loops, black holes, and access control violations. This paper presents an approach for automatically synthesizing updates that are guaranteed to preserve specified properties. We formalize network updates as a distributed programming problem and develop a synthesis algorithm based on counterexample-guided search and incremental model checking. We describe a prototype implementation, and present results from experiments on real-world topologies and properties demonstrating that our tool scales to updates involving over one-thousand nodes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "Cornell University", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Jedidiah McClurg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McClurg:Jedidiah", "Hossein Hojjat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hojjat:Hossein", "Pavol Cern\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cern=yacute=:Pavol", "Nate Foster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foster:Nate"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
