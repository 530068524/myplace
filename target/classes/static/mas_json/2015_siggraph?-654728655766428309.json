We employ individual light sources available in the room such as windows and house lights as basis lighting conditions. We further optimize the projection of a desired lighting environment into the sparse room lighting basis in order to closely approximate the target lighting environment with the given lighting basis. We achieve plausible relit results that compare favourably with ground truth relighting with dense sampling of the reflectance field.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Antoine Toisoul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toisoul:Antoine", "Abhijeet Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Abhijeet"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
