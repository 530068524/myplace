{"title": "Groupwise Registration of Aerial Images.", "fields": ["aerial image", "computer vision", "pairwise comparison", "pattern recognition", "graph"], "abstract": "This paper addresses the task of time separated aerial image registration. The ability to solve this problem accurately and reliably is important for a variety of subsequent image understanding applications. The principal challenge lies in the extent and nature of transient appearance variation that a land area can undergo, such as that caused by the change in illumination conditions, seasonal variations, or the occlusion by non-persistent objects (people, cars). Our work introduces several novelties: (i) unlike all previous work on aerial image registration, we approach the problem using a set-based paradigm; (ii) we show how local, pairwise constraints can be used to enforce a globally good registration using a constraints graph structure; (iii) we show how a simple holistic representation derived from raw aerial images can be used as a basic building block of the constraints graph in a manner which achieves both high registration accuracy and speed. We demonstrate: (i) that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art for pair-wise registration already, achieving greater accuracy and reliability, while at the same time reducing the computational cost of the task; and (ii) that the increase in the number of available images in a set consistently reduces the average registration error.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Deakin University", "Curtin University", "Deakin University"], "authors": ["Ognjen Arandjelovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arandjelovic:Ognjen", "Duc-Son Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Duc=Son", "Svetha Venkatesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkatesh:Svetha"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
