{"title": "Generating implications for design through design research.", "fields": ["strategic design", "interaction design", "design knowledge", "design research", "experience design"], "abstract": "A central tenet of HCI is that technology should be user-centric, with designs being based around social science findings about users. Nevertheless a repeated but critical challenge in design is translating empirical findings into actionable ideas that inform design, or generating  implications for design . Despite various design methods aiming to bridge this gap, knowledge informing design is still seen as problematic. However there has been little empirical exploration into what design researchers  understand  by such design knowledge, the  functions  and  principles  behind their creation. We report on interviews with twelve expert HCI design researchers probing the roles and types of design implications, and the process of generating and evaluating them. We synthesize different types of design implications into a framework to guide their generation. Our findings identify a broader range than previously described, additional sources and heuristics supporting their development as well some important evaluation criteria. We discuss the value of these findings for interaction design research.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Corina Sas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sas:Corina", "Steve Whittaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittaker:Steve", "Steven Dow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dow:Steven", "Jodi Forlizzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forlizzi:Jodi", "John Zimmerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmerman:John"], "pages": 10}
