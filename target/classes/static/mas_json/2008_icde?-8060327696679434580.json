{"title": "A Scalable Scheme for Bulk Loading Large RDF Graphs into Oracle.", "fields": ["oracle", "semantic web", "rdf schema", "scalability", "rdf"], "abstract": "The growth of RDF data makes it imperative that an efficient mechanism for bulk-loading RDF graphs be supported. Thus, the paper proposes a bulk-load scheme that allows fast loading of arbitrarily large RDF graphs into a database. Specifically, three modes of load are supported: i) loading into an empty RDF graph, ii) appending to a non-empty RDF graph, and iii) concurrent loads into multiple graphs. The bulk-load scheme is implemented as part of Oracle database semantic technologies and the performance experiments conducted with a variety of RDF graphs (from UniProt and synthesized data of Lehigh University Benchmark) demonstrate the scalability of the approach. The paper outlines the challenges involved in bulk- loading of large RDF graphs, describes the bulk-load scheme, discusses its implementation, and presents a performance study.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation"], "authors": ["Souripriya Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Souripriya", "Eugene Inseok Chong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chong:Eugene_Inseok", "Zhe Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Zhe", "Melliyal Annamalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Annamalai:Melliyal", "Jagannathan Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Jagannathan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
