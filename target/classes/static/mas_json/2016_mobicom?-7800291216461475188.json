Yet existing orientation tracking systems commonly require motion sensors that are only available on battery-powered devices. In this paper, we propose Tagyro, which attaches an array of passive RFID tags as orientation sensors on everyday objects. Tagyro uses a closed-form model to transform the run-time phase offsets between tags into orientation angle. To enable orientation tracking in 3D space, we found the key challenge lies in the imperfect radiation pattern of practical tags, caused by the antenna polarity, non-isotropic emission and electromagnetic coupling, which substantially distort phase measurement. We address these challenges by designing a set of phase sampling and recovery algorithms, which together enable reliable orientation sensing with 3 degrees of freedom. We have implemented a real-time version of Tagyro on a commodity RFID system. Our experiments show that Tagyro can track the 3D orientation of passive objects with a small error of 4\u00b0, at a processing rate of 37.7 samples per second.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Teng Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Teng", "Xinyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xinyu"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
