{"title": "On using existing time-use study data for ubiquitous computing applications.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "mobile computing", "data science", "diary studies", "inference"], "abstract": "Governments and commercial institutions have conducted detailed time-use studies for several decades. In these studies, participants give a detailed record of their activities, locations, and other data over a day, week, or longer period. These studies are particularly valuable for the ubicomp community because of the large number of participants (often the tens of thousands), and because of their public availability. In this paper, we show how to use the data from these studies to provide validated and cheap (although noisy) classifiers, baseline metrics, and other benefits for activity inference applications.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "departments": ["PARC", "PARC"], "authors": ["Kurt Partridge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Partridge:Kurt", "Philippe Golle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golle:Philippe"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
