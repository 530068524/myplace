{"title": "Understanding deja reviewers.", "fields": ["nudge theory", "knowledge management", "online community", "deja vu", "text processing"], "abstract": "People who review products on the web invest considerable time and energy in what they write. So why would someone write a review that restates earlier reviews? Our work looks to answer this question. In this paper, we present a mixed-method study of deja reviewers, latecomers who echo what other people said. We analyze nearly 100,000 Amazon.com reviews for signs of repetition and find that roughly 10-15% of reviews substantially resemble previous ones. Using these algorithmically-identified reviews as centerpieces for discussion, we interviewed reviewers to understand their motives. An overwhelming number of reviews partially explains deja reviews, but deeper factors revolving around an individual's status in the community are also at work. The paper concludes by introducing a new idea inspired by our findings: a self-aware community that nudges members toward community-wide goals.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Eric Gilbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilbert:Eric", "Karrie Karahalios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karahalios:Karrie"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
