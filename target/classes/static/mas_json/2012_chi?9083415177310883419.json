Scale costs time. Such time also means that potential avenues of exploration are ignored because the costs are perceived to be too high to run or even propose them. With  sampleAction  we have explored whether interaction techniques to present query results running over only incremental samples can be presented as sufficiently trustworthy for analysts both to make closer to real time decisions about their queries and to be more exploratory in their questions of the data. Our work with three teams of analysts suggests that we can indeed accelerate and open up the query process with such incremental visualizations.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Southampton", "Microsoft", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Danyel Fisher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fisher:Danyel", "Igor O.
