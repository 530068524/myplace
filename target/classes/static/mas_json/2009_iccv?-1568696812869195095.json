{"title": "A biased sampling strategy for object categorization.", "fields": ["data set", "contextual image classification", "salience", "probabilistic logic", "sampling bias"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a biased sampling strategy for object class modeling, which can effectively circumvent the scene matching problem commonly encountered in statistical image-based object categorization. The method optimally combines the bottom-up, biologically inspired saliency information with loose, top-down class prior information to form a probabilistic distribution for feature sampling. When sampling over different positions and scales of patches, the weak spatial coherency is preserved by a segment-based analysis. We evaluate the proposed sampling strategy within the bag-of-features (BoF) object categorization framework on three public data sets. Our technique outperforms other state-of-the-art sampling technologies, and leads to a better performance in object categorization on VOC2008 dataset.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Intel", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Lei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Lei", "Nanning Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Nanning", "Jie Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Jie", "Mei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Mei", "Hong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hong"], "pages": 8}
