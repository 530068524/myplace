A severe limitation is the inability to model multiple objects that are merged into a single measurement, and track them as a group, while retaining optimality. This work presents a new graph structure that encodes these multiple-match events as standard one-to-one matches, allowing computation of the solution in polynomial time. Since identities are lost when objects merge, an efficient method to identify groups is also presented, as a flow circulation problem. The problem of tracking individual objects across groups is then posed as a standard optimal assignment. Experiments show increased performance on the PETS 2006 and 2009 datasets compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (121)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Coimbra", "University of Coimbra", "University of Coimbra"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jo\u00e3o F.
