{"title": "Exploring the Duality in Conflict-Directed Model-Based Diagnosis.", "fields": ["medical diagnosis", "exploit", "cardinality", "duality", "machine learning"], "abstract": "A model-based diagnosis problem occurs when an observation is inconsistent with the assumption that the diagnosed system is not faulty. The task of a diagnosis engine is to compute diagnoses, which are assumptions on the health of components in the diagnosed system that explain the observation. In this paper, we extend Reiter's well-known theory of diagnosis by exploiting the duality of the relation between conflicts and diagnoses. This duality means that a diagnosis is a hitting set of conflicts, but a conflict is also a hitting set of diagnoses. We use this property to interleave the search for diagnoses and conflicts: a set of conflicts can guide the search for diagnosis, and the computed diagnoses can guide the search for more conflicts. We provide the formal basis for this dual conflict-diagnosis relation, and propose a novel diagnosis algorithm that exploits this duality. Experimental results show that the new algorithm is able to find a minimal cardinality diagnosis faster than the well-known Conflict-Directed A.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University College Cork", "University College Cork"], "authors": ["Roni Tzvi Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Roni_Tzvi", "Meir Kalech.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalech:Meir", "Alexander Feldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldman:Alexander", "Gregory M.
