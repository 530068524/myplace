We notice that, as far as two labels are concerned, BSG parsing is equivalent to approximating a facade by a matrix with multiple rank-one patterns. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to decompose an arbitrary matrix into a rank-one matrix and a residual matrix, whose magnitude is small in the sense of l 0 -norm. Next, we develop a block-wise partition method to parse a more general facade. Our method leverages on the recent breakthroughs in convex optimization that can effectively decompose a matrix into a low-rank and sparse matrix pair. The rank-one block-wise parsing not only leads to the detection of repetitive patterns, but also gives an accurate facade segmentation. Experiments on intensive facade data sets have demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques and benchmarks both in robustness and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Chao", "Tian Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Tian", "Long Quan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quan:Long", "Chiew-Lan Tai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tai:Chiew=Lan"], "pages": 8}
