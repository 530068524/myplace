{"title": "Virtual reality in the wild: A self-contained and wearable simulation system.", "fields": ["situated", "immersion", "computer mediated reality", "software system", "use case"], "abstract": "We implement and describe a computer simulation system that takes virtual reality technology beyond specialized laboratories and research sites, and makes them available in any space, such as a high-school gymnasium or a public park. Our hardware and software systems enable HMD-based immersive virtual reality simulations to be conducted in any arbitrary location with no external infrastructure and little-to-no setup required. We demonstrate the ability of this system to provide realistically motion-tracked navigation for users and to generate usable behavioral data by having participants navigate through a full-scale virtual grocery store while physically situated in a grassy field. Applications for behavioral research and use cases for other fields are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Miami University", "Miami University", "Miami University", "Miami University", "Miami University"], "authors": ["Eric Hodgson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hodgson:Eric", "Eric R.
