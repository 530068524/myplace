This paper formulates image categorization as a multi-label classification problem using recent advances in matrix completion. Under this setting, classification of testing data is posed as a problem of completing unknown label entries on a data matrix that concatenates training and testing features with training labels. We propose two convex algorithms for matrix completion based on a Rank Minimization criterion specifically tailored to visual data, and prove its convergence properties. A major advantage of our approach w.r.t. standard discriminative classification methods for image categorization is its robustness to outliers, background noise and partial occlusions both in the feature and label space. Experimental validation on several datasets shows how our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, while effectively capturing semantic concepts of classes.", "citation": "Citations (142)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico"], "authors": ["Ricardo Silveira Cabral.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cabral:Ricardo_Silveira", "Fernando De la Torre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torre:Fernando_De_la", "Jo\u00e3o Paulo Costeira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costeira:Jo=atilde=o_Paulo", "Alexandre Bernardino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bernardino:Alexandre"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
