{"title": "Decoupling Sparsity and Smoothness in the Discrete Hierarchical Dirichlet Process.", "fields": ["hierarchical dirichlet process", "smoothness", "topic model", "dirichlet distribution", "latent dirichlet allocation"], "abstract": "We present a nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian model of document collections that decouples sparsity and smoothness in the component distributions (i.e., the \"topics\"). In the sparse topic model (sparseTM), each topic is represented by a bank of selector variables that determine which terms appear in the topic. Thus each topic is associated with a subset of the vocabulary, and topic smoothness is modeled on this subset. We develop an efficient Gibbs sampler for the sparseTM that includes a general-purpose method for sampling from a Dirichlet mixture with a combinatorial number of components. We demonstrate the sparseTM on four real-world datasets. Compared to traditional approaches, the empirical results will show that sparseTMs give better predictive performance with simpler inferred models.", "citation": "Citations (110)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Chong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Chong", "David M.
