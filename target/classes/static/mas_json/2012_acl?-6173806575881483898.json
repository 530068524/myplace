{"title": "Strong Lexicalization of Tree Adjoining Grammars.", "fields": ["context sensitive grammar", "regular tree grammar", "l attributed grammar", "phrase structure grammar", "indexed grammar"], "abstract": "Recently, it was shown (KUHLMANN, SATTA: Tree-adjoining grammars are not closed under strong lexicalization. Comput. Linguist., 2012) that finitely ambiguous tree adjoining grammars cannot be transformed into a normal form (preserving the generated tree language), in which each production contains a lexical symbol. A more powerful model, the simple context-free tree grammar, admits such a normal form. It can be effectively constructed and the maximal rank of the nonterminals only increases by 1. Thus, simple context-free tree grammars strongly lexicalize tree adjoining grammars and themselves.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "Leiden University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Andreas Maletti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maletti:Andreas", "Joost Engelfriet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Engelfriet:Joost"], "pages": 10}
