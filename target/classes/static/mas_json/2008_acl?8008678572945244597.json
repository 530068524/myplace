Our contributions include (1) using a meta-model to analyze the incorrect biases of a model in a systematic way, (2) providing an efficient and robust method of measuring distance between two parameter settings of a model, and (3) showing that local optima issues which typically plague EM can be somewhat alleviated by increasing the number of training examples. We conduct our analyses on three models: the HMM, the PCFG, and a simple dependency model.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy", "Dan Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Dan"], "pages": 9}
