Reconstruction is challenging due to four reasons\u2013the sparsity of the strokes, their ambiguity, their large number, and their inter-relations. Our approach is able to reconstruct a model from a complex drawing that consists of many inter-related strokes. Rather than viewing the inter-dependencies as a problem, we show how they can be exploited to automatically generate a good initial interpretation of the line drawing. Then, given a base and an interpretation, we propose an algorithm for reconstructing a consistent surface. The strength of our approach is demonstrated in the reconstruction of archaeological artifacts from drawings. These drawings are highly challenging, since artists created very complex and detailed descriptions of artifacts regardless of any considerations concerning their future use for shape reconstruction.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Haifa", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michael Kolomenkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolomenkin:Michael", "George Leifman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leifman:George", "Ilan Shimshoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimshoni:Ilan", "Ayellet Tal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tal:Ayellet"], "pages": 8}
