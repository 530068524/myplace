{"title": "Chinese Song Iambics Generation with Neural Attention-Based Model.", "fields": ["machine translation", "initialization", "language model", "rhythm", "encoder"], "abstract": "Learning and generating Chinese poems is a charming yet challenging task. Traditional approaches involve various language modeling and machine translation techniques, however, they perform not as well when generating poems with complex pattern constraints, for example Song iambics, a famous type of poems that involve variable-length sentences and strict rhythmic patterns.\n\nThis paper applies the attention-based sequence-to-sequence model to generate Chinese Song iambics. Specifically, we encode the cue sentences by a bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model and then predict the entire iambic with the information provided by the encoder, in the form of an attention-based LSTM that can regularize the generation process by the fine structure of the input cues. Several techniques are investigated to improve the model, including global context integration, hybrid style training, character vector initialization and adaptation. Both the automatic and subjective evaluation results show that our model indeed can learn the complex structural and rhythmic patterns of Song iambics, and the generation is rather successful.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Qixin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qixin", "Tianyi Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Tianyi", "Dong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0013:Dong", "Chao Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Chao"], "pages": 7}
