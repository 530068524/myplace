However, these methods require an expensive decoding procedure to recover the multiple labels of each testing instance. The testing complexity becomes unacceptable when there are many labels. To avoid decoding completely, we present a novel large margin metric learning paradigm for multi-label prediction. In particular, the proposed method learns a distance metric to discover label dependency such that instances with very different multiple labels will be moved far away. To handle many labels, we present an accelerated proximal gradient procedure to speed up the learning process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is significantly faster than CCA and MMOC in terms of both training and testing complexities. Moreover, our method achieves superior prediction performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "authors": ["Weiwei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Weiwei", "Ivor W.
