To address ONB problems, some researchers have proposed model-based approaches that can expose ONBs by analyzing natural language requirements documents. While these approaches produced promising results, they require a lot of human effort and time. In this paper, to reduce human effort and time, we propose a combinatorial-based approach, Combinatorial Causal Component Model (Combi-CCM), which uses structured requirements patterns and combinations generated using the IPOG algorithm. We conducted an empirical study using several requirements documents to evaluate our approach, and our results indicate that the proposed approach can reduce human effort and time while maintaining the same ONB exposure ability obtained by the control techniques.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of North Texas", "University of North Texas", "DISTek Integration, Inc."], "authors": ["Kaushik Madala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madala:Kaushik", "Hyunsook Do.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Do:Hyunsook", "Daniel Aceituna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aceituna:Daniel"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
