Using an unprecedented 13,680 nodes (437,760 cores) of the Cray XE6 \"Blue Waters\" at NCSA at the University of Illinois, researchers achieved a sustained rate of 285 Tflops while simulating an 18-hour forecast. A grid of size 9120x9216x48 (1.4Tbytes of input) was used, with horizontal resolution of 500 meters and a 2-second time step. 86 Gbytes of forecast data was written every 6 forecast hours at a rate of up to 2 Gbytes/second and collaboratively post-processed and displayed using the Vapor suite at NCAR. Opportunities to enhance scalability in the source code, run-time, and operating system realms were exploited. The output of this numerical model is now under study for model validation.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Cray", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "National Center for Atmospheric Research", "National Center for Atmospheric Research", "National Center for Atmospheric Research"], "authors": ["Peter Johnsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnsen:Peter", "Mark Straka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Straka:Mark", "Melvyn Shapiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shapiro:Melvyn", "Alan Norton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norton:Alan", "Thomas Galarneau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galarneau:Thomas"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2013", "pages": 7}
