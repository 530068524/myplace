However, in a distributed setting, some processes may be written in languages that do not support static typing of sessions or may be compromised by a malicious intruder, violating invariants of the session types. In such a setting, dynamically monitoring communication between processes becomes a necessity for identifying undesirable actions. In this paper, we show how to dynamically monitor communication to enforce adherence to session types in a higher-order setting. We present a system of blame assignment in the case when the monitor detects an undesirable action and an alarm is raised. We prove that dynamic monitoring does not change system behavior for welltyped processes, and that one of an indicated set of possible culprits must have been compromised in case of an alarm.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Limin Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Limin", "Hannah Gommerstadt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gommerstadt:Hannah", "Frank Pfenning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfenning:Frank"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
