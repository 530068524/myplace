{"title": "Can mobile cloudlets support mobile applications?", "fields": ["cloudlet", "mobile device", "mobile computing", "mobile technology", "mobile search"], "abstract": "A mobile cloudlet is a set of resource-rich mobile devices\u2014referred to as cloudlet nodes\u2014that an initiator mobile device can connect to for services. In this paper, we examine the fundamental mobile cloudlet properties that unfoldwhether and when a mobile cloudlet can provide mobile application ser- vice. Specifically, we investigate thecloudlet size,cloudlet node's lifetime and reachable time. Traces and mathematical analysis demonstrate that 1) the more frequently mobile devices meet, the larger the pool of computing resources an initiator can access; 2) intermittent connection between devices has little adverse effect on the optimal computing performance of mobile cloudlet in the long run; 3) the ratio E(TC)/(E(TI) + E(TC)) indicates the connection likelihood of an initiator and a cloudlet node (i.e., reachability of the cloudlet node), where TC and TI are their contact and inter-contact time. We further derive upper and lower bounds on computing capacity and computing speed of a mobile cloudlet. An initiator can use both bounds to decide whether to offload its task to remote clouds or local mobile cloudlets for better mobile application services.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Yujin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yujin", "Wenye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wenye"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
