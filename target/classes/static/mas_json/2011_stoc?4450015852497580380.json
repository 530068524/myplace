At each time, during the execution of P, Bob is able to see the addresses of the memory cells involved in the instruction which is executed and the name of the instruction. In addition to this, at certain times, Bob can even see the contents of all of the memory cells involved in the instruction. We will call a time when this happens a compromised time. Bob can choose the compromised times in an adaptive way, that is, immediately before the instruction at time t is executed, Bob, using all of the information at his disposal, can decide whether time t will be compromised or not. The only restriction on his choice is, that among m consecutive instructions there can be at most e m whose time is compromised, where e>0 is a small constant. We show that if m= c\u230a log n \u230b, where c>0 is a large constant, then for each program P, using  n  memory cells and time T=O(poly(n)), Alice can construct a functionally equivalent program P', such that the probability that Bob gets any nontrivial information about the input of P is negligible, and the time and space requirements of P' grows, compared to P, only by a factor of poly(log n). We assume that the program P' gets its input in an encoded form, namely each input bit b is encoded by a random 0,1-sequence of length m whose parity is b. The output bits must be encoded by P' in a similar way.   As part of the proof of the result described above we also construct for all positive integers m, and for all boolean circuits C of size n a functionally equivalent circuit C' of size O(n poly(m)) with the following properties. Assume that an adversary can observe each bit going through the wires of the circuit C' independently with a probability of e, where e>0 is a small constant, and each input/output bit of C is encoded by  m  input/output bits of C' the same way as described above for RAMs. Then, such an adversary, while observing C', can get any information about the input/output of the circuit C only with a probability of ne -cm , where c>0 is a constant.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["IBM"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Mikl\u00f3s Ajtai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ajtai:Mikl=oacute=s"], "pages": 10}
