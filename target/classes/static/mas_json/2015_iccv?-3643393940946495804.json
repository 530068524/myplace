In this paper, we propose a joint solution that tackles semantic object and part segmentation simultaneously, in which higher object-level context is provided to guide part segmentation, and more detailed part-level localization is utilized to refine object segmentation. Specifically, we first introduce the concept of semantic compositional parts (SCP) in which similar semantic parts are grouped and shared among different objects. A two-stream fully convolutional network (FCN) is then trained to provide the SCP and object potentials at each pixel. At the same time, a compact set of segments can also be obtained from the SCP predictions of the network. Given the potentials and the generated segments, in order to explore long-range context, we finally construct an efficient fully connected conditional random field (FCRF) to jointly predict the final object and part labels. Extensive evaluation on three different datasets shows that our approach can mutually enhance the performance of object and part segmentation, and outperforms the current state-of-the-art on both tasks.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Peng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Peng", "Xiaohui Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xiaohui", "Zhe L.
