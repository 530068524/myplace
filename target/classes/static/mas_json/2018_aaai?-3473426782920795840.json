More recently, unsupervised generative models based on neural networks have been successfully applied to model data distributions via low-dimensional latent spaces. In this paper, we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to impose structure in compressed sensing problems, replacing the usual sparsity constraint. We propose to train the GANs in a task-aware fashion, specifically for reconstruction tasks. We also show that it is possible to train our model without using any (or much) non-compressed data. Finally, we show that the latent space of the GAN carries discriminative information and can further be regularized to generate input features for general inference tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of reconstruction and classification problems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Maya Kabkab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kabkab:Maya", "Pouya Samangouei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samangouei:Pouya", "Rama Chellappa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chellappa:Rama"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
