{"title": "Efficiently Answering Technical Questions - A Knowledge Graph Approach.", "fields": ["graph", "online search", "random walk", "ask price", "search engine"], "abstract": "More and more users prefer to ask their technical questions online. For machines, understanding a question is nontrivial. Current approaches lack explicit background knowledge.In this paper, we introduce a novel technical question understanding approach to recommending probable solutions to users. First, a knowledge graph is constructed which contains abundant technical information, and an augmented knowledge graph is built on the basis of the knowledge graph, to link the knowledge graph and documents. Then we develop a light weight question driven mechanism to select candidate documents. To improve the online performance, we propose an index-based random walk to support the online search. We use comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a large scale of real-world query logs. Our system outperforms main-stream search engine and the state-of-art information retrieval methods. Meanwhile, extensive experiments confirm the efficiency of our index-based online search mechanism.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Renmin University of China"], "authors": ["Shuo Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shuo", "Lei Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou_0001:Lei", "Zhongyuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhongyuan", "Jun Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan_0001:Jun", "Ji-Rong Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Ji=Rong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
