{"title": "An Event Driven Fusion Approach for Enjoyment Recognition in Real-time.", "fields": ["special interest group", "emotion classification", "annotation", "asynchronous communication", "modalities"], "abstract": "Social signals and interpretation of carried information is of high importance in Human Computer Interaction. Often used for affect recognition, the cues within these signals are displayed in various modalities. Fusion of multi-modal signals is a natural and interesting way to improve automatic classification of emotions transported in social signals. Throughout most present studies, uni-modal affect recognition as well as multi-modal fusion, decisions are forced for fixed annotation segments across all modalities. In this paper, we investigate the less prevalent approach of event driven fusion, which indirectly accumulates asynchronous events in all modalities for final predictions. We present a fusion approach, handling short-timed events in a vector space, which is of special interest for real-time applications. We compare results of segmentation based uni-modal classification and fusion schemes to the event driven fusion approach. The evaluation is carried out via detection of enjoyment-episodes within the audiovisual Belfast Story-Telling Corpus.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Augsburg", "University of Augsburg", "University of Augsburg", "Queen's University Belfast", "Queen's University Belfast"], "authors": ["Florian Lingenfelser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lingenfelser:Florian", "Johannes Wagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagner_0001:Johannes", "Elisabeth Andr\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andr=eacute=:Elisabeth", "Gary McKeown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McKeown:Gary", "William Curran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curran:William"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
