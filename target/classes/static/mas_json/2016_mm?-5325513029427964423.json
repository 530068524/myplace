{"title": "Pyo, the Python DSP toolbox.", "fields": ["python", "graphical user interface", "toolbox", "digital signal processing", "computation"], "abstract": "This paper introduces pyo, a python module dedicated to the digital processing of sound. This audio engine distinguishes itself from other alternatives by being natively integrated to a common general programming language. This integration allows incorporating audio processes quickly to other programming tasks, like mathematical computations, network communications or graphical interface programming. We will expose the main features of the library as well as the different contexts of use where pyo can be of a great benefit to composers and audio software developers.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Olivier B\u00e9langer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=eacute=langer:Olivier"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
