{"title": "Transformation Networks for Target-Oriented Sentiment Classification.", "fields": ["machine learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "sentence"], "abstract": "Target-oriented sentiment classification aims at classifying sentiment polarities over individual opinion targets in a sentence. RNN with attention seems a good fit for the characteristics of this task, and indeed it achieves the state-of-the-art performance. After re-examining the drawbacks of attention mechanism and the obstacles that block CNN to perform well in this classification task, we propose a new model to overcome these issues. Instead of attention, our model employs a CNN layer to extract salient features from the transformed word representations originated from a bi-directional RNN layer. Between the two layers, we propose a component to generate target-specific representations of words in the sentence, meanwhile incorporate a mechanism for preserving the original contextual information from the RNN layer. Experiments show that our model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on a few benchmarks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Tencent", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Wai Lam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lam:Wai", "Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xin", "Bei Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Bei", "Lidong Bing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bing:Lidong"], "pages": 11}
