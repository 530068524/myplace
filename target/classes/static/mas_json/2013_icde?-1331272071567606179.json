{"title": "Query time scaling of attribute values in interval timestamped databases.", "fields": ["query by example", "timestamping", "sargable", "timestamp", "tuple"], "abstract": "In valid-time databases with interval timestamping each tuple is associated with a time interval over which the recorded fact is true in the modeled reality. The adjustment of these intervals is an essential part of processing interval timestamped data. Some attribute values remain valid if the associated interval changes, whereas others have to be scaled along with the time interval. For example, attributes that record total (cumulative) quantities over time, such as project budgets, total sales or total costs, often must be scaled if the timestamp is adjusted. The goal of this demo is to show how to support the scaling of attribute values in SQL at query time.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano"], "authors": ["Anton Dign\u00f6s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dign=ouml=s:Anton", "Michael H.
