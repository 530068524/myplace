In this paper, we focus on incentivizing crowd workers to label a set of binary tasks under strict budget constraint. We properly profile the tasks' difficulty levels and workers' quality in crowdsourcing systems, where the collected labels are aggregated with sequential Bayesian approach. To stimulate workers to undertake crowd labeling tasks, the interaction between workers and the platform is modeled as a reverse auction. We reveal that the platform utility maximization could be intractable, for which an incentive mechanism that determines the winning bid and payments with polynomial-time computation complexity is developed. Moreover, we theoretically prove that our mechanism is truthful, individually rational and budget feasible. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our mechanism utilizes budget efficiently to achieve high platform utility with polynomial computation complexity.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Qi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qi", "Yutian Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Yutian", "Xiaohua Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Xiaohua", "Xiaoying Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Xiaoying", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
