Our contributions include a new notion of trapdoor function with  preimage sampling , simple and efficient \"hash-and-sign\" digital signature schemes, and identity-based encryption. A core technical component of our constructions is an efficient algorithm that, given a basis of an arbitrary lattice, samples lattice points from a  discrete Gaussian  probability distribution whose standard deviation is essentially the length of the longest Gram-Schmidt vector of the basis. A crucial security property is that the output distribution of the algorithm is oblivious to the particular geometry of the given basis.", "citation": "Citations (1,315)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Stanford University", "SRI International", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Craig Gentry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentry:Craig", "Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris", "Vinod Vaikuntanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaikuntanathan:Vinod"], "pages": 10}
