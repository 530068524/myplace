While recent research has shown that coarse-grained CFI does not stop attacks, fine-grained CFI is believed to be secure.\n\nWe argue that assessing the effectiveness of practical CFI implementations is non-trivial and that common evaluation metrics fail to do so. We then evaluate fullyprecise static CFI -- the most restrictive CFI policy that does not break functionality -- and reveal limitations in its security. Using a generalization of non-control-data attacks which we call Control-Flow Bending (CFB), we show how an attacker can leverage a memory corruption vulnerability to achieve Turing-complete computation on memory using just calls to the standard library. We use this attack technique to evaluate fully-precise static CFI on six real binaries and show that in five out of six cases, powerful attacks are still possible. Our results suggest that CFI may not be a reliable defense against memory corruption vulnerabilities.\n\nWe further evaluate shadow stacks in combination with CFI and find that their presence for security is necessary: deploying shadow stacks removes arbitrary code execution capabilities of attackers in three of six cases.", "citation": "Citations (169)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "ETH Zurich", "Purdue University", "University of California, Berkeley", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Nicholas Carlini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carlini:Nicholas", "Antonio Barresi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barresi:Antonio", "Mathias Payer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Payer:Mathias", "David A.
