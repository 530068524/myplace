GDA agents have performed well on such tasks by integrating methods for discrepancy recognition, explanation, goal formulation, and goal management. However, they require substantial domain knowledge, including what constitutes a discrepancy and how to resolve it. We introduce LGDA, a learning algorithm for acquiring this knowledge, modeled as cases, that and integrates case-based reasoning and reinforcement learning methods. We assess its utility on tasks from a complex video game environment. We claim that, for these tasks, LGDA can significantly outperform its ablations. Our evaluation provides evidence to support this claim. LGDA exemplifies a feasible design methodology for deployable GDA agents.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Lehigh University", "Lehigh University", "United States Naval Research Laboratory"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Ulit Jaidee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaidee:Ulit", "H\u00e9ctor Mu\u00f1oz-Avila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mu=ntilde=oz=Avila:H=eacute=ctor", "David W.
