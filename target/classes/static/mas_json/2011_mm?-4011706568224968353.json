Complex relations between images, extracted visual features, text associated with the images as well as users and their social network are modeled using a multimodal graph. To compute affinities between nodes in the graph we rely on the proven concept of random walk with restarts. The novelty of our approach lies in its use of the multimodal graph to create a diverse, yet representative, image set. Further, we introduce an edge-weighting mechanism for the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. We evaluate our summaries with a new protocol that tests for representativeness and diversity using image geo-coordinates and is independent of the need for human evaluators. The experiments, performed on a set of Flickr images, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Stevan Rudinac.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudinac:Stevan", "Alan Hanjalic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanjalic:Alan", "Martha Larson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larson:Martha"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
