{"title": "SDP Integrality Gaps with Local ell_1-Embeddability.", "fields": ["linear programming relaxation", "hypercube", "log log plot", "triangle inequality", "maximum cut"], "abstract": "We construct integrality gap instances for SDP relaxation of the Maximum Cut and the Sparsest Cut problems. It is well-known that if the triangle inequality constraints were added to the SDP, then the SDP vectors naturally define an n-point negative type (or ell_2^2) metric where n is the number of vertices in the problem instance. Our gap-instances have the property that every sub-metric on t = O((log log log n)^{1/6}) points is isometrically embeddable into ell_1. The local ell_1-embeddability constraints are implied when the basic SDP relaxation is augmented with t rounds of the Sherali-Adams LP-relaxation. For the Maximum Cut problem, we obtain an optimal gap of alpha_{GW}^{-1} - eps, where alpha_{GW} is the Goemans-Williamson constant and eps \u226b 0 is an arbitrarily small constant. For the Sparsest Cut problem, we obtain a gap of Omega((log log log n)^{1/13}). The latter result can be rephrased as a construction of an n-point negative type metric such that every t-point sub-metric is isometrically ell_1-embeddable, but embedding the whole metric into ell_1 incurs distortion Omega((log log log n)^{1/13}).", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["New York University", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Subhash Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Subhash", "Rishi Saket.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saket:Rishi"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
