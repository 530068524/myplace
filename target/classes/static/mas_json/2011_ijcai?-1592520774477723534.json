{"title": "Social Instruments for Robust Convention Emergence.", "fields": ["convergence", "machine learning", "social network", "leverage", "convention"], "abstract": "We present the notion of Social Instruments as mechanisms that facilitate the emergence of conventions from repeated interactions between members of a society. Specifically, we focus on two social instruments: rewiring and observation. Our main goal is to provide agents with tools that allow them to leverage their social network of interactions when effectively addressing coordination and learning problems, paying special attention to dissolving metastable subconventions. Our initial experiments throw some light on how Self-Reinforcing Substructures (SRS) in the network prevent full convergence to society-wide conventions, resulting in reduced convergence rates. The use of an effective composed social instrument, observation + rewiring, allow agents to achieve convergence by eliminating the subconventions that otherwise remained meta-stable.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council", "University of Tulsa"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Daniel Villatoro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villatoro:Daniel", "Jordi Sabater-Mir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabater=Mir:Jordi", "Sandip Sen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sen:Sandip"], "pages": 6}
