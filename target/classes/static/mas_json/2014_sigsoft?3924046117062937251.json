{"title": "CHOReOSynt: enforcing choreography realizability in the future internet.", "fields": ["realizability", "choreography", "service choreography", "reuse", "enforcement"], "abstract": "Choreographies are an emergent Service Engineering (SE) approach to compose together and coordinate services in a distributed way. A choreography formalizes the way business participants coordinate their interactions. The focus is not on orchestrations of the work performed within them, but rather on the exchange of messages between these participants. The problems usually addressed when considering a choreography-based specification of the system to be realized are realizability check, and conformance check. In this paper we describe the CHOReOSynt tool, which has been conceived to deal with an additional problem, namely, automated choreography enforcement. That is, when the goal is to actually realize a service choreography by reusing third-party services, their uncontrolled (or wrongly coordinated) composite behavior may show undesired interactions that preclude the choreography realization. CHOReOSynt solves this problem by automatically synthesizing additional software entities that, when interposed among the services, allow for preventing undesired interactions.
