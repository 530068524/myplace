This learning problem arises frequently in many application areas ranging from signal processing, computer vision, over robotics to computer graphics. We present a new algorithmic scheme for the solution of this general learning problem based on regularized empirical risk minimization. The regularization functional takes into account the geometry of input and output manifold, and we show that it implements a prior which is particularly natural. Moreover, we demonstrate that our algorithm performs well in a difficult surface registration problem.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Saarland University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Florian Steinke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinke:Florian", "Matthias Hein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hein_0001:Matthias"], "pages": 8}
