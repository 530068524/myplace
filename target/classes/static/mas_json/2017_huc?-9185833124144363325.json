In these air-cons, the user specifies their comfort requirements on an inbuilt thermostat through infrared (IR) based remotes. State-of-the-art thermostats emulate the AC remotes and assist occupants in remotely changing the thermostat temperature, through their smartphones. The room-level control together with buildings' poor thermal insulation makes air-cons an attractive target for energy conservation. In this work, we explore grey-box modeling techniques to upgrade the commercial thermostats for - 1. actionable feedback, 2. energy-efficient control, and 3. corrective feedback. We plan to address these three core issues and develop portable and ubiquitous thermostats that leverage easy-to-collect ambient information to optimise the AC operations while ensuring the user comfort. The aim of this work is to achieve comfortable energy-savings for the users with minimal interference from the sensors.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology"], "authors": ["Milan Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Milan"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
