To tackle this question, our study consists of three components. First, we introduce a stylized stochastic model for recommendation diffusion. Such a model allows us to highlight the connection between user experience at the individual level, and network efficiency at the macroscopic level. We also propose a set of metrics for quantifying both user experience and network efficiency. Second, based on these metrics, we extensively study the tradeoff between the two factors in a Yelp dataset, concluding that Yelp's social network is surprisingly efficient, though not optimal. Finally, we design a friend recommendation and news feed curation algorithm that can simultaneously address individuals' need to connect to high-quality friends, and service providers' need to maximize network efficiency in information propagation.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Felix Ming Fai Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Felix_Ming_Fai", "Zhenming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhenming", "Mung Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang:Mung"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
