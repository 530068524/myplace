{"title": "Metamodel-based tool integration with moflon.", "fields": ["maintainability", "graph rewriting", "model driven software development", "metacomputing", "software development process"], "abstract": "Nowadays, a typical software development process involves many developers which participate in the development process by using a wide variety of development tools. As a consequence, the data representing the project as a whole is distributed over different development tools. For the purpose of consistency, maintainability, and traceability it is an essential task to be aware of the relationships between semantic equivalent data in different tool repositories. The real-time systems Lab at the Technische Universitat Darmstadt performs research in the area of tool and metamodel integration to provide solutions to overcome this gap. In this demonstration we present the metamodeling framework MOFLON that addresses these issues by bringing together the latest OMG standards with graph transformations and triple graph grammars. Using MOFLON, developers can generate code for specific tools needed to perform analysis and transformation on one development tool or to incrementally integrate data of different modeling tools.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Real-Time Syst. ... tadt, Darmstadt", "Real-Time Syst. ... tadt, Darmstadt", "Real-Time Syst. ... tadt, Darmstadt", "Real-Time Syst. ... tadt, Darmstadt", "Real-Time Syst. ... tadt, Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Carsten Amelunxen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amelunxen:Carsten", "Felix Klar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klar:Felix", "Alexander K\u00f6nigs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=nigs:Alexander", "Tobias R\u00f6tschke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=ouml=tschke:Tobias", "Andy Sch\u00fcrr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=rr:Andy"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
