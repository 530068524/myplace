{"title": "Recursive Inversion Models for Permutations.", "fields": ["recursion", "statistical model", "exponential family", "estimation theory", "permutation"], "abstract": "We develop a new exponential family probabilistic model for permutations that can capture hierarchical structure and that has the Mallows and generalized Mallows models as subclasses. We describe how to do parameter estimation and propose an approach to structure search for this class of models. We provide experimental evidence that this added flexibility both improves predictive performance and enables a deeper understanding of collections of permutations.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Microsoft", "University of Washington"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Christopher Meek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meek:Christopher", "Marina Meila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meila:Marina"], "pages": 9}
