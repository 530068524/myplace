{"title": "A cross-protocol attack on the TLS protocol.", "fields": ["brute force attack", "chosen ciphertext attack", "reflection attack", "man in the middle attack", "pre play attack"], "abstract": "This paper describes a cross-protocol attack on all versions of TLS; it can be seen as an extension of the Wagner and Schneier attack on SSL 3.0. The attack presents valid explicit elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman parameters signed by a server to a client that incorrectly interprets these parameters as valid plain Diffie-Hellman parameters. Our attack enables an adversary to successfully impersonate a server to a random client after obtaining 2 40  signed elliptic curve keys from the original server. While attacking a specific client is improbable due to the high number of signed keys required during the lifetime of one TLS handshake, it is not completely unrealistic for a setting where the server has high computational power and the attacker contents itself with recovering one out of many session keys. We remark that popular open-source server implementations are not susceptible to this attack, since they typically do not support the explicit curve option. Finally we propose a fix that renders the protocol immune to this family of cross-protocol attacks.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of Luxembourg", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mavrogiannopoulos:Nikos", "Frederik Vercauteren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vercauteren:Frederik", "Vesselin Velichkov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Velichkov:Vesselin", "Bart Preneel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Preneel:Bart"], "pages": 11}
