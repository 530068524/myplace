Marasim is aimed at achieving the security of random images with the memorability of personal images. Our scheme relies on the human ability to remember a personal image and later recognize the alternate visual representations (images) of the concepts occurred in the image. These concepts are retrieved from the tags assigned to the image. We illustrate how a Jigsaw based approach helps to create a portfolio of system-chosen random images to be used for authentication. The paper describes the complete design of Marasim along with the empirical studies of Marasim that provide evidences of increased memorability. Results show that 93% of all participants succeeded in the authentication tests using Marasim after three months while 71% succeeded in authentication tests using Marasim after nine months. Our findings indicate that Marasim has potential applications, especially where text input is hard (e.g., PDAs or ATMs), or in situations where passwords are infrequently used (e.g., web site passwords).", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rohit Ashok Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Rohit_Ashok", "Kannan Srinathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinathan:Kannan", "Ponnurangam Kumaraguru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumaraguru:Ponnurangam"], "pages": 10}
