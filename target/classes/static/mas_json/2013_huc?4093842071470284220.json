In this paper, we study the effect of ESM design choices on the inferences that can be made from participants' sensor data, and on the variance in survey responses that can be collected. In particular, we answer the question: are the behavioural inferences that a researcher makes with a trigger-defined subsample of sensor data biased by the sampling strategy's design? We demonstrate that different single-sensor sampling strategies will result in what we refer to as contextual dissonance: a disagreement in how much different behaviours are represented in the aggregated sensor data. These results are not only relevant to researchers who use the ESM, but call for future work into strategies that may alleviate the biases that we measure.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Neal Lathia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lathia:Neal", "Kiran K.
