{"title": "Automatic Enforcement of Data Use Policies with DataLawyer.", "fields": ["enforcement", "relational database management system", "overhead", "database", "data mining"], "abstract": "Data has value and is increasingly being exchanged for commercial and research purposes. Data, however, is typically accompanied by terms of use, which limit how it can be used. To date, there are only a few, ad-hoc methods to enforce these terms. We propose DataLawyer, a new system to formally specify usage policies and check them automatically at query runtime in a relational database management system (DBMS). We develop a new model to specify policies compactly and precisely. We introduce novel algorithms to efficiently evaluate policies that can cut policy-checking overheads to only a few percent of the total query runtime. We implement DataLawyer and evaluate it on a real database from the health-care domain.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Prasang Upadhyaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Upadhyaya:Prasang", "Magdalena Balazinska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balazinska:Magdalena", "Dan Suciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suciu:Dan"], "pages": 13}
