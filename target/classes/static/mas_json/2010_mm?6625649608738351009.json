{"title": "KPB-SIFT: a compact local feature descriptor.", "fields": ["gloh", "curse of dimensionality", "principal curvature based region detector", "scale invariant feature transform", "feature"], "abstract": "Invariant feature descriptors such as SIFT and GLOH have been demonstrated to be very robust for image matching and object recognition. However, such descriptors are typically of high dimensionality, e.g. 128-dimension in the case of SIFT. This limits the performance of feature matching techniques in terms of speed and scalability. A new compact feature descriptor, called Kernel Projection Based SIFT (KPB-SIFT), is presented in this paper. Like SIFT, our descriptor encodes the salient aspects of image information in the feature point's neighborhood. However, instead of using SIFT's smoothed weighted histograms, we apply kernel projection techniques to orientation gradient patches. The produced KPB-SIFT descriptor is more compact as compared to the state-of-the-art, does not require pre-training step needed by PCA based descriptors, and shows superior advantages in terms of distinctiveness, invariance to scale, and tolerance of geometric distortions. We extensively evaluated the effectiveness of KPB-SIFT with datasets acquired under varying circumstances.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Gangqiang Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Gangqiang", "Ling Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Ling", "Gencai Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Gencai", "Junsong Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Junsong"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
