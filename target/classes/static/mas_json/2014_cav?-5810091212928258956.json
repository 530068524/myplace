{"title": "Regression-Free Synthesis for Concurrency.", "fields": ["counterexample", "program transformation", "concurrency", "thread", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "While fixing concurrency bugs, program repair algorithms may introduce new concurrency bugs. We present an algorithm that avoids such regressions. The solution space is given by a set of program transformations we consider in for repair process. These include reordering of instructions within a thread and inserting atomic sections. The new algorithm learns a constraint on the space of candidate solutions, from both positive examples (error-free traces) and counterexamples (error traces). From each counterexample, the algorithm learns a constraint necessary to remove the errors. From each positive examples, it learns a constraint that is necessary in order to prevent the repair from turning the trace into an error trace. We implemented the algorithm and evaluated it on simplified Linux device drivers with known bugs.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "University of Toronto", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Pavol Cern\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cern=yacute=:Pavol", "Thomas A.
