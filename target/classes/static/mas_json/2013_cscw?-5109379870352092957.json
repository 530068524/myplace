{"title": "Consequences of content diversity for online public spaces for local communities.", "fields": ["sustainability", "online participation", "computer science", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "While there is significant potential for social technologies to strengthen local communities, creating viable online spaces for them remains difficult. Maintaining a reliable content stream is challenging for local communities with their bounded emphases and limited population of potential contributors. Some systems focus on specific information types (e.g. restaurant, events). Others allow many different information types. This paper reports our findings about the consequences of content diversity from a study of neighborhood-oriented Facebook groups. The findings raise questions about the viability of designs for local online communities that focus narrowly on single topics, goals, and audiences.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Claudia A.
