{"title": "Oboe: auto-tuning video ABR algorithms to network conditions.", "fields": ["algorithm", "distributed computing", "reinforcement learning", "testbed", "oboe"], "abstract": "Most content providers are interested in providing good video delivery QoE for all users, not just on average. State-of-the-art ABR algorithms like BOLA and MPC rely on parameters that are sensitive to network conditions, so may perform poorly for some users and/or videos. In this paper, we propose a technique called Oboe to auto-tune these parameters to different network conditions. Oboe  pre-computes , for a given ABR algorithm, the best possible parameters for different network conditions, then  dynamically adapts  the parameters at run-time for the current network conditions. Using testbed experiments, we show that Oboe significantly improves BOLA, MPC, and a commercially deployed ABR. Oboe also betters a recently proposed reinforcement learning based ABR, Pensieve, by 24% on average on a composite QoE metric, in part because it is able to better specialize ABR behavior across different network states.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Purdue University", "University of Southern California", "Purdue University", "University of Windsor"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Zahaib Akhtar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akhtar:Zahaib", "Yun Seong Nam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nam:Yun_Seong", "Ramesh Govindan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Govindan:Ramesh", "Sanjay G.
