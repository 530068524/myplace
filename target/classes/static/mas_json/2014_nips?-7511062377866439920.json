{"title": "Unsupervised Transcription of Piano Music.", "fields": ["transcription", "piano", "source separation", "inference", "polyphony"], "abstract": "We present a new probabilistic model for transcribing piano music from audio to a symbolic form. Our model reflects the process by which discrete musical events give rise to acoustic signals that are then superimposed to produce the observed data. As a result, the inference procedure for our model naturally resolves the source separation problem introduced by the the piano's polyphony. In order to adapt to the properties of a new instrument or acoustic environment being transcribed, we learn recording-specific spectral profiles and temporal envelopes in an unsupervised fashion. Our system outperforms the best published approaches on a standard piano transcription task, achieving a 10.6% relative gain in note onset F1 on real piano audio.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berg=Kirkpatrick:Taylor", "Jacob Andreas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andreas:Jacob", "Dan Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Dan"], "pages": 9}
