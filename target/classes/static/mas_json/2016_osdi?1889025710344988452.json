{"title": "Unobservable Communication over Fully Untrusted Infrastructure.", "fields": ["conversation", "threat model", "private information retrieval", "unobservable", "metadata"], "abstract": "Keeping communication private has become increasingly important in an era of mass surveillance and state-sponsored attacks. While hiding the contents of a conversation has well-known solutions, hiding the associated metadata (participants, duration, etc.) remains a challenge, especially if one cannot trust ISPs or proxy servers. This paper describes a communication system called Pung that provably hides all content and metadata while withstanding global adversaries. Pung is a key-value store where clients deposit and retrieve messages without anyone-- including Pung's servers--learning of the existence of a conversation. Pung is based on private information retrieval, which we make more practical for our setting with new techniques. These include a private multiretrieval scheme, an application of the power of two choices, and batch codes. These extensions allow Pung to handle 103\u00d7 more users than prior systems with a similar threat model.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Sebastian Angel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angel:Sebastian", "Srinath T.
