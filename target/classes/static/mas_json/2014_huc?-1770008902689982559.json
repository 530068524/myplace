{"title": "Projective testing of diurnal collective emotion.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "human computer interaction", "projective test", "personality", "rorschach test"], "abstract": "Projective tests are personality tests that reveal individuals' emotions (e.g., Rorschach inkblot test). Unlike direct question-based tests, projective tests rely on ambiguous stimuli to evoke responses from individuals. In this paper we develop one such test, designed to be delivered automatically, anonymously and to a large community through public displays. Our work makes a number of contributions. First, we develop and validate in controlled conditions a quantitative projective test that can reveal emotions. Second, we demonstrate that this test can be deployed on a large scale longitudinally: we present a four-week deployment in our university's public spaces where 1431 tests were completed anonymously by passers-by. Third, our results reveal strong diurnal rhythms of emotion consistent with results we obtained independently using the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM), literature on affect, well-being, and our understanding of our university's daily routine.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "authors": ["Jorge Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves:Jorge", "Pratyush Pandab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandab:Pratyush", "Denzil Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Denzil", "Mohammad Ghahramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghahramani:Mohammad", "Guoying Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Guoying", "Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
