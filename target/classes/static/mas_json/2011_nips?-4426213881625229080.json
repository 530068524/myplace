However, most current approaches are slow to train, do not model the context of the word, and lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we present a new learning method, Low Rank Multi-View Learning (LR-MVL) which uses a fast spectral method to estimate low dimensional context-specific word representations from unlabeled data. These representation features can then be used with any supervised learner. LR-MVL is extremely fast, gives guaranteed convergence to a global optimum, is theoretically elegant, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on named entity recognition (NER) and chunking problems.", "citation": "Citations (184)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Paramveer S.
