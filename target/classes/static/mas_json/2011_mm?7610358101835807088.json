{"title": "Transforming clinical rehabilitation into interactive multimedia.", "fields": ["optical flow", "interactive media", "rehabilitation", "cognition", "psychosocial"], "abstract": "There has been an increased interest in using interactive multimedia as a mechanism for physical rehabilitation, including the direct usage of off-the-shelf games and gaming systems. Although, these games have been shown to have physical and psychosocial benefits in the elderly; they were limited when participants had significant physical and/or cognitive disabilities. The limited success in the use of gaming systems to promote rehabilitation may largely be due to the fact that the games being played on them were not designed with rehabilitation in mind and thus they do not necessarily target specific the symptoms or conditions of the disorder. However, if designed correctly and for rehabilitation, interactive multimedia and gaming systems have significant rehabilitation potential. We believe for a system to effective in promoting rehabilitation, its approach must be based in the clinical techniques used to treat the symptoms and the principles of neural science behind the disorder. In this paper, we describe and approach to Parkinson's rehabilitation using this methodology.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Catherine Vuong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vuong:Catherine", "Todd Ingalls.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ingalls:Todd", "James J.
