{"title": "Generalized Exponential Concentration Inequality for Renyi Divergence Estimation.", "fields": ["concentration inequality", "divergence", "estimator", "unit cube", "exponential function"], "abstract": "Estimating divergences in a consistent way is of great importance in many machine learning tasks. Although this is a fundamental problem in nonparametric statistics, to the best of our knowledge there has been no finite sample exponential inequality convergence bound derived for any divergence estimators. The main contribution of our work is to provide such a bound for an estimator of Renyi-\u03b1 divergence for a smooth Holder class of densities on the d-dimensional unit cube [0, 1]d. We also illustrate our theoretical results with a numerical experiment.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Shashank Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh_0005:Shashank", "Barnab\u00e1s P\u00f3czos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=oacute=czos:Barnab=aacute=s"], "pages": 9}
