{"title": "Are artificial team-mates scapegoats in computer games.", "fields": ["blame", "social psychology", "perception", "qualitative research", "psychology"], "abstract": "In cooperative games that involve team-mates that are controlled by either a computer or another human player, is there a difference in how humans assign credit or blame? There has been some related work on computers as team-mates and credit/blame assignment, but there does not seem to have been work to show whether the belief that a team-mate is human or not affects this. A qualitative study was conducted, in which 16 participants played variations of a team-based game with one of four kinds of team-mates: human (real or perceived) or AI (real or perceived). The two main findings of this research are that the perception of whether a team-mate is human or computer results in different credit/blame assignment and results in inaccurate skill assessment.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Tim Robert Merritt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Merritt:Tim_Robert", "Kian Boon Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian_Boon", "Christopher Ong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ong:Christopher", "Aswin Thomas Abraham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abraham:Aswin_Thomas", "Teong Leong Chuah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuah:Teong_Leong", "Kevin McGee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGee:Kevin"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
