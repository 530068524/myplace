{"title": "Architectural framework for supporting operating system survivability.", "fields": ["survivability", "overhead", "architecture framework", "software quality", "process management"], "abstract": "The ever increasing size and complexity of Operating System (OS) kernel code bring an inevitable increase in the number of security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. A successful security attack on the kernel has a profound impact that may affect all processes running on it. In this paper we propose an architectural framework that provides survivability to the OS kernel, i.e. able to keep normal system operation despite security faults. It consists of three components that work together: (1) security attack detection, (2) security fault isolation, and (3) a recovery mechanism that resumes normal system operation. Through simple but carefully-designed architecture support, we provide OS kernel survivability with low performance overheads (< 5% for kernel intensive benchmarks). When tested with real world security attacks, our survivability mechanism automatically prevents the security faults from corrupting the kernel state or affecting other processes, recovers the kernel state and resumes execution.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Xiaowei Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Xiaowei", "Yan Solihin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solihin:Yan"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
