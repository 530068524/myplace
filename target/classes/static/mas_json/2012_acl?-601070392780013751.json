{"title": "Historical Analysis of Legal Opinions with a Sparse Mixed-Effects Latent Variable Model.", "fields": ["legal opinion", "latent variable model", "discriminative model", "topic model", "property law"], "abstract": "We propose a latent variable model to enhance historical analysis of large corpora. This work extends prior work in topic modelling by incorporating metadata, and the interactions between the components in metadata, in a general way. To test this, we collect a corpus of slavery-related United States property law judgements sampled from the years 1730 to 1866. We study the language use in these legal cases, with a special focus on shifts in opinions on controversial topics across different regions. Because this is a longitudinal data set, we are also interested in understanding how these opinions change over the course of decades. We show that the joint learning scheme of our sparse mixed-effects model improves on other state-of-the-art generative and discriminative models on the region and time period identification tasks. Experiments show that our sparse mixed-effects model is more accurate quantitatively and qualitatively interesting, and that these improvements are robust across different parameter settings.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Columbia University", "American University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["William Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:William_Yang", "Elijah Mayfield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayfield:Elijah", "Suresh Naidu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naidu:Suresh", "Jeremiah Dittmar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dittmar:Jeremiah"], "pages": 10}
