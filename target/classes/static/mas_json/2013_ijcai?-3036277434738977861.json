However, dynamic situations arise in virtually all applications of these formalisms, which makes it necessary to study variants and extensions dealing with change. This paper presents a study on the computational complexity of qualitative change. More precisely, we discuss the reasoning task of finding a solution to a temporal sequence of static reasoning problems where this sequence is subject to additional transition constraints. Our focus is primarily on smoothness and continuity constraints: we show how such transitions can be defined as relations and expressed within qualitative constraint formalisms. Our results demonstrate that for point-based constraint formalisms the interesting fragments are NP-complete in the presence of continuity constraints, even if the satisfiability problem of its static descriptions is tractable.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Matthias Westphal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Westphal:Matthias", "Julien Hu\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu=eacute=:Julien", "Stefan W\u00f6lfl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/W=ouml=lfl_0001:Stefan", "Bernhard Nebel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nebel:Bernhard"], "pages": 7}
