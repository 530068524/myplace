In this work, we focus on the so-called extension enforcement problem in abstract argumentation. We provide a nearly complete computational complexity map of fixed-argument extension enforcement under various major AF semantics, with results ranging from polynomial-time algorithms to completeness for the second-level of the polynomial hierarchy. Complementing the complexity results, we propose algorithms for NP-hard extension enforcement based on constrained optimization. Going beyond NP, we propose novel counterexample-guided abstraction refinement procedures for the second-level complete problems and present empirical results on a prototype system constituting the first approach to extension enforcement in its generality.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"], "authors": ["Johannes Peter Wallner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wallner:Johannes_Peter", "Andreas Niskanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niskanen:Andreas", "Matti J\u00e4rvisalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=auml=rvisalo:Matti"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
