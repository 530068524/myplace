{"title": "\"This is how we do it in my country\": a study of computer-mediated family communication among kenyan migrants in the united states.", "fields": ["kenya", "identity management", "computer supported cooperative work", "homeland", "social connectedness"], "abstract": "Although computer-mediated family communication remains a longstanding focus of study in Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), families who face challenges in communication due to differences in technology infrastructures remain understudied. To address this gap in the literature, we interviewed 39 Kenyan migrants living in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. who regularly communicate with friends and family members living in their homeland. The contributions of this work are primarily empirical. Findings from our study reveal how high costs, identity management, and infrastructural differences between rural and urban areas in Kenya, impact decisions families and their extended members make when using information and communication technology (ICT). We present design implications and reflect on how understanding Kenyan migrants' ICT practices can positively influence design for the broader population.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Susan Wyche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wyche:Susan", "Rebecca E.
