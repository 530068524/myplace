{"title": "Scalable reduction collectives with data partitioning-based multi-leader design.", "fields": ["xeon", "throughput", "scalability", "infiniband", "parallel computing"], "abstract": "Existing designs for MPI_Allreduce do not take advantage of the vast parallelism available in modern multi-/many-core processors like Intel Xeon/Xeon Phis or the increases in communication throughput and recent advances in high-end features seen with modern interconnects like InfiniBand and Omni-Path. In this paper, we propose a high-performance and scalable  D ata  P artitioning-based  M ulti- L eader (DPML) solution for MPI_Allreduce that can take advantage of the parallelism offered by multi-/many-core architectures in conjunction with the high throughput and high-end features offered by InfiniBand and Omni-Path to significantly enhance the performance of MPI_Allreduce on modern HPC systems. We also model  DPML -based designs to analyze the communication costs theoretically. Microbenchmark level evaluations show that the proposed  DPML -based designs are able to deliver up to 3.5 times performance improvement for MPI_Allreduce for multiple HPC systems at scale. At the application-level, up to 35% and 60% improvement is seen in communication for HPCG and miniAMR respectively.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Mohammadreza Bayatpour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bayatpour:Mohammadreza", "Sourav Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty_0003:Sourav", "Hari Subramoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramoni:Hari", "Xiaoyi Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Xiaoyi", "Dhabaleswar K.
