Our method encompasses three tasks that have been previously handled separately: input segmentation, phoneme prediction, and sequence modeling. The key idea is online discriminative training, which updates parameters according to a comparison of the current system output to the desired output, allowing us to train all of our components together. By folding the three steps of a pipeline approach into a unified dynamic programming framework, we are able to achieve substantial performance gains. Our results surpass the current state-of-the-art on six publicly available data sets representing four different languages.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sittichai Jiampojamarn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiampojamarn:Sittichai", "Colin Cherry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cherry:Colin", "Grzegorz Kondrak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kondrak:Grzegorz"], "pages": 9}
