We apply this approach to the real-world problem of learning models for the driving behavior of truck drivers. We discretize the values of onboard sensors into simple events. Instead of the common syntactic pattern recognition approach of sampling the signal values at a fixed rate, we model the time constraints using timed models. We learn these models using the RTI+ algorithm from grammatical inference, and show how to use computational mechanics and a form of semi-supervised classification to construct a real-time automaton classifier for driving behavior. Promising results are shown using this new approach.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Sicco Verwer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verwer:Sicco", "Mathijs de Weerdt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weerdt:Mathijs_de", "Cees Witteveen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Witteveen:Cees"], "pages": 6}
