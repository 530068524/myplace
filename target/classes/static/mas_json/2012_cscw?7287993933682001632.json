{"title": "Coordination and beyond: social functions of groups in open content production.", "fields": ["qualitative property", "peer production", "open content", "organizational structure", "socialization"], "abstract": "We report on a study of the English edition of Wikipedia in which we used a mixed methods approach to understand how nested organizational structures called WikiProjects support collaboration. We first conducted two rounds of interviews with a total of 20 Wikipedians to understand how WikiProjects function and what it's like to participate in them from the perspective of Wikipedia editors. We then used a quantitative approach to further explore interpretations that arose from the qualitative data. Our analysis of these data together demonstrates how WikiProjects not only help Wikipedians coordinate tasks and produce articles, but also support community members and small groups of editors in important ways such as: providing a place to find collaborators, socialize and network; protecting editors' work; and structuring opportunities to contribute.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Playdom, Palo A ...
