As a consequence, they commonly have to coordinate with other systems via complex message communication while realizing safety-critical and real-time tasks. As a result, those systems should be correct by construction. Software architects can achieve this by using the MechatronicUML process and language. This paper presents the MechatronicUML Tool Suite that offers unique features to support the MechatronicUML modeling and analyses tasks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Paderborn", "University of Paderborn", "University of Paderborn", "University of Paderborn", "Fraunhofer Society"], "authors": ["Stefan Dziwok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dziwok:Stefan", "Christopher Gerking.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerking:Christopher", "Steffen Becker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Becker:Steffen", "Sebastian Thiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thiele:Sebastian", "Christian Heinzemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinzemann:Christian", "Uwe Pohlmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pohlmann:Uwe"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
