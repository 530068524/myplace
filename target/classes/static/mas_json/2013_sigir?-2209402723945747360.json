{"title": "Modeling user's receptiveness over time for recommendation.", "fields": ["gibbs sampling", "probabilistic logic", "generative model", "collaborative filtering", "personalization"], "abstract": "Existing recommender systems model user interests and the social influences independently. In reality, user interests may change over time, and as the interests change, new friends may be added while old friends grow apart and the new friendships formed may cause further interests change. This complex interaction requires the joint modeling of user interest and social relationships over time. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model, called Receptiveness over Time Model (RTM), to capture this interaction. We design a Gibbs sampling algorithm to learn the receptiveness and interest distributions among users over time. The results of experiments on a real world dataset demonstrate that RTM-based recommendation outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Case studies also show that RTM is able to discover the user interest shift and receptiveness change over time", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Wei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0025:Wei", "Wynne Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Wynne", "Mong-Li Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Mong=Li"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
