This higher-level abstraction improves generalization in different prediction settings, but computing predictions often becomes intractable in large decision spaces. We propose the Softstar algorithm, a softened heuristic-guided search technique for the maximum entropy inverse optimal control model of sequential behavior. This approach supports probabilistic search with bounded approximation error at a significantly reduced computational cost when compared to sampling based methods. We present the algorithm, analyze approximation guarantees, and compare performance with simulation-based inference on two distinct complex decision tasks.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "New York University", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "Disney Research", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Mathew Monfort.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monfort:Mathew", "Brenden M.
