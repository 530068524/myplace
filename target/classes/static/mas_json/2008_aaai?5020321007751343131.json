{"title": "The Parameterized Complexity of Global Constraints.", "fields": ["local consistency", "bounded function", "constraint programming", "constraint logic programming", "parameterized complexity"], "abstract": "We argue that parameterized complexity is a useful tool with which to study global constraints. In particular, we show that many global constraints which are intractable to propagate completely have natural parameters which make them fixed-parameter tractable and which are easy to compute. This tractability tends either to be the result of a simple dynamic program or of a decomposition which has a strong backdoor of bounded size. This strong backdoor is often a cycle cutset. We also show that parameterized complexity can be used to study other aspects of constraint programming like symmetry breaking. For instance, we prove that value symmetry is fixed-parameter tractable to break in the number of symmetries. Finally, we argue that parameterized complexity can be used to derive results about the approximability of constraint propagation.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al", "LIRMM, Montpellier, France", "UCC, Ireland", "Izmir Uni. of E ...
