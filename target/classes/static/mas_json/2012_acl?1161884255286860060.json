{"title": "Structuring E-Commerce Inventory.", "fields": ["structuring", "principle of maximum entropy", "e commerce", "synonym", "recall"], "abstract": "Large e-commerce enterprises feature millions of items entered daily by a large variety of sellers. While some sellers provide rich, structured descriptions of their items, a vast majority of them provide unstructured natural language descriptions. In the paper we present a 2 steps method for structuring items into descriptive properties. The first step consists in unsupervised property discovery and extraction. The second step involves supervised property synonym discovery using a maximum entropy based clustering algorithm. We evaluate our method on a year worth of e-commerce data and show that it achieves excellent precision with good recall.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["eBay", "eBay", "eBay"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Karin Mauge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mauge:Karin", "Khash Rohanimanesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rohanimanesh:Khash", "Jean-David Ruvini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruvini:Jean=David"], "pages": 10}
