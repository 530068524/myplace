In this paper, we propose a novel method to recover a sharp image from a pair of motion blurred and flash images, consecutively captured using a hand-held camera. We first introduce a robust flash gradient constraint by exploiting the correlation between a sharp image and its corresponding flash image. Then we formulate our flash deblurring as solving a maximum-a-posteriori problem under the flash gradient constraint. We solve the problem by performing kernel estimation and non-blind deconvolution iteratively, leading to an accurate blur kernel and a reconstructed image with fine image details. Experiments on both synthetic and real images show the superiority of our method compared with existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shaojie Zhuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuo:Shaojie", "Dong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo_0001:Dong", "Terence Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Terence"], "pages": 8}
