{"title": "Connecting in the Kitchen: An Empirical Study of Physical Interactions while Cooking Together at Home.", "fields": ["interaction design", "spatial organization", "proxemics", "empirical research", "sustenance"], "abstract": "Recent research has explored the role technology might play in future kitchens, including virtually dining together, recipe sharing, augmented kitchen furniture, reactive cooking utensils and gestural interaction. When people come together in a kitchen to cook it is about more than just production of sustenance -- it is about being together, helping each other, exchanging stories, and contributing to the gradual emergence of a shared meal. In this paper we present a digital ethnography of how people coordinate and cooperate in their kitchens when cooking together for the purpose of inspiring the design of social natural user interactions for technologies in the kitchen. The study is based on 61 YouTube videos of people cooking together analyzed using the frameworks of proxemics and F-formations. Our findings unfold and illustrate relationships between people's spatial organization, their cooking activities and physical kitchen layouts. Based on these we discuss the kitchen as a design space and particularly the opportunities for social natural user interaction design.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University"], "authors": ["Jeni Paay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paay:Jeni", "Jesper Kjeldskov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kjeldskov:Jesper", "Mikael B.
