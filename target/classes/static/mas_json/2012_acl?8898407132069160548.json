These questions test the ability of algorithms to distinguish sense from nonsense based on a variety of sentence-level phenomena. We tackle the problem with two approaches: methods that use local lexical information, such as the n-grams of a classical language model; and methods that evaluate global coherence, such as latent semantic analysis. We evaluate these methods on a suite of practice SAT questions, and on a recently released sentence completion task based on data taken from five Conan Doyle novels. We find that by fusing local and global information, we can exceed 50% on this task (chance baseline is 20%), and we suggest some avenues for further research.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Cornell University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Geoffrey Zweig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zweig:Geoffrey", "John C.
