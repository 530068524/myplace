In online webcast lectures, however, interaction can be difficult because instructors lack basic awareness information about their remote students. Our goal is to better understand the kinds of awareness information that instructors should have if they are to interact frequently and effectively with their students in e-learning environments. We conducted an exploratory study -- via interviews and observations -- of instructor attention in face-to-face classrooms at a large university. Our results imply that a webcast system should provide instructors with overview and detailed data about their students, but that this detailed information should not be displayed publicly.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Cornell University", "University of Toronto", "University of Calgary", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jeremy P.
