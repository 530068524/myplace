Moreover, such bugs are hard to detect using existing bug-finding tools without correct error specifications. Creating error specifications manually is tedious and error-prone. In this paper, we present a new technique that automatically infers error specifications of API functions based on their usage patterns in C programs. Our key insight is that error-handling code tend to have fewer branching points and program statements than the code implementing regular functionality. Our scheme leverages this property to automatically identify error handling code at API call sites and infer the corresponding error constraints. We then use the error constraints from multiple call sites for robust inference of API error specifications. We evaluated our technique on 217 API functions from 6 different libraries across 28 projects written in C and found that it can identify error-handling paths with an average precision of 94% and recall of 66%. We also found that our technique can infer correct API error specifications with an average precision of 77% and recall of 47%. To further demonstrate the usefulness of the inferred error specifications, we used them to find 118 previously unknown potential bugs (including several security flaws that are currently being fixed by the corresponding developers) in the 28 tested projects.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "University of Virginia", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Yuan Jochen Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Yuan_Jochen", "Baishakhi Ray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ray:Baishakhi", "Suman Jana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jana:Suman"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2016", "pages": 11}
