The energy of each sensor is limited which limits network lifetime. There are many existing energy efficiency algorithms to prolong network lifetime. Basically, there are two kinds of methods. One is energy-efficiency management, such as duty-cycling using virtual-backbones. The other one is energy provision, such as energy harvest from the environment. In this paper, we introduce a new problem, CDSEH, to combine these two methods together. We also propose a new standard to define the network lifetime of a WSN. We prove that the CDSEH problem is NP-Complete and propose two approximate algorithms accordingly. Extensive simulation results are shown to validate the performance of our algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Georgia State University", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Tuo Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Tuo", "Siyao Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Siyao", "Zhipeng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Zhipeng", "Jianzhong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianzhong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
