{"title": "Regularizers versus Losses for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction: A Factored View with New Convex Relaxations.", "fields": ["regular polygon", "singular value", "maximization", "nonlinear dimensionality reduction", "truncation"], "abstract": "We demonstrate that almost all non-parametric dimensionality reduction methods can be expressed by a simple procedure: regularized loss minimization plus singular value truncation. By distinguishing the role of the loss and regularizer in such a process, we recover a factored perspective that reveals some gaps in the current literature. Beyond identifying a useful new loss for manifold unfolding, a key contribution is to derive new convex regularizers that combine distance maximization with rank reduction. These regularizers can be applied to any loss.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["James Neufeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neufeld:James", "Yaoliang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yaoliang", "Xinhua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xinhua", "Ryan Kiros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiros:Ryan", "Dale Schuurmans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuurmans:Dale"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
