The Stochastic Block-Model (SBM) is a generative model for graphs with \"communities\" for which, because of its simplicity, the theoretical understanding has advanced fast in recent years. In particular, there have been various results showing that simple versions of spectral clustering using the Normalized Laplacian of the graph can recover the communities almost perfectly with high probability. Here we show that essentially the same algorithm used for the SBM and for its extension called Degree-Corrected SBM, works on a wider class of Block-Models, which we call Preference Frame Models, with essentially the same guarantees. Moreover, the parametrization we introduce clearly exhibits the free parameters needed to specify this class of models, and results in bounds that expose with more clarity the parameters that control the recovery error in this model class.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yali Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Yali", "Marina Meila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meila:Marina"], "pages": 9}
