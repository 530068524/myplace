This means that usually there is not one optimal design but an entire set of Pareto-optimal ones with optimal tradeoffs in the objectives. In many applications, evaluating one design is expensive; thus, an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is unfeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the Pareto Active Learning (PAL) algorithm which intelligently samples the design space to predict the Pareto-optimal set. Key features of PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as samples from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accomodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on PAL's sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we show an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets. The results show PAL's effectiveness; in particular it improves significantly over a state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization method, saving in many cases about 33% evaluations to achieve the same accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Marcela Zuluaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuluaga:Marcela", "Guillaume Sergent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sergent:Guillaume", "Andreas Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause_0001:Andreas", "Markus P\u00fcschel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=uuml=schel:Markus"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
