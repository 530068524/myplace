{"title": "Group hedonic balance and pair programming performance: affective interaction dynamics as indicators of performance.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "affect", "pair programming", "computer science", "thin slicing"], "abstract": "Inspired by research on the role of affect in marital interactions, the authors examined whether affective interaction dynamics occurring within a 5-minute slice can predict pair programming performance. In a laboratory experiment with professional programmers, Group Hedonic Balance, a measure of the balance between positive and negative expressed affect, accounted for up to 35% of the variance in not only subjective but also objective pair programming performance. Implications include a new set of methods to study pair programming interactions and recommendations to improve pair programming performance.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "OnLive, Palo Al ... , United States"], "authors": ["Malte Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Malte", "Jan Chong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chong:Jan", "Larry J.
