We conducted an ethnographic study of the CIS practices of healthcare providers in a hospital emergency department to gain a conceptual understanding of when and how collaborative sensemaking occurs during CIS activities. We present occasions and characteristics of collaborative sensemaking and design implications for collaborative information retrieval tools to support sensemaking.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Sharoda A.
