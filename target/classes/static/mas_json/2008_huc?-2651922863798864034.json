This paper argues that context-awareness can be used for safety-critical systems too. But since the consequences of errors or failures in safety-critical systems are potentially severe, we should have a high degree of confidence in these systems. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a context-aware patient safety and information system (CAPSIS) designed for use during surgery. Specifically, our study indicates that CAPSIS could improve patient safety in the operating room. More generally, the paper suggests that context-aware technologies offer a promising step forward in the design of safety-critical systems.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["IT University of Copenhagen", "IT University of Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Jakob E.
