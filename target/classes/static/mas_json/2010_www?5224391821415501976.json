{"title": "eduKEN: a tool for fine-grained video comment collection and analysis.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "interface design", "user interface", "user interface design", "search engine"], "abstract": "An increasing amount of Web information is in video format. Today's search technology allows videos to be found using graphical features and textual descriptions. However, the information gleaned from video features is coarse, while textual descriptions are often short and fail to capture the precise content of videos. We hypothesize that user comments contain supplemental information that effectively describes the content of a video. This information, once extracted, can be applied to a search engine index to improve video search accuracy.   A complete comment-based indexing system must encourage users to post comments and be able to analyze comment data. To support research in the relevant areas of interface design, text analysis, and information retrieval, we present eduKEN, a flexible Web-based tool that allows comment collection, analysis, and search. To support the collection of real-world comment data in an educational setting, eduKEN includes an additional user interface designed for classroom use.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Georgetown University", "TOCA, LLC, Chicago, IL, USA"], "authors": ["Wai Gen Yee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yee:Wai_Gen", "Andrew Yates.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yates:Andrew", "Ophir Frieder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frieder:Ophir", "Armin Moehrle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moehrle:Armin"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
