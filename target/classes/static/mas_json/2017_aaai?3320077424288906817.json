In this paper, we propose a deep neural networks (DNN) based PBE model called Neural Programming by Example (NPBE), which can learn from input-output strings and induce programs that solve the string manipulation problems. Our NPBE model has four neural network based components: a string encoder, an input-output analyzer, a program generator, and a symbol selector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NPBE by training it end-to-end to solve some common string manipulation problems in spreadsheet systems. The results show that our model can induce string manipulation programs effectively. Our work is one step towards teaching DNN to generate computer programs.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Newcastle"], "authors": ["Chengxun Shu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shu:Chengxun", "Hongyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hongyu"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
