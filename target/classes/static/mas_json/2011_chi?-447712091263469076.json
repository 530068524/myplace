{"title": "How users associate wireless devices.", "fields": ["wireless", "human computer interaction", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "In a wireless world, users can establish connections between devices spontaneously, and unhampered by cables. However, in the absence of cables, what is the natural interaction to connect one device with another? A wide range of device association techniques have been demonstrated, but it has remained an open question what actions users would spontaneously choose for device association. We contribute a study eliciting device association actions from non-technical users without premeditation. Over 700 user-defined actions were collected for 37 different device combinations. We present a classification of user-defined actions, and observations of the users' rationale. Our findings indicate that there is no single most spontaneous action; instead five prominent categories of user-defined actions were found.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ming Ki Chong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chong:Ming_Ki", "Hans Gellersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gellersen:Hans"], "pages": 10}
