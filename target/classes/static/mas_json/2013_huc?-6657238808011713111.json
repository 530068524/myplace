We take smartphone audio inference a step further and demonstrate for the first time that it's possible to accurately estimate the number of people talking in a certain place -- with an average error distance of 1.5 speakers -- through unsupervised machine learning analysis on audio segments captured by the smartphones. Inference occurs transparently to the user and no human intervention is needed to derive the classification model. Our results are based on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system called Crowd++, involving 120 participants in 10 very different environments. We show that no dedicated external hardware or cumbersome supervised learning approaches are needed but only off-the-shelf smartphones used in a transparent manner. We believe our findings have profound implications in many research fields, including social sensing and personal wellbeing assessment.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Rutgers University", "AT&T Labs"], "authors": ["Chenren Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Chenren", "Sugang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Sugang", "Gang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Gang", "Yanyong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanyong", "Emiliano Miluzzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miluzzo:Emiliano", "Yih-Farn Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yih=Farn", "Jun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jun", "Bernhard Firner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Firner:Bernhard"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
