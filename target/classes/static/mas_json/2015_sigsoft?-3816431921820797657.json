This paper presents JSketch, a tool that brings sketch-based synthesis to Java. JSketch's input is a partial Java program that may include holes, which are unknown constants, expression generators, which range over sets of expressions, and class generators, which are partial classes. JSketch then translates the synthesis problem into a Sketch problem; this translation is complex because Sketch is not object-oriented. Finally, JSketch synthesizes an executable Java program by interpreting the output of Sketch.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jinseong Jeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeon:Jinseong", "Xiaokang Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Xiaokang", "Jeffrey S.
