However, there have been few efforts on understanding the correlations between users' social media profiles and their e-commerce behaviors. This paper presents a system for predicting a user's purchase behaviors on e-commerce websites from the user's social media profile. We specifically aim at understanding if the user's profile information in a social network (for example Facebook) can be leveraged to predict what categories of products the user will buy from (for example eBay Electronics). The paper provides an extensive analysis on how users' Facebook profile information correlates to purchases on eBay, and analyzes the performance of different feature sets and learning algorithms on the task of purchase behavior prediction.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "departments": ["eBay", "eBay"], "authors": ["Yongzheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yongzheng", "Marco Pennacchiotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pennacchiotti:Marco"], "conf": "www", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
