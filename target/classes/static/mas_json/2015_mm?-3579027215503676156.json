{"title": "Drag A Star: The Social Media in Outer Space.", "fields": ["outer space", "wish", "display device", "immersion", "social media"], "abstract": "\"Drag A Star\" is an interactive installation artwork that gives audiences an immersive and stunning interactive experience to remember the myth of making wishes upon a shooting star. Through the interactions with the display, audiences can learn about meteorites from outer space based on scientific and artistic perspectives by catching a shooting star with their smartphones. Audiences can send their wishes to a shooting star through their smartphones, while being able to read and reply the wishes from others at the same time. The piece was created based on the latest technologies of digital display, screen smart-device interactions, mobile applications, and web-based messaging systems. Extensive scientific, artistic and design efforts were integrated to create these cyber-physical interactive experiences between shooting stars and audiences. The artistic statement of this installation, akin to many ancient myths about wishing upon shooting stars, is about the possibility of catching a shooting star physically through technologies, and realizing someone's wish after reading them. Hence the existence of shooting stars could likely be the social media in outer space - a world where a connection is made between other beings in the Universe.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "JM Network, Hon ...
