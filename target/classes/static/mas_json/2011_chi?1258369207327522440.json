Unlike prior research, which focuses on personal sensing, we present low-cost, networked air quality sensors, designed to be repositioned across public landscapes by communities of citizen stakeholders. Our GPS-enabled sensors report dust, exhaust, or VOC's (volatile organic compounds), along with temperature, humidity and light levels to a website that visualizes this data in real time. The sensors can be attached to a variety of surfaces serving as research probes to demarcate ('tag') public spaces with environmental concerns. We deploy our fully functional system with four urban communities - parents, bicyclists, homeless and activists, positioning our system as a tool for studying and supporting community togetherness and public activism. Our findings highlight community sharing of the physical sensors and dialogues surrounding the collected data.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Stacey Kuznetsov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuznetsov:Stacey", "George Noel Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:George_Noel", "Jian Chiu Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Jian_Chiu", "Eric Paulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paulos:Eric"], "pages": 10}
