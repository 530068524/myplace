{"title": "On the costs of multiple trajectory pointing methods.", "fields": ["trajectory", "pointer", "computer science", "simulation"], "abstract": "Several enhanced pointing techniques aim to reduce the Fitts' law targeting distance by providing multiple target trajectories in the hope that a shorter path is available. However, these techniques introduce a search or decision component to pointing users must examine the alternatives available and decide upon the trajectory to use. We analyse these difficulties, present a methodology for examining them as well as other behaviour issues, and report empirical results of performance with pointer wrapping and Ninja cursors. Results show that offering multiple trajectories incurs a significant search or decision cost, and that users are therefore poor at capitalising on the theoretical benefits of reduced target distance.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Canterbury", "University of Canterbury", "University of Tampere", "Polytech Paris- ... , Paris, France"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Philip Quinn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quinn:Philip", "Andy Cockburn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cockburn:Andy", "Kari-Jouko R\u00e4ih\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=ih=auml=:Kari=Jouko", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delamarche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delamarche:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me"], "pages": 4}
