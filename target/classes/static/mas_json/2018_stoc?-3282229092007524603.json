{"title": "(Gap/S)ETH hardness of SVP.", "fields": ["lattice problem", "exponential time hypothesis", "mathematical analysis", "norm", "combinatorics"], "abstract": "We prove the following quantitative hardness results for the Shortest Vector Problem in the l  p   norm (SVP_p), where  n  is the rank of the input lattice.    For \u201calmost all\u201d  p  >  p  0  \u2248 2.1397, there is no 2  n / C   p   -time algorithm for SVP_p for some explicit (easily computable) constant  C   p   > 0 unless the (randomized) Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false. (E.g., for  p  \u2265 3,  C   p    p +3) 2 \u2212 p   + 10  p  2  2 \u22122 p  .)    For any 1 \u2264  p  \u2264 \u221e, there is no 2  o ( n ) -time algorithm for SVP_p unless the non-uniform Gap-Exponential Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH) is false. Furthermore, for each such  p , there exists a constant \u03b3  p   > 1 such that the same result holds even for \u03b3  p  -approximate SVP_p.    For  p  > 2, the above statement holds under the weaker assumption of randomized Gap-ETH. I.e., there is no 2  o ( n ) -time algorithm for \u03b3  p  -approximate SVP_p unless randomized Gap-ETH is false.
