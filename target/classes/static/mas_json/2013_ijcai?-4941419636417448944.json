We propose Multimodal Multi-instance Multi-label Latent Dirichlet Allocation (M3LDA), where the model consists of a visual-label part, a textual-label part and a label-topic part. The basic idea is that the topic decided by the visual information and the topic decided by the textual information should be consistent, leading to the correct label assignment. Particularly, M3LDA is able to annotate image regions, thus provides a promising way to understand the relation between input patterns and output semantics. Experiments on Corel5K and ImageCLEF validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Cam-Tu Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Cam=Tu", "De-Chuan Zhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhan:De=Chuan", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "pages": 7}
