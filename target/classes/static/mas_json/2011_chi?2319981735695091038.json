In this paper we describe our method of charting and creating comparable designs, and present a survey-based study of 106 social media users on their preferences regarding location indicators. Our paper contributes in proposing a methodology for visual element evaluation purposes, and reveals results, e.g., that users preferred simple indicators such as points or pins for their own location, and friend location indicators to include the corresponding name.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Intel", "Nokia", "Nokia"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Minna Pakanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pakanen:Minna", "Jussi Huhtala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huhtala:Jussi", "Jonna H\u00e4kkil\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=kkil=auml=:Jonna"], "pages": 10}
