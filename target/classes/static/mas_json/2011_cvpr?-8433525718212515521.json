Our goal is to compute camera paths that are composed of constant, linear and parabolic segments mimicking the camera motions employed by professional cinematographers. To this end, our algorithm is based on a linear programming framework to minimize the first, second, and third derivatives of the resulting camera path. Our method allows for video stabilization beyond the conventional filtering of camera paths that only suppresses high frequency jitter. We incorporate additional constraints on the path of the camera directly in our algorithm, allowing for stabilized and retargeted videos. Our approach accomplishes this without the need of user interaction or costly 3D reconstruction of the scene, and works as a post-process for videos from any camera or from an online source.", "citation": "Citations (253)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Matthias Grundmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grundmann:Matthias", "Vivek Kwatra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwatra:Vivek", "Irfan A.
