In this paper we study how close, in additive error, can approximately modular functions be to truly modular functions. We first obtain a polynomial time algorithm that makes O(n2 log n) queries to any approximately modular function to reconstruct a modular function that is O(a#x221A;n)-close. We also show an almost matching lower bound: any algorithm world need super polynomially many queries to construct a modular function that is O(a#x221A;n/log n)-close. In a striking contrast to these near-tight computational reconstruction bounds, we then show that for any approximately modular function, there exists a modular function that is O(log n)-close.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Microsoft", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Flavio Chierichetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chierichetti:Flavio", "Abhimanyu Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Abhimanyu", "Anirban Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta_0001:Anirban", "Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Ravi"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
