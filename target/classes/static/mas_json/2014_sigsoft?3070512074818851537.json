{"title": "ConceptCloud: a tagcloud browser for software archives.", "fields": ["world wide web", "tag cloud", "novelty", "formal concept analysis", "software"], "abstract": "ConceptCloud is an interactive browser for SVN and Git repositories. Its main novelty is the combination of an intuitive tag cloud interface with an underlying concept lattice that provides a formal structure for navigation. This combination allows users to explore repositories serendipitously, without predefined search goals and along different navigation paths. ConceptCloud can derive different lattice types for a repository and supports concurrent navigation in multiple linked tag clouds that can each be individually customized, which allows multi-faceted repository explorations.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Stellenbosch University", "Stellenbosch University"], "authors": ["Gillian J.
