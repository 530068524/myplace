The induction step and the disambiguation step are based on the same principle: words and contexts are mapped to a limited number of topical dimensions in a latent semantic word space. The intuition is that a particular sense is associated with a particular topic, so that different senses can be discriminated through their association with particular topical dimensions; in a similar vein, a particular instance of a word can be disambiguated by determining its most important topical dimensions. The model is evaluated on the semeval-2010 word sense induction and disambiguation task, on which it reaches state-of-the-art results.", "citation": "Citations (40)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Sorbonne"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Tim Van de Cruys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cruys:Tim_Van_de", "Marianna Apidianaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apidianaki:Marianna"], "pages": 10}
