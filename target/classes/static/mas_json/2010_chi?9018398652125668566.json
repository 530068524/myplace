In particular, when experts perceive novices as a bother or a threat, the experts may express territoriality: behaviors communicating ownership of a target of interest. In this paper, we describe the results of a user study of a mobile social tagging system deployed within a museum gallery to a group of novices and experts collaboratively tagging part of the collection. We observed that experts express greater feelings of ownership towards their contributions to the system and the museum in general. Experts were more likely than novices to participate at higher rates and to negatively evaluate contributions made by others. We suggest a number of design strategies to balance experts' expressions of territoriality so as to motivate their participation while discouraging exclusionary behaviors.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["IBM", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Jennifer Thom-Santelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thom=Santelli:Jennifer", "Dan Cosley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cosley:Dan", "Geri Gay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gay:Geri"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
