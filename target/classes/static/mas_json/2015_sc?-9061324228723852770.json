However, analyzing the huge amount of output from these simulations remains a challenge. Most analyses of this output is performed in post-processing mode at the end of the simulation. The time to read the output for the analysis can be significantly high due to poor I/O bandwidth, which increases the end-to-end simulation-analysis time. Simulation-time analysis can reduce this end-to-end time. In this work, we present the scheduling of in-situ analysis as a numerical optimization problem to maximize the number of online analyses subject to resource constraints such as I/O bandwidth, network bandwidth, rate of computation and available memory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two application case studies on the IBM Blue Gene/Q system.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Preeti Malakar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malakar:Preeti", "Venkatram Vishwanath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vishwanath:Venkatram", "Todd Munson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munson:Todd", "Christopher Knight.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knight:Christopher", "Mark Hereld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hereld:Mark", "Sven Leyffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leyffer:Sven", "Michael E.
