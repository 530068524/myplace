In various applications, graphs are enriched by additional information. For example, we can observe graphs representing different types of relations between the vertices. These multiple edge types can also be viewed as different \"layers\" of the same graph, which is denoted as a \"multi-layer graph\" in this work. Additionally, each edge might be annotated by a label characterizing the given relation in more detail. By exploiting all these different kinds of information, the detection of more interesting clusters in the graph can be supported.   In this work, we introduce the multi-layer coherent subgraph (MLCS) model, which defines clusters of vertices that are densely connected by edges with similar labels in a subset of the graph layers. We avoid redundancy in the result by selecting only the most interesting, non-redundant clusters for the output. Based on this model, we introduce the best-first search algorithm MiMAG. In thorough experiments we demonstrate the strengths of MiMAG in comparison with related approaches on synthetic as well as real-world datasets.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Brigitte Boden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boden:Brigitte", "Stephan G\u00fcnnemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=uuml=nnemann:Stephan", "Holger Hoffmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoffmann:Holger", "Thomas Seidl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidl_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
