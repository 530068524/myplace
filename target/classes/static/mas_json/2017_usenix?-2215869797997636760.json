{"title": "Execution Templates: Caching Control Plane Decisions for Strong Scaling of Data Analytics.", "fields": ["cache", "nested loop join", "repetitive control", "template", "granularity"], "abstract": "Control planes of cloud frameworks trade off between scheduling granularity and performance. Centralized systems schedule at task granularity, but only schedule a few thousand tasks per second. Distributed systems schedule hundreds of thousands of tasks per second but changing the schedule is costly. \nWe present execution templates, a control plane abstraction that can schedule hundreds of thousands of tasks per second while supporting fine-grained, per-task scheduling decisions. Execution templates leverage a program's repetitive control flow to cache blocks of frequently-executed tasks. Executing a task in a template requires sending a single message. Large-scale scheduling changes install new templates, while small changes apply edits to existing templates. \nEvaluations of execution templates in Nimbus, a data analytics framework, find that they provide the fine-grained scheduling flexibility of centralized control planes while matching the strong scaling of distributed ones. Execution templates support complex, real-world applications, such as a fluid simulation with a triply nested loop and data dependent branches.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Omid Mashayekhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mashayekhi:Omid", "Hang Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Hang", "Chinmayee Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Chinmayee", "Philip Levis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levis:Philip"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
