{"title": "The Total Variation on Hypergraphs - Learning on Hypergraphs Revisited.", "fields": ["graph", "regularization", "hypergraph", "constraint graph", "tensor"], "abstract": "Hypergraphs allow one to encode higher-order relationships in data and are thus a very flexible modeling tool. Current learning methods are either based on approximations of the hypergraphs via graphs or on tensor methods which are only applicable under special conditions. In this paper, we present a new learning framework on hypergraphs which fully uses the hypergraph structure. The key element is a family of regularization functionals based on the total variation on hypergraphs.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "authors": ["Matthias Hein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hein_0001:Matthias", "Simon Setzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Setzer:Simon", "Leonardo Jost.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jost:Leonardo", "Syama Sundar Rangapuram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangapuram:Syama_Sundar"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
