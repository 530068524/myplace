The key contribution is the establishment of three criteria to expand a node in TD network: a node is expanded when the node is well-known, independent, and has a prediction error that requires further explanation. Since none of these criteria requires centralized calculation operations, they are easily computed in a parallel and distributed manner, and scalable for bigger problems compared to other discovery methods of predictive state representations. Through computer experiments, we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Research Organi ... s, Tokyo, Japan"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Takaki Makino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makino:Takaki", "Toshihisa Takagi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takagi:Toshihisa"], "pages": 8}
