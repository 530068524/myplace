Given a homogeneous set of sensors with unit lifetime and a set of target points, find an active/sleeping schedule for sensors to maximize the lifetime of k-coverage, i.e., the time period during which every target point is covered by at least k active sensors. This is a well known problem in wireless sensor networks concerning with energy efficiency. When k = 1, it is called the maximum lifetime coverage problem which has been proved to have a polynomial-time (4 + e)-approximation. When k \u2265 2, it is the maximum lifetime fault-tolerant coverage problem. Previous to this work, only in the case k = 2, a polynomial-time (6 + e)-approximation is found. In this paper, we will make a significant progress by showing that for any positive integer k, there exists a polynomial-time (4 + e)-approximation, and for k = 1,2, the performance ratio can be improved to (3 + e).", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "Zhejiang Normal University", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["James Willson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willson:James", "Zhao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Zhao", "Weili Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Weili", "Ding-Zhu Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Ding=Zhu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
