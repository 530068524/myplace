{"title": "In support of city exploration.", "fields": ["conversation", "amateur", "mobile phone", "tying", "locative media"], "abstract": "The novel experience Anywhere allowed participants to explore an urban area, tying together information not normally available, new points of views and interaction embedded into physical places. Guided by 'unseen', on-the-street performers in an ongoing conversation maintained over mobile phones, they gained access to locative media and staged performances. Our analysis demonstrates how Anywhere produced engaging and uniquely personalised paths through a complex landscape of content, negotiated by the performer-participant pair around various conflicting constraints. We reflect our analysis through the lens of the key characteristics exhibited by mechanisms that support city exploration, before focussing on possible extensions to the technological support of teams of professional and amateur guides.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Ben Bedwell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bedwell:Ben", "Holger Schn\u00e4delbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schn=auml=delbach:Holger", "Steve Benford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benford:Steve", "Tom Rodden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodden:Tom", "Boriana Koleva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koleva:Boriana"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
