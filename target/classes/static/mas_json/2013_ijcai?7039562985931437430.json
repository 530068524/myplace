{"title": "Multi-Prototype Label Ranking with Novel Pairwise-to-Total-Rank Aggregation.", "fields": ["pairwise comparison", "machine learning", "preference learning", "pattern recognition", "ranking"], "abstract": "We propose a multi-prototype-based algorithm for online learning of soft pairwise-preferences over labels. The algorithm learns soft label preferences via minimization of the proposed soft rank-loss measure, and can learn from total orders as well as from various types of partial orders. The soft pairwise preference algorithm outputs are further aggregated to produce a total label ranking prediction using a novel aggregation algorithm that outperforms existing aggregation solutions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Temple University", "Temple University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Mihajlo Grbovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grbovic:Mihajlo", "Nemanja Djuric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Djuric:Nemanja", "Slobodan Vucetic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vucetic:Slobodan"], "pages": 7}
