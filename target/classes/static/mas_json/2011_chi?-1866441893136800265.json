{"title": "WYSIWYF: exploring and annotating volume data with a tangible handheld device.", "fields": ["slicing", "multi touch", "space mapping", "interaction design", "natural user interface"], "abstract": "Visual exploration of volume data often requires the user to manipulate the orientation and position of a slicing plane in order to observe, annotate or measure its internal structures. Such operations, with its many degrees of freedom in 3D space, map poorly into interaction modalities afforded by mouse-keyboard interfaces or flat multi-touch displays alone. We addressed this problem using a  what-you-see-is-what-you-feel  (WYSIWYF) approach, which integrates the natural user interface of a multi-touch wall display with the untethered physical dexterity provided by a handheld device with multi-touch and 3D-tilt sensing capabilities. A slicing plane can be directly and intuitively manipulated at any desired position within the displayed volume data using a commonly available mobile device such as the iPod touch. 2D image slices can be transferred wirelessly to this small touch screen device, where a novel fast fat finger annotation technique (F 3 AT) is proposed to perform accurate and speedy contour drawings. Our user studies support the efficacy of our proposed visual exploration and annotation interaction designs.", "citation": "Citations (42)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Peng Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Peng", "Wooi-Boon Goh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goh:Wooi=Boon", "Chi-Wing Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Chi=Wing", "Qiang Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Qiang", "Pheng-Ann Heng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heng:Pheng=Ann"], "pages": 10}
