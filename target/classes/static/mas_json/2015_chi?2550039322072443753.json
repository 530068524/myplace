{"title": "LeviPath: Modular Acoustic Levitation for 3D Path Visualisations.", "fields": ["acoustic levitation", "levitation", "hardware architecture", "standing wave", "modular design"], "abstract": "LeviPath is a modular system to levitate objects across 3D paths. It consists of two opposed arrays of transducers that create a standing wave capable of suspending objects in mid-air. To control the standing wave, the system employs a novel algorithm based on combining basic patterns of movement. Our approach allows the control of multiple beads simultaneously along different 3D paths. Due to the patterns and the use of only two opposed arrays, the system is modular and can scale its interaction space by joining several LeviPaths. In this paper, we describe the hardware architecture, the basic patterns of movement and how to combine them to produce 3D path visualisations.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Themis Omirou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Omirou:Themis", "Asier Marzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marzo:Asier", "Sue Ann Seah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seah:Sue_Ann", "Sriram Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Sriram"], "pages": 4}
