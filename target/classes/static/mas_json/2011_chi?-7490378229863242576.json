However, most of the research to date has focused on understanding, analyzing and designing for external interruptions. The causes of self-interruptions are not well understood. In this paper we present an analysis of 889 hours of observed task switching behavior from 36 individuals across three high-technology information work organizations. Our analysis suggests that self-interruption is a function of organizational environment and individual differences, but also external interruptions experienced. We find that people in open office environments interrupt themselves at a higher rate. We also find that people are significantly more likely to interrupt themselves to return to solitary work associated with central working spheres, suggesting that self-interruption occurs largely as a function of prospective memory events. The research presented contributes substantially to our understanding of attention and multitasking in context.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Irvine", "Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de M\u00e9xico"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Laura Dabbish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dabbish:Laura", "Gloria Mark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mark:Gloria", "V\u00edctor M.
