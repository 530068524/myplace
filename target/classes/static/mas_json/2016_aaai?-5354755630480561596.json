Therefore, they may improve the performance of distance based classifiers, e.g., kNN. Existing methods obtain multiple metrics of test data by either transductively assigning metrics for unlabeled instances or designing distance functions manually, which are with limited generalization ability. In this paper, we propose ISMETS (Instance Specific METric Subspace) framework which can automatically span the whole metric space in a generative manner and is able to inductively learn a specific metric subspace for each instance via inferring the expectation over the metric bases in a Bayesian manner. The whole framework can be solved with Variational Bayes (VB). Experiment on synthetic data shows that the learned results are with good interpretability. Moreover, comprehensive results on real world datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of ISMETS.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Han-Jia Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Han=Jia", "De-Chuan Zhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhan:De=Chuan", "Yuan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0001:Yuan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
