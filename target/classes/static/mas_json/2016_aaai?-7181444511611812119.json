{"title": "Learning Deep Representation from Big and Heterogeneous Data for Traffic Accident Inference.", "fields": ["public transport", "inference", "global positioning system", "autoencoder", "urban computing"], "abstract": "With the rapid development of urbanization and public transportation system, the number of traffic accidents have significantly increased globally over the past decades and become a big problem for human society. Facing these possible and unexpected traffic accidents, understanding what causes traffic accident and early alarms for some possible ones will play a critical role on planning effective traffic management. However, due to the lack of supported sensing data, research is very limited on the field of updating traffic accident risk in real-time. Therefore, in this paper, we collect big and heterogeneous data (7 months traffic accident data and 1.6 million users' GPS records) to understand how human mobility will affect traffic accident risk. By mining these data, we develop a deep model of Stack denoise Autoencoder to learn hierarchical feature representation of human mobility. And these features are used for efficient prediction of traffic accident risk level. Once the model has been trained, our model can simulate corresponding traffic accident risk map with given real-time input of human mobility. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our model and suggest that traffic accident risk can be significantly more predictable through human mobility.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Quanjun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Quanjun", "Xuan Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Xuan", "Harutoshi Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada:Harutoshi", "Ryosuke Shibasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shibasaki:Ryosuke"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
