The findings show that health information is organized and used based on what we called chronic care cycles - the repeated rotations of a routine medical visit with the subsequent homecare period. We suggest that future system design consider chronic care cycles to facilitate the use of health information in managing chronic diseases.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Institute for C ...
