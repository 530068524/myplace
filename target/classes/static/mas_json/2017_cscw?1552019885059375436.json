{"title": "Mass Participation During Emergency Response: Event-centric Crowdsourcing in Humanitarian Mapping.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "knowledge management", "computer science"], "abstract": "Crowdsourcing platforms have become important information providers after disaster events. While they can build on some prior experiences, it is not yet well understood how contributor capacity for such activities is constituted. To what extent are initiatives building a dormant task force that springs to action when it is needed? Alternatively, do they mainly rely on the recruitment of new contributors during disaster events, possibly at the expense of contribution quality? We seek to develop a better understanding of these relationships, using the example of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. In a large-scale quantitative study, we assess the outcomes of 26 campaigns with almost 20,000 participants. We find that event-centric campaigns can be significant recruiting and reactivation events, however that this is not guaranteed. Our analytical methods provide a means of interpreting key differences in outcomes. We close with recommendations relating to the promotion and coordination of event-centric campaigns in HOT and related platforms.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Martin Dittus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dittus:Martin", "Giovanni Quattrone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quattrone:Giovanni", "Licia Capra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capra:Licia"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
