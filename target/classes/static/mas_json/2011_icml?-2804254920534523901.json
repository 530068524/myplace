We extend to ranking problems a notion of order-preserving losses previously introduced for multiclass classification, and show that these losses lead to consistent formulations with respect to a family of ranking evaluation metrics. An order-preserving loss can be tailored for a given evaluation metric by appropriately setting some weights depending on this metric and the observed supervision. These weights, called the standard form of the supervision, do not always exist, but we show that previous consistency results for ranking were proved in special cases where they do. We then evaluate a new pairwise loss consistent with the (Normalized) Discounted Cumulative Gain on benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Laboratoire d'I ... 5 Paris, France", "Laboratoire d'I ... 5 Paris, France", "Laboratoire d'I ... 5 Paris, France", "Laboratoire d'I ... 5 Paris, France"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["David Buffoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buffoni:David", "Cl\u00e9ment Calauz\u00e8nes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calauz=egrave=nes:Cl=eacute=ment", "Patrick Gallinari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gallinari:Patrick", "Nicolas Usunier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Usunier:Nicolas"], "pages": 8}
