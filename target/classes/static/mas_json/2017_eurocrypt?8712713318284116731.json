{"title": "Private Puncturable PRFs from Standard Lattice Assumptions.", "fields": ["pseudorandom function family", "puncturing", "lattice", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "multilinear map", "private information retrieval", "security parameter"], "abstract": "A puncturable pseudorandom function (PRF) has a master key k that enables one to evaluate the PRF at all points of the domain, and has a punctured key \\(k_x\\) that enables one to evaluate the PRF at all points but one. The punctured key \\(k_x\\) reveals no information about the value of the PRF at the punctured point x. Punctured PRFs play an important role in cryptography, especially in applications of indistinguishability obfuscation. However, in previous constructions, the punctured key \\(k_x\\) completely reveals the punctured point x: given \\(k_x\\) it is easy to determine x. A private puncturable PRF is one where \\(k_x\\) reveals nothing about x. This concept was defined by Boneh, Lewi, and Wu, who showed the usefulness of private puncturing, and gave constructions based on multilinear maps. The question is whether private puncturing can be built from a standard (weaker) cryptographic assumption.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Fujitsu"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan", "Sam Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sam", "Hart William Montgomery.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montgomery:Hart_William"], "pages": 31}
