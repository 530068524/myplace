It is assumed that the given set of kernels are grouped into distinct components where each component is crucial for the learning task at hand. The formulation hence employs l\u221e regularization for promoting combinations at the component level and l1 regularization for promoting sparsity among kernels in each component. While previous attempts have formulated this as a non-convex problem, the formulation given here is an instance of non-smooth convex optimization problem which admits an efficient Mirror-Descent (MD) based procedure. The MD procedure optimizes over product of simplexes, which is not a well-studied case in literature. Results on real-world datasets show that the new MKL formulation is well-suited for object categorization tasks and that the MD based algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art MKL solvers like simpleMKL in terms of computational effort.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jagarlapudi Saketha Nath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nath:Jagarlapudi_Saketha", "G.
