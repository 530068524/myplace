{"title": "ZygOS: Achieving Low Tail Latency for Microsecond-scale Networked Tasks.", "fields": ["latency", "remote procedure call", "multi core processor", "speedup", "server"], "abstract": "This paper focuses on the efficient scheduling on multicore systems of very fine-grain networked tasks, which are the typical building block of online data-intensive applications. The explicit goal is to deliver high throughput (millions of remote procedure calls per second) for tail latency service-level objectives that are a small multiple of the task size.   We present ZYGOS, a system optimized for \u03bcs-scale, in-memory computing on multicore servers. It implements a work-conserving scheduler within a specialized operating system designed for high request rates and a large number of network connections. ZYGOS uses a combination of shared-memory data structures, multi-queue NICs, and inter-processor interrupts to rebalance work across cores.   For an aggressive service-level objective expressed at the 99th percentile, ZYGOS achieves 75% of the maximum possible load determined by a theoretical, zero-overhead model (centralized queueing with FCFS) for 10\u03bcs tasks, and 88% for 25\u03bcs tasks.   We evaluate ZYGOS with a networked version of Silo, a state-of-the-art in-memory transactional database, running TPC-C. For a service-level objective of 1000\u03bcs latency at the 99th percentile, ZYGOS can deliver a 1.63x speedup over Linux (because of its dataplane architecture) and a 1.26x speedup over IX, a state-of-the-art dataplane (because of its work-conserving scheduler).", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["George Prekas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prekas:George", "Marios Kogias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kogias:Marios", "Edouard Bugnion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bugnion:Edouard"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2017", "pages": 17}
