{"title": "A Probabilistic Framework for Multimodal Retrieval using Integrative Indian Buffet Process.", "fields": ["relevance feedback", "indian buffet process", "probabilistic logic", "divergence from randomness model", "binary code"], "abstract": "We propose a multimodal retrieval procedure based on latent feature models. The procedure consists of a Bayesian nonparametric framework for learning underlying semantically meaningful abstract features in a multimodal dataset, a probabilistic retrieval model that allows cross-modal queries and an extension model for relevance feedback. Experiments on two multimodal datasets, PASCAL-Sentence and SUN-Attribute, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed retrieval procedure in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms for learning binary codes.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Bahadir Ozdemir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ozdemir:Bahadir", "Larry S.
