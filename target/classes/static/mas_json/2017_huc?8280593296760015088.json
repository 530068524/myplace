Teachers, trainers, textbooks, instruction movies, etc. has been introduced for the transmission. New methods that enhance transmission of human experiences are always desired according to the social and economic situations. Recent developments of virtual reality (VR), augmented realty (AR) and augmented human (AH) technologies make us expect a future that we can instantaneously (or at least more efficiently) transfer the skills or knowledges from one to another, like in Sci-Fi movies. However, for that, we need to optimize the transmission method for each person. We propose the augmented-human based approach for the experience transmission, and review some factors that are essential but not well focused in past studies.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Information Som ... y, Tokyo, JAPAN", "Information Som ... y, Tokyo, JAPAN", "Information Som ... y, Tokyo, JAPAN"], "authors": ["Sohei Wakisaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wakisaka:Sohei", "Atsushi Hiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hiyama:Atsushi", "Masahiko Inami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inami:Masahiko"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
