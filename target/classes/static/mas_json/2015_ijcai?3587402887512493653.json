This network can capture active features for unseen segments of a sentence to measure how likely the segments are merged to be the constituents. Given an input sentence, after all the scores of possible segments are computed, an efficient dynamic programming parsing algorithm is used to find the globally optimal parse tree. A similar network is then applied to predict syntactic categories for every node in the parse tree. Our networks archived competitive performance to existing benchmark parsers on the CTB-5 dataset without any task-specific feature engineering.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Xiaoqing Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Xiaoqing", "Haoyuan Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Haoyuan", "Yi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yi", "Pengjing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Pengjing", "Wenqiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wenqiang"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
