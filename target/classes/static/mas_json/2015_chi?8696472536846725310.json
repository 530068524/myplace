{"title": "A Spreadsheet Model for Handling Streaming Data.", "fields": ["web service", "data stream", "data mining", "streaming data", "metadata"], "abstract": "We present a spreadsheet model for working with streaming data. Our prototype tool presents techniques to let the user stream data from web services and web input elements to a spreadsheet without preprogramming those sources into the tool. Spreadsheet cells record metadata about where and when the data came from, allowing the user to view and manipulate streaming data using temporal information. Starting and pausing a data stream in the spreadsheet can be controlled programmatically using values computed by spreadsheet cells, making the spreadsheet program highly dynamic and interactive. We demonstrate the range of our design with a series of examples highlighting its ability to create different kinds of applications that process real-time data from the web using simple spreadsheet formulas.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kerry Shih-Ping Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kerry_Shih=Ping", "Brad A.
