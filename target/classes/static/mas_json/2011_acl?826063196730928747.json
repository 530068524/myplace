{"title": "Piggyback: Using Search Engines for Robust Cross-Domain Named Entity Recognition.", "fields": ["information retrieval", "security token", "novelty", "named entity recognition", "search engine"], "abstract": "We use search engine results to address a particularly difficult cross-domain language processing task, the adaptation of named entity recognition (NER) from news text to web queries. The key novelty of the method is that we submit a token with context to a search engine and use similar contexts in the search results as additional information for correctly classifying the token. We achieve strong gains in NER performance on news, in-domain and out-of-domain, and on web queries.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "Google", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Stefan R\u00fcd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=uuml=d:Stefan", "Massimiliano Ciaramita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciaramita:Massimiliano", "Jens M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Jens", "Hinrich Sch\u00fctze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=tze:Hinrich"], "pages": 11}
