{"title": "A Counter-example to Karlin's Strong Conjecture for Fictitious Play.", "fields": ["normal form game", "fictitious play", "conjecture", "zero sum game", "identity matrix"], "abstract": "Fictitious play is a natural dynamic for equilibrium play in zero-sum games, proposed by Brown [6], and shown to converge by Robinson [33]. Samuel Karlin conjectured in 1959 that fictitious play converges at rate O(t -- 1/2) with respect to the number of steps t. We disprove this conjecture by showing that, when the payoff matrix of the row player is the n \u00d7 n identity matrix, fictitious play may converge (for some tie-breaking) at rate as slow as a#x3A9;(t -- 1/n).", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Constantinos Daskalakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daskalakis:Constantinos", "Qinxuan Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Qinxuan"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
