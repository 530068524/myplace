While previous work has mostly addressed search, visualization and sense-making tasks, we have designed an abstract classification task that involves explicit data manipulation. Based on our observations of real uses of a wall display, this task represents a large category of applications. We report on a controlled experiment that uses this task to compare physical navigation in front of a wall-size display with virtual navigation using pan-and-zoom on the desktop. Our main finding is a robust interaction effect between display type and task difficulty: while the desktop can be faster than the wall for simple tasks, the wall gains a sizable advantage as the task becomes more difficult. A follow-up study shows that other desktop techniques (overview+detail, lens) do not perform better than pan-and-zoom and are therefore slower than the wall for difficult tasks.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Can Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Can", "Olivier Chapuis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chapuis:Olivier", "Michel Beaudouin-Lafon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beaudouin=Lafon:Michel", "Eric Lecolinet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lecolinet:Eric", "Wendy E.
