The main strength of this methodology lies in its ability to account for the randomness in the nodes' location jointly with an accurate description at the physical layer, based on the SINR, that allows to consider also random fading on each link. Existing models of CSMA networks adopting the stochastic geometry approach suffer from two important weaknesses: 1) they permit to evaluate only spatial averages of the main performance measures, thus hiding possibly huge discrepancies in the performance achieved by individual nodes; 2) they are analytically tractable only when nodes are distributed over the area according to simple spatial processes (e.g., the Poisson point process). In this paper we show how the stochastic geometry approach can be extended to overcome the above limitations, allowing to obtain node throughput distributions as well as to analyze a significant class of topologies in which nodes are not independently placed.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Turin", "University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin"], "authors": ["Giusi Alfano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alfano:Giusi", "Michele Garetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garetto:Michele", "Emilio Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Emilio"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
