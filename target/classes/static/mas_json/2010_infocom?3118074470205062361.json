{"title": "A Practical On-line Pacing Scheme at Edges of Small Buffer Networks.", "fields": ["burstiness", "edge", "packet switching", "tcp pacing", "packet loss"], "abstract": "For the optical packet-switching routers to be widely deployed in the Internet, the size of packet buffers on routers has to be significantly small. Such small-buffer networks rely on traffic with low levels of burstiness to avoid buffer overflows and packet losses. We present a pacing system that proactively shapes traffic in the edge network to reduce burstiness. Our queue length based pacing uses an adaptive pacing on a single queue and paces traffic indiscriminately where deployed. In this work, we show through analysis and simulation that this pacing approach introduces a bounded delay and that it effectively reduces traffic burstiness. We also show that it can achieve higher throughput than end-system based pacing.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Yan Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai_0002:Yan", "Bo Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0003:Bo", "Tilman Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Tilman", "Weibo Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Weibo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
