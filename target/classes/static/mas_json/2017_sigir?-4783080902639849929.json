Therefore, professionals are needed for the implementation and configuration of retrieval systems and retrieval components. Our web-based application, called Xtrieval Web Lab, enables newcomers and learners to gain practical knowledge about the information retrieval process. They can arrange a multitude of components of retrieval systems and evaluate them with real world data without utilizing a programming language. Game mechanics guide the learners in their discovery process and motivate them.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chemnitz University of Technology", "Chemnitz University of Technology", "Chemnitz University of Technology"], "authors": ["Thomas Wilhelm-Stein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilhelm=Stein:Thomas", "Stefan Kahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kahl:Stefan", "Maximilian Eibl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eibl:Maximilian"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
