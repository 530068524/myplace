Statistical relational learning is a natural fit for analyzing EMRs but is less adept at handling their inherent latent structure, such as connections between related medications or diseases. One way to capture the latent structure is via a relational clustering of objects. We propose a novel approach that, instead of pre-clustering the objects, performs a demand-driven clustering during learning. We evaluate our algorithm on three real-world tasks where the goal is to use EMRs to predict whether a patient will have an adverse reaction to a medication. We find that our approach is more accurate than performing no clustering, pre-clustering, and using expert-constructed medical heterarchies.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of Porto", "Marshfield Clinic", "Marshfield Clinic", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Jesse Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Jesse", "V\u00edtor Santos Costa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costa:V=iacute=tor_Santos", "Elizabeth Berg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berg:Elizabeth", "David Page.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Page:David", "Peggy L.
