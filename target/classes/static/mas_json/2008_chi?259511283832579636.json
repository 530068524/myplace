In this work, we explore web tasks that require multiple web sessions to complete (multi-session tasks) to satisfy a goal. We conducted a web-based diary study and a field study that used a customized version of Firefox which logged the participants' interactions for multi-session tasks and all their web activity. We found that multi-session tasks occur frequently and that users utilize a variety of browser tools and actions to help complete these tasks.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Dalhousie University", "Dalhousie University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Bonnie MacKay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/MacKay:Bonnie", "Carolyn R.
