We show that there is a unified speed upper bound for broadcast and unicast communications in large wireless networks. When network connectivity and successful packet delivery are considered, this speed upper bound is a function of node density. As this bound is unreachable with finite node density, we also quantify the gap between the actually achieved speed and the desired upper bound, which converges to zero exponentially as the node density increases to infinity.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Yi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yi", "Wenye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wenye"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 5}
