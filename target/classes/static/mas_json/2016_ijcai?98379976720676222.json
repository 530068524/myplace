{"title": "Verifying Existence of Resource-Bounded Coalition Uniform Strategies.", "fields": ["omniscience", "bounded function", "syntax", "management science", "decidability"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of whether a coalition of agents has a knowledge-based strategy to ensure some outcome under a resource bound. We extend previous work on verification of multi-agent systems where actions of agents produce and consume resources, by adding epistemic pre- and postconditions to actions. This allows us to model scenarios where agents perform both actions which change the world, and actions which change their knowledge about the world, such as observation and communication. To avoid logical omniscience and obtain a compact model of the system, our model of agents' knowledge is syntactic. We define a class of coalition-uniform strategies with respect to any (decidable) notion of coalition knowledge. We show that the model-checking problem for the resulting logic is decidable for any notion of coalition-uniform strategies in these classes.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "Utrecht University", "University of Nottingham"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Natasha Alechina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alechina:Natasha", "Mehdi Dastani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dastani:Mehdi", "Brian Logan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Logan:Brian"], "pages": 7}
