In this paper, we study the effects of the addition of an equivalence relation ~ to one of the most representative interval temporal logics, namely, the logic ?????? \ufffd of Allen's relations meets, begun by, and begins. We first prove that the satisfiability problem for the resulting logic ?????? \ufffd ~ remains decidable over finite linear orders, but it becomes nonprimitive recursive, while decidability is lost over N. We also show that decidability over N can be recovered by restricting to a suitable subset of models. Then, we show that ?????? \ufffd ~ is expressive enough to define ????-regular languages, thus establishing a promising connection between interval temporal logics and extended ??-regular languages.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Udine", "University of Verona"], "authors": ["Angelo Montanari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montanari:Angelo", "Pietro Sala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sala:Pietro"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
