{"title": "Why Did They Do That?: Exploring Attribution Mismatches Between Native and Non-Native Speakers Using Videoconferencing.", "fields": ["impression", "videoconferencing", "computer mediated communication", "cognitive load", "impression management"], "abstract": "The meaning we attribute to another's actions significantly impact our subsequent behaviors and interactions towards that person. Distributed teams often combine native speakers (NS) and non-native speakers (NNS) and are particularly prone to making attribution errors. Language difficulties place NNS under a higher cognitive load, potentially leading NS to make inaccurate attributions of NNS. We conducted an exploratory laboratory study to investigate the attributions NS and NNS form about each other in multiparty videoconferencing. Our findings revealed significant mismatches in NS' attributions of NNS behavior, but no significant mismatch in NNS' attributions of NS behavior. Due to cognitive overload stemming from language challenges, NNS were only able to engage in \"compromised\" impression management during the task. Yet, NS were relatively unaware of how profoundly language difficulties impacted NNS' behaviors. Our findings identify opportunities for technology support for NS-NNS interactions, particularly with regards to impression construction and impression management.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Kyoto University", "University of Zurich"], "authors": ["Helen Ai He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Helen_Ai", "Naomi Yamashita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamashita:Naomi", "Ari Hautasaari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hautasaari:Ari", "Xun Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xun", "Elaine M.
