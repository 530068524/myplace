{"title": "Calling-to-reference context translation via constraint-guided CFL-reachability.", "fields": ["debugging", "reachability", "root cause", "heap", "static analysis"], "abstract": "A calling context is an important piece of information used widely to help developers understand program executions (e.g., for debugging). While calling contexts offer useful control information, information regarding data involved in a bug (e.g., what data structure holds a leaking object), in many cases, can bring developers closer to the bug's root cause. Such data information, often exhibited as heap reference paths, has already been needed by many tools.     The only way for a dynamic analysis to record complete reference paths is to perform heap dumping, which incurs huge runtime overhead and renders the analysis impractical. This paper presents a novel static analysis that can precisely infer, from a calling context of a method that contains a use (e.g., read or write) of an object, the heap reference paths leading to the object at the time the use occurs. Since calling context recording is much less expensive, our technique provides benefits for all dynamic techniques that need heap information, significantly reducing their overhead.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Davis", "Nanjing University", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Cheng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Cheng", "Qirun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qirun", "Zhiqiang Zuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuo:Zhiqiang", "Khanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Khanh", "Guoqing Harry Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Guoqing_Harry", "Zhendong Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Zhendong"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2018", "pages": 15}
