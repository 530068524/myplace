{"title": "Semi-Supervised Learning via Compact Latent Space Clustering.", "fields": ["semi supervised learning", "network architecture", "regularization", "inductive reasoning", "feature vector"], "abstract": "We present a novel cost function for semi-supervised learning of neural networks that encourages compact clustering of the latent space to facilitate separation. The key idea is to dynamically create a graph over embeddings of labeled and unlabeled samples of a training batch to capture underlying structure in feature space, and use label propagation to estimate its high and low density regions. We then devise a cost function based on Markov chains on the graph that regularizes the latent space to form a single compact cluster per class, while avoiding to disturb existing clusters during optimization. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks and compare to state-of-the art with promising results. Our approach combines the benefits of graph-based regularization with efficient, inductive inference, does not require modifications to a network architecture, and can thus be easily applied to existing networks to enable an effective use of unlabeled data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Konstantinos Kamnitsas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamnitsas:Konstantinos", "Daniel C.
