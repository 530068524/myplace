A counting query on a database  D  \u2208 ({0, 1}  d  )  n   has the form \"What fraction of the individual records in the database satisfy the property  q ?\" We show that in order to answer an arbitrary set  Q  of \u00bb  nd  counting queries on  D  to within error \u00b1 \u03b1  it is necessary that   [EQUATION]   This bound is optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors, as demonstrated by the Private Multiplicative Weights algorithm (Hardt and Rothblum, FOCS'10). It is also the first to show that the sample complexity required for ( e, \u0394 )-differential privacy is asymptotically larger than what is required merely for accuracy, which is  O (log | Q |/ \u03b1  2 ). In addition, we show that our lower bound holds for the specific case of  k -way marginal queries (where | Q | = 2  k  ( d/k )) when  \u03b1  is a constant.   Our results rely on the existence of short  fingerprinting codes  (Boneh and Shaw, CRYPTO'95; Tardos, STOC'03), which we show are closely connected to the sample complexity of differentially private data release. We also give a new method for combining certain types of sample complexity lower bounds into stronger lower bounds.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Mark Bun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bun:Mark", "Jonathan Ullman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ullman:Jonathan", "Salil P.
