But there is still a lack of both empirical data and predictive models that explore the pattern of user behavior in the process. We propose a model to predict user performance with two types of Chinese pinyin input methods on mobile phones. The model integrates a language model (digraph probability) with Fitts' law for key presses, a keystroke-level model for navigation, and a linear model for visual search in pinyin marks and Chinese characters. We tested the model by comparing its predictions with the empirical measures. The predictions are satisfactory and the percentage differences are all within 4% of the empirical results, suggesting that the model can be used to evaluate user performance of Chinese pinyin text entry solutions on mobile phones.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Nokia", "University of Tampere"], "authors": ["Ying Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ying", "Kari-Jouko R\u00e4ih\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=ih=auml=:Kari=Jouko"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
