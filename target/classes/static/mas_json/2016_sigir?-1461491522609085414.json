Several PRF methods have so far been proposed for many retrieval models. Recent theoretical studies of PRF methods show that most of the PRF methods do not satisfy all necessary constraints. Among all, the log-logistic model has been shown to be an effective method that satisfies most of the PRF constraints. In this paper, we first introduce two new PRF constraints. We further analyze the log-logistic feedback model and show that it does not satisfy these two constraints as well as the previously proposed \"relevance effect\" constraint. We then modify the log-logistic formulation to satisfy all these constraints. Experiments on three TREC newswire and web collections demonstrate that the proposed modification significantly outperforms the original log-logistic model, in all collections.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Tehran", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Tehran"], "authors": ["Ali Montazeralghaem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montazeralghaem:Ali", "Hamed Zamani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zamani:Hamed", "Azadeh Shakery.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shakery:Azadeh"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
