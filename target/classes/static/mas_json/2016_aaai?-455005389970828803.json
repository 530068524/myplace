Concurrently, many web-based applications, such as news article recommendation and online ad placement, can be modeled as budget-limited problems. However, the diversification problem under a budget constraint has not been considered. In this paper, we first introduce the budget constraint to linear submodular bandits as a new problem called the linear submodular bandits with a knapsack constraint. We then define an \u03b1-approximation unit-cost regret considering that submodular function maximization is NP-hard. To solve this problem, we propose two greedy algorithms based on a modified UCB rule. We then prove these two algorithms with different regret bounds and computational costs. We also conduct a number of experiments and the experimental results confirm our theoretical analyses.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Melbourne", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "authors": ["Baosheng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Baosheng", "Meng Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Meng", "Dacheng Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Dacheng"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
