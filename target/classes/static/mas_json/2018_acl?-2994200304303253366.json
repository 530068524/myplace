We assess the quality of generated poems using crowd and expert judgements. The stress and rhyme models perform very well, as generated poems are largely indistinguishable from human-written poems. Expert evaluation, however, reveals that a vanilla language model captures meter implicitly, and that machine-generated poems still underperform in terms of readability and emotion. Our research shows the importance expert evaluation for poetry generation, and that future research should look beyond rhyme/meter and focus on poetic language.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["King's College London", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Toronto", "San Diego State University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Timothy Baldwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baldwin:Timothy", "Trevor Cohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohn:Trevor", "Julian Brooke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brooke:Julian", "Jey Han Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Jey_Han", "Adam Hammond.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hammond:Adam"], "pages": 11}
