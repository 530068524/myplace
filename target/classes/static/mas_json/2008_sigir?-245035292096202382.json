{"title": "Discovering key concepts in verbose queries.", "fields": ["weighting", "statistical model", "natural language", "search engine", "tf idf"], "abstract": "Current search engines do not, in general, perform well with longer, more verbose queries. One of the main issues in processing these queries is identifying the key concepts that will have the most impact on effectiveness. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a technique that uses query-dependent, corpus-dependent, and corpus-independent features for automatic extraction of key concepts from verbose queries. We show that our method achieves higher accuracy in the identification of key concepts than standard weighting methods such as inverse document frequency. Finally, we propose a probabilistic model for integrating the weighted key concepts identified by our method into a query, and demonstrate that this integration significantly improves retrieval effectiveness for a large set of natural language description queries derived from TREC topics on several newswire and web collections.", "citation": "Citations (277)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Michael Bendersky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bendersky:Michael", "W.
