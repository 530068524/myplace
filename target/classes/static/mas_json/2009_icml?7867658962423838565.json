Extant approaches use MLE estimates of parameters  r   i   to obtain point estimates of the Model Quality. We describe a Bayesian alternative to assessing the quality of these models that builds an MRF over the parameters of each model and performs approximate inference to integrate over them. Hyperparameters  w  are learnt by optimizing a list-wise loss function over training data. Our results indicate that our Bayesian approach can significantly outperform MLE estimates and that optimizing the hyper-parameters can further improve results.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Hetunandan Kamisetty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamisetty:Hetunandan", "Christopher James Langmead.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langmead:Christopher_James"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
