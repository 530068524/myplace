This technology now enables new forms of tracking and sharing outdoor adventures, that go beyond prosaic descriptions and photographs of the tour. Existing web mapping services and online tour diaries already allow mountaineers an improved preparation of tours but it remains still a time-consuming and cumbersome task. In this paper we introduce the concept of  pioneers in outdoor activities.  The proposed concept lets people define their pioneers, which are other ambitious athletes who are well known and trusted experts of the area. Using the segments of their tracks and other personal preferences (e.g. length, elevation and difficulty) a personalized route that is based on the pioneers' activities is generated and recommended to the user.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany", "DFKI, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"], "authors": ["Florian Daiber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daiber:Florian", "Felix Kosmalla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosmalla:Felix", "Frederik Wiehr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiehr:Frederik", "Antonio Kr\u00fcger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=uuml=ger:Antonio"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
