{"title": "More efficient oblivious transfer and extensions for faster secure computation.", "fields": ["oblivious transfer", "distributed computing", "public key cryptography", "secure two party computation", "secure multi party computation", "small number", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Protocols for secure computation enable parties to compute a joint function on their private inputs without revealing anything but the result. A foundation for secure computation is oblivious transfer (OT), which traditionally requires expensive public key cryptography. A more efficient way to perform many OTs is to extend a small number of base OTs using OT extensions based on symmetric cryptography.   In this work we present optimizations and efficient implementations of OT and OT extensions in the semi-honest model. We propose a novel OT protocol with security in the standard model and improve OT extensions with respect to communication complexity, computation complexity, and scalability. We also provide specific optimizations of OT extensions that are tailored to the secure computation protocols of Yao and Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson and reduce the communication complexity even further. We experimentally verify the efficiency gains of our protocols and optimizations. By applying our implementation to current secure computation frameworks, we can securely compute a Levenshtein distance circuit with 1.29 billion AND gates at a rate of 1.2 million AND gates per second. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of correctly implementing OT within secure computation protocols by presenting an attack on the FastGC framework.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Gilad Asharov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asharov:Gilad", "Yehuda Lindell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindell:Yehuda", "Thomas Schneider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schneider_0003:Thomas", "Michael Zohner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zohner:Michael"], "pages": 14}
