Although these tasks have received much attention in the web search literature, the Twitter context introduces a real-time \"twist\": after significant breaking news events, we aim to provide relevant results within minutes. This paper provides a case study illustrating the challenges of real-time data processing in the era of \"big data\". We tell the story of how our system was built twice: our first implementation was built on a typical Hadoop-based analytics stack, but was later replaced because it did not meet the latency requirements necessary to generate meaningful real-time results. The second implementation, which is the system deployed in production today, is a custom in-memory processing engine specifically designed for the task. This experience taught us that the current typical usage of Hadoop as a \"big data\" platform, while great for experimentation, is not well suited to low-latency processing, and points the way to future work on data analytics platforms that can handle \"big\" as well as \"fast\" data.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Twitter", "Twitter", "Twitter", "Twitter", "Twitter"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Gilad Mishne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mishne:Gilad", "Jeff Dalton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dalton_0001:Jeff", "Zhenghua Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhenghua", "Aneesh Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Aneesh", "Jimmy J.
