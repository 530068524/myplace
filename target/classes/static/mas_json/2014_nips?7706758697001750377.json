It finds the optimal policy in belief space, which explicitly accounts for the expected effect on future rewards of reductions in uncertainty. However, the Bayes-adaptive solution is typically intractable in domains with large or continuous state spaces. We present a tractable method for approximating the Bayes-adaptive solution by combining simulation-based search with a novel value function approximation technique that generalises appropriately over belief space. Our method outperforms prior approaches in both discrete bandit tasks and simple continuous navigation and control tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Gatsby Unit, UCL"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Arthur Guez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guez:Arthur", "Nicolas Heess.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heess:Nicolas", "David Silver.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silver:David", "Peter Dayan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dayan:Peter"], "pages": 9}
