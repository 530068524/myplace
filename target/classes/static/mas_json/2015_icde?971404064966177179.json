{"title": "DBMS on modern storage hardware.", "fields": ["flash file system", "database transaction", "raid", "append", "granularity"], "abstract": "In the present tutorial we perform a cross-cut analysis of database systems from the perspective of modern storage technology, namely Flash memory. We argue that neither the design of modern DBMS, nor the architecture of Flash storage technologies are aligned with each other. The result is needlessly suboptimal DBMS performance and inefficient Flash utilisation as well as low Flash storage endurance and reliability. We showcase new DBMS approaches with improved algorithms and leaner architectures, designed to leverage the properties of modern storage technologies. We cover the area of transaction management and multi-versioning, putting a special emphasis on: (i) version organisation models and invalidation mechanisms in multi-versioning DBMS; (ii) Flash storage management especially on append-based storage in tuple granularity; (iii) Flash-friendly buffer management; as well as (iv) improvements in the searching and indexing models. Furthermore, we present our NoFTL approach to native Flash access that integrates parts of the Flash-management functionality into the DBMS yielding significant performance increase and simplification of the I/O stack. In addition, we cover the basics of building large Flash storage for DBMS and revisit some of the RAID techniques and principles.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Reutlingen University", "Technical Unive ... mstadt, Germany", "Technical Unive ... mstadt, Germany"], "authors": ["Ilia Petrov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrov:Ilia", "Robert Gottstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottstein:Robert", "Sergej Hardock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardock:Sergej"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
