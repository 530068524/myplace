The wide variety of sharing behaviors generate different metadata which pose new opportunities for the discovery of communities. We propose a new approach, named context-based friend suggestion, to leverage the diverse form of contextual cues for more effective friend suggestion in the social media community. Different from existing approaches, we consider both visual and geographical cues, and develop two user-based similarity measurements, i.e.,  visual similarity  and  geo similarity  for characterizing user relationship. The problem of friend suggestion is casted as a contextual graph modeling problem, where users are nodes and the edges between them are weighted by  geo similarity . Meanwhile, the graph is initialized in a way that users with higher  visual similarity  to a given query have better chance to be recommended. Experimental results on a dataset of 13,876 users and ~1.5 million of their shared photos demonstrated that the proposed approach is consistent with human perception and outperforms other works.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Ting Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Ting", "Chong-Wah Ngo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ngo:Chong=Wah", "Tao Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Tao"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
