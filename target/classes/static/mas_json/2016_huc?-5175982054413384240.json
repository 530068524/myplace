Sharing of mobile sensor data, especially physiological data, raise different privacy challenges, that of protecting private behaviors that can be revealed from time series of sensor data. Existing privacy mechanisms rely on noise addition and data perturbation. But the accuracy requirement on inferences drawn from physiological data, together with well-established limits within which these data values occur, render traditional privacy mechanisms inapplicable. In this work, we define a new behavioral privacy metric based on differential privacy and propose a novel data substitution mechanism to protect behavioral privacy. We evaluate the efficacy of our scheme using 660 hours of ECG, respiration, and activity data collected from 43 participants and demonstrate that it is possible to retain meaningful utility, in terms of inference accuracy (90%), while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive behaviors.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Memphis", "IBM", "University of Memphis", "Nokia", "University of Memphis"], "authors": ["Nazir Saleheen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saleheen:Nazir", "Supriyo Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty:Supriyo", "Nasir Ali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ali:Nasir", "Md.
