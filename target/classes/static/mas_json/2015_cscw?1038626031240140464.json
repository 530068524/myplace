{"title": "Piloting TrACE: Exploring Spatiotemporal Anchored Collaboration in Asynchronous Learning.", "fields": ["software deployment", "annotation", "asynchronous learning", "computer supported collaborative learning", "affordance"], "abstract": "The use of multimedia content such as video is becoming more prevalent in educational environments. However, current platforms for hosting these media provide few collaborative tools to foster social learning between students or request help from instructors. In this paper, we explore the potential of spatiotemporal anchored collaboration, and we present a prototype media-playback environment called TrACE that exemplifies the approach. We examine a first design-based research (DBR) pilot deployment of TrACE in two post-secondary courses. Results indicate that students do take advantage of the system's affordances to interact in meaningful ways, though overall student annotation authoring was limited. Using the pilot data, we propose socio-technical modifications for the next iteration in the DBR cycle. Specifically we focus on tools to support instructors' use of the system and for promoting collaboration between students.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Nebraska Omaha", "University of Hartford", "University of Hartford"], "authors": ["Brian Dorn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dorn:Brian", "Larissa B.
