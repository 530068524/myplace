This gives alternative proofs of the separations of m-NC from m-P and of m-NC i  from m-NC i+1 , different from Raz-McKenzie (Combinatorica '99). The enumerative-combinatorial and Fourier analytic techniques in this work are very different from a large body of work on circuit depth lower bounds, and may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Siu Man Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Siu_Man", "Aaron Potechin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Potechin:Aaron"], "pages": 10}
