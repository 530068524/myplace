These devices will operate using very low ambient energy, such as energy harvested from indoor lights. We focus on characterizing the light energy availability in indoor environments and on developing energy allocation algorithms for energy harvesting devices. First, we present results of our long-term indoor radiant energy measurements, which provide important inputs required for algorithm and system design (e.g., determining the required battery sizes). Then, we focus on algorithm development, which requires nontraditional approaches, since energy harvesting shifts the nature of energy-aware protocols from minimizing energy expenditure to optimizing it. Moreover, in many cases, different energy storage types (rechargeable battery and a capacitor) require different algorithms. We develop algorithms for calculating time fair energy allocation in systems with deterministic energy inputs, as well as in systems where energy inputs are stochastic.", "citation": "Citations (271)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Maria Gorlatova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorlatova:Maria", "Aya Wallwater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wallwater:Aya", "Gil Zussman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zussman:Gil"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
