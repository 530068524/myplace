{"title": "Near-optimal algorithms for shared filter evaluation in data stream systems.", "fields": ["set cover problem", "binary logarithm", "randomized algorithm", "data stream mining", "query optimization"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of evaluating multiple overlapping queries defined on data streams, where each query is a conjunction of multiple filters and each filter may be shared across multiple queries. Efficient support for overlapping queries is a critical issue in the emerging data stream systems, and this is particularly the case when filters are expensive in terms of their computational complexity and processing time. This problem generalizes other well-known problems such as pipelined filter ordering and set cover, and is not only NP-Hard but also hard to approximate within a factor of  o (log  n ) from the optimum, where  n  is the number of queries. In this paper, we present two near-optimal approximation lgorithms with provably-good performance guarantees for the evaluation of overlapping queries. We present an  edge-coverage based Greedy  algorithm which achieves an approximation ratio of (1 + log( n ) + log(\u03b1)), where  n  is the number of queries and \u03b1 is the average number of filters in a query. We also present a randomized, fast and easily parallelizable  Harmonic  algorithm which achieves an approximation ratio of 2\u03b2, where \u03b2 is the maximum number of filters in a query. We have implemented these algorithms in a prototype system, and evaluated their performance using extensive experiments in the context of multimedia stream analysis. The results show that our  Greedy  algorithm consistently outperforms other known algorithms under various settings and scales well as the numbers of queries and filters increase.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Zhen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Zhen", "Srinivasan Parthasarathy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parthasarathy_0002:Srinivasan", "Anand Ranganathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranganathan:Anand", "Hao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Hao"], "pages": 14}
