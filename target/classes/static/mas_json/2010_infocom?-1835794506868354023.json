Life time has often been defined as the time elapsed until the first node is out of battery power. In the context of static networks, this could lead to disconnectivity. In contrast, Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) leverage the mobility of relay nodes to compensate for lack of permanent connectivity, and thus enable communication even after some nodes deplete their stored energy. One can thus consider the lifetimes of nodes as some additional parameters that can be controlled to optimize the performance of a DTN. In this paper, we consider two ways in which the energy state of a mobile can be controlled. Both listening and transmission require energy, besides each of these has a different type of effect on the network performance. Therefore we consider a joint optimization problem consisting of: i) activation, which determines when a mobile will turn on in order to receive packets, and ii) transmission control, which regulates the beaconing. The optimal solutions are shown to be of the threshold type. The findings are validated through extensive simulations.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "CREATE-NET, Trento, Italy"], "authors": ["Eitan Altman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altman:Eitan", "Amar Prakash Azad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azad:Amar_Prakash", "Tamer Basar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basar:Tamer", "Francesco De Pellegrini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pellegrini:Francesco_De"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
