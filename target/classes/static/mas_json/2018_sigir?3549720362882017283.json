{"title": "LogCanvas: Visualizing Search History Using Knowledge Graphs.", "fields": ["timeline", "information retrieval", "visualization", "web search query", "graph"], "abstract": "In this demo paper, we introduce LogCanvas, a platform for user search history visualization.Different from the existing visualization tools, LogCanvas focuses on helping users re-construct the semantic relationship among their search activities. LogCanvas segments a user's search history into different sessions and generates a knowledge graph to represent the information exploration process in each session.A knowledge graph is composed of the most important concepts or entities discovered by each search query as well as their relationships. It thus captures the semantic relationship among the queries.LogCanvas offers a session timeline viewer and a snippets viewer to enable users to re-find their previous search results efficiently. LogCanvas also provides a collaborative perspective to support a group of users in sharing search results and experience.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Renmin University of China", "Leibniz University of Hanover", "East China Normal University", "Leibniz University of Hanover"], "authors": ["Luyan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Luyan", "Zeon Trevor Fernando.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fernando:Zeon_Trevor", "Xuan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Xuan", "Wolfgang Nejdl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nejdl:Wolfgang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
