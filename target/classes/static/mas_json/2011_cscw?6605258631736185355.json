{"title": "Eliciting risk perceptions with an online game: preliminary results.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "influence diagram", "casual", "perception", "risk perception"], "abstract": "We describe a scientific casual browser game called Link IT  for eliciting societal risk perceptions in the form of mental models represented as influence diagrams. Given this knowledge, we can highlight similarities and differences across demographic groups as well as compare individual responses with expert models. These comparisons inform how risk should be best communicated to resolve knowledge gaps and misperceptions. Here we introduce the Link IT  concept, present preliminary results and propose future work.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["William L.
