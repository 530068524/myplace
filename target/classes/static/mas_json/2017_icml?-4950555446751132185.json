In this work, we propose a data-driven approach that leverages the approximation power of deep-learning with the precision of standard solvers to obtain fast and highly realistic simulations. Our method solves the incompressible Euler equations using the standard operator splitting method, in which a large sparse linear system with many free parameters must be solved. We use a Convolutional Network with a highly tailored architecture, trained using a novel unsupervised learning framework to solve the linear system. We present real-time 2D and 3D simulations that outperform recently proposed data-driven methods; the obtained results are realistic and show good generalization properties.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jonathan Tompson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tompson:Jonathan", "Kristofer Schlachter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schlachter:Kristofer", "Pablo Sprechmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sprechmann:Pablo", "Ken Perlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perlin:Ken"], "pages": 10}
