Network provenance describes the history and derivations of network state that result from the execution of a distributed protocol. It has broad applicability in the management, diagnosis, and security analysis of networks. Our demonstration shows the use of NetTrails for maintaining and querying network provenance in a variety of distributed settings, ranging from declarative networks to unmodified legacy distributed systems. We conclude our demonstration with a discussion of our ongoing research on enhancing the query language and security guarantees.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Wenchao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Wenchao", "Qiong Fei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fei:Qiong", "Shengzhi Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Shengzhi", "Tao Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Tao", "Andreas Haeberlen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haeberlen:Andreas", "Zachary G.
