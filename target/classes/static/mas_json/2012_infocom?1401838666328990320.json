{"title": "TAHES: Truthful double Auction for Heterogeneous Spectrums.", "fields": ["auction theory", "double auction", "frequency allocation", "diversity scheme", "spectrum auction"], "abstract": "Auction is widely applied in wireless communication for spectrum allocation. Most of prior works have assumed that spectrums are identical. In reality, however, spectrums provided by different owners have distinctive characteristics in both spacial and frequency domains. Spectrum availability also varies in different geo-locations. Furthermore, frequency diversity may cause non-identical conflicts among spectrum buyers since different frequencies have distinct communication ranges. Under such realistic scenario, existing spectrum auction schemes cannot provide truthfulness or efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Truthful double Auction for HEterogeneous Spectrum, called TAHES. TAHES allows buyers to explicitly express their personalized preferences for heterogeneous spectrums and also addresses the problem of interference graph variation. We prove that TAHES has nice economic properties including truthfulness, individual rationality and budget balance.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Xiaojun Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Xiaojun", "Yanjiao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yanjiao", "Jin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Jin", "Qian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Qian", "Bo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Bo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
