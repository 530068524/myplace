They have therefore not been available for application to Bayesian model determination, where the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically not fixed. This paper proposes a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump between parameter subspaces of differing dimensionality, which is flexible and entirely constructive. It should therefore have wide applicability in model determination problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point analysis in one and two dimensions, and to a Bayesian comparison of binomial experiments.", "citation": "Citations (5,998)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Stanford University", "University of London", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Paris", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Department of M ... l BS8 1TW, U.K."], "authors": ["Till Nowak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nowak:Till"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
