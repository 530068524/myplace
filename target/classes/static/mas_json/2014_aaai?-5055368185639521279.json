{"title": "Lifting Relational MAP-LPs Using Cluster Signatures.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "homogeneous space", "maximum a posteriori estimation", "automorphism", "graphical model"], "abstract": "Inference in large scale graphical models is an important task in many domains, and in particular probabilistic relational models (e.g. Markov logic networks). Such models often exhibit considerable symmetry, and it is a challenge to devise algorithms that exploit this symmetry to speed up inference. Recently, the automorphism group has been proposed to formalize mathematically what \"exploiting symmetry\" means.\n\nHowever, obtaining symmetry derived from automorphism is GI-hard, and consequently only a small fraction of the symmetry is easily available for effective employment. In this paper, we improve upon efficiency in two ways. First, we introduce the Cluster Signature Graph (CSG), a platform on which greater portions of the symmetries can be revealed and exploited. CSGs classify clusters of variables by projecting relations between cluster members onto a graph, allowing for the efficient pruning of symmetrical clusters even before their generation. Second, we introduce a novel framework based on CSGs for the Sherali-Adams hierarchy of linear program (LP) relaxations, dedicated to exploiting this symmetry for the benefit of tight Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approximations. Combined with the pruning power of CSG, the framework quickly generates compact formulations for otherwise intractable LPs, as demonstrated by several empirical results.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Technical University of Dortmund", "Technical University of Dortmund"], "authors": ["Udi Apsel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apsel:Udi", "Kristian Kersting.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kersting:Kristian", "Martin Mladenov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mladenov:Martin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
