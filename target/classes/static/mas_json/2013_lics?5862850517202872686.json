We develop a pumping lemma for HORS by using a novel but simple intersection type system for reasoning about reductions of lambda-terms. Our proof is arguably much simpler than the proof of Kartzow and Parys' pumping lemma for collapsible pushdown automata. As an application, we give an alternative proof of Kartzow and Parys' result about the strictness of the hierarchy of trees generated by HORS.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Naoki Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi_0001:Naoki"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
