In this work, we present a toolkit RaPiD for the reliability analysis of non-deterministic systems. Taking Markov decision process as reliability model, RaPiD can help in the analysis of three fundamental and rewarding aspects regarding software reliability. First, to have reliability assurance on a system, RaPiD can synthesize the overall system reliability given the reliability values of system components. Second, given a requirement on the overall system reliability, RaPiD can distribute the reliability requirement to each component. Lastly, RaPiD can identify the component that affects the system reliability most significantly. RaPiD has been applied to analyze several real-world systems including a financial stock trading system, a proton therapy control system and an ambient assisted living room system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Nanyang Technological University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Lin Gui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gui_0002:Lin", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Yang", "Truong Khanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Truong_Khanh", "Jin Song Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jin_Song"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
