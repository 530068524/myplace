To this end, we generate a summary by extracting a subset of sentences using the Cross-Entropy (CE) Method. The proposed approach is generic and requires no domain knowledge. Using an evaluation over DUC 2005-2007 datasets with several other state-of-the-art baseline methods, we demonstrate that, our approach is both effective and efficient.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Guy Feigenblat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feigenblat:Guy", "Haggai Roitman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roitman:Haggai", "Odellia Boni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boni:Odellia", "David Konopnicki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konopnicki:David"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
