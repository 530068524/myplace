The step of hypothesis regions (region proposals) localization in these existing multi-label image recognition pipelines, however, usually takes redundant computation cost, e.g., generating hundreds of meaningless proposals with non-discriminative information and extracting their features, and the spatial contextual dependency modeling among the localized regions are often ignored or over-simplified. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes a recurrent attention reinforcement learning framework to iteratively discover a sequence of attentional and informative regions that are related to different semantic objects and further predict label scores conditioned on these regions. Besides, our method explicitly models long-term dependencies among these attentional regions that help to capture semantic label co-occurrence and thus facilitate multi-label recognition. Extensive experiments and comparisons on two large-scale benchmarks (i.e., PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO) show that our model achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in both performance and efficiency as well as explicitly identifying image-level semantic labels to specific object regions.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Tianshui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Tianshui", "Zhouxia Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhouxia", "Guanbin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Guanbin", "Liang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Liang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
