Our system takes as input a sequence of monocular camera images as well as a stream of sparse range measurements as obtained from a laser or other sensor system. In contrast with existing approaches, we do not assume that the depth and color data streams have the same data rates or that the observed scene is fully static. Our method produces a dense, high-resolution depth map of the scene, automatically generating confidence values for every interpolated depth point. We describe how to integrate priors on object motion and appearance and how to achieve an efficient implementation using parallel processing hardware such as GPUs.", "citation": "Citations (139)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jennifer Dolson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dolson:Jennifer", "Jongmin Baek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baek:Jongmin", "Christian Plagemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plagemann:Christian", "Sebastian Thrun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thrun:Sebastian"], "pages": 8}
