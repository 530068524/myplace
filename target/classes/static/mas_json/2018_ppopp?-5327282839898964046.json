{"title": "Efficient shuffle management with SCache for DAG computing frameworks.", "fields": ["analytics", "spark", "parallel computing", "testbed", "heuristic"], "abstract": "In large-scale data-parallel analytics, shuffle, or the cross-network read and aggregation of partitioned data between tasks with data dependencies, usually brings in large overhead. To reduce shuffle overhead, we present  SCache , an open source plug-in system that particularly focuses on shuffle optimization. By extracting and analyzing shuffle dependencies prior to the actual task execution, SCache can adopt heuristic pre-scheduling combining with shuffle size prediction to pre-fetch shuffle data and balance load on each node. Meanwhile, SCache takes full advantage of the system memory to accelerate the shuffle process. We have implemented SCache and customized Spark to use it as the external shuffle service and co-scheduler. The performance of SCache is evaluated with both simulations and testbed experiments on a 50-node Amazon EC2 cluster. Those evaluations have demonstrated that, by incorporating SCache, the shuffle overhead of Spark can be reduced by nearly 89%, and the overall completion time of TPC-DS queries improves 40% on average.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Zhouwang Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Zhouwang", "Tao Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Tao", "Zhengwei Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Zhengwei", "Haibing Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Haibing"], "pages": 12}
