{"title": "On pairwise costs for network flow multi-object tracking.", "fields": ["rounding", "pairwise comparison", "clutter", "video tracking", "heuristic"], "abstract": "Multi-object tracking has been recently approached with the min-cost network flow optimization techniques. Such methods simultaneously resolve multiple object tracks in a video and enable modeling of dependencies among tracks. Min-cost network flow methods also fit well within the \u201ctracking-by-detection\u201d paradigm where object trajectories are obtained by connecting per-frame outputs of an object detector. Object detectors, however, often fail due to occlusions and clutter in the video. To cope with such situations, we propose to add pairwise costs to the min-cost network flow framework. While integer solutions to such a problem become NP-hard, we design a convex relaxation solution with an efficient rounding heuristic which empirically gives certificates of small suboptimality. We evaluate two particular types of pairwise costs and demonstrate improvements over recent tracking methods in real-world video sequences.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Visesh Chari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chari:Visesh", "Simon Lacoste-Julien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lacoste=Julien:Simon", "Ivan Laptev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laptev:Ivan", "Josef Sivic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sivic:Josef"], "pages": 9}
