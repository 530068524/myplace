Existing works on trajectory classification do not consider the duration information of trajectory. In this paper, we extract duration-aware features from trajectories to build a classifier. Our method utilizes information theory to obtain regions where the trajectories have similar speeds and directions. Further, trajectories are summarized into a network based on the MDL principle that takes into account the duration difference among trajectories of different classes. A graph traversal is performed on this trajectory network to obtain the top-k covering path rules for each trajectory. Based on the discovered regions and top-k path rules, we build a classifier to predict the class labels of new trajectories. Experiment results on real-world datasets show that the proposed duration-aware classifier can obtain higher classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art trajectory classifier.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Dhaval Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Dhaval", "Chang Sheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheng:Chang", "Wynne Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Wynne", "Mong-Li Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Mong=Li"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
