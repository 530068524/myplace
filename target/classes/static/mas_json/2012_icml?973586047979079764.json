Specifically, our algorithm uses Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the distribution of unlabeled examples selected by a sequential policy over k steps. The algorithm then selects k examples that best matches this distribution, leading to a combinatorial optimization problem that we term \"bounded coordinated matching\". While we show this problem is NP-hard, we give an efficient greedy solution, which inherits approximation bounds from supermodular minimization theory. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach is highly effective.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Williams College"], "authors": ["Javad Azimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azimi:Javad", "Alan Fern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fern:Alan", "Xiaoli Zhang Fern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fern:Xiaoli_Zhang", "Glencora Borradaile.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borradaile:Glencora", "Brent Heeringa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heeringa:Brent"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
