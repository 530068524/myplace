Though there have been a number of recent studies that demonstrate various utilities of network coding in the multi- session scenario, they rely on very restricted classes of codes in terms of the coding operations allowed and/or the location of decoding. In this paper, we propose a novel inter-session network coding strategy for a general connection problem. Our coding strategy allows fairly general random linear coding over a large finite field, in which decoding is done at receivers and the mixture of information at interior nodes is controlled by evolutionary mechanisms. We demonstrate how our coding strategy may surpass existing end-to-end pairwise XOR coding schemes in terms of effectiveness and practicality.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Minkyu Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Minkyu", "Muriel M\u00e9dard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=eacute=dard:Muriel", "Una-May O'Reilly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Reilly:Una=May", "Danail Traskov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traskov:Danail"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
