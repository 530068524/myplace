{"title": "Matching via Dimensionality Reduction for Estimation of Treatment Effects in Digital Marketing Campaigns.", "fields": ["average treatment effect", "covariate", "curse of dimensionality", "linear subspace", "estimator"], "abstract": "A widely used method for estimating counterfactuals and causal treatment effects from observational data is nearest-neighbor matching. This typically involves pairing each treated unit with its nearest-in-covariates control unit, and then estimating an average treatment effect from the set of matched pairs. Although straightforward to implement, this estimator is known to suffer from a bias that increases with the dimensionality of the covariate space, which can be undesirable in applications that involve high-dimensional data. To address this problem, we propose a novel estimator that first projects the data to a number of random linear subspaces, and it then estimates the median treatment effect by nearest-neighbor matching in each subspace. We empirically compute the mean square error of the proposed estimator using semi-synthetic data, and we demonstrate the method on real-world digital marketing campaign data. The results show marked improvement over baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Sheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Sheng", "Nikos Vlassis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vlassis:Nikos", "Jaya Kawale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawale:Jaya", "Yun Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu_0001:Yun"], "pages": 7}
