One factor contributing to these issues is building age. Residential buildings, for example, constitute 95% of all buildings in the US and are on average over 50 years old [23]; most of these buildings were constructed using energy inefficient designs and their materials have degraded over time. Moreover, the US Department of Energy has set a goal of reducing housing energy use by up to 70% [18]. To meet this goal, renovations and retrofits of existing building stock has become a pressing need. One effective practice for motivating these improvements is energy auditing, which has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years [20].", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Matthew Louis Mauriello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mauriello:Matthew_Louis"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
