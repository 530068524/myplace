To investigate this issue further we have conducted an analysis on a fascinating piece of machinery often referred to as one of the predecessors of the modern day computer, the Jacquard loom. In analysing the Jacquard loom we look at qualities in design and interaction from some different perspectives: how historical tools, crafts, and practices can inform interaction design, the role of physicality, materiality, and full-body interaction in order to rethink some current conceptions of interaction and design of computational devices.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University", "Stockholm University"], "authors": ["Ylva Fernaeus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fernaeus:Ylva", "Martin Jonsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jonsson:Martin", "Jakob Tholander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tholander:Jakob"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
