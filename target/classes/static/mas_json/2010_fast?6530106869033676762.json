{"title": "Black-Box Problem Diagnosis in Parallel File Systems.", "fields": ["black box", "file system", "device file", "self certifying file system", "file system fragmentation"], "abstract": "We focus on automatically diagnosing different performance problems in parallel file systems by identifying, gathering and analyzing OS-level, black-box performance metrics on every node in the cluster. Our peer-comparison diagnosis approach compares the statistical attributes of these metrics across I/O servers, to identify the faulty node. We develop a root-cause analysis procedure that further analyzes the affected metrics to pinpoint the faulty resource (storage or network), and demonstrate that this approach works commonly across stripe-based parallel file systems. We demonstrate our approach for realistic storage and network problems injected into three different file-system benchmarks (dd, IOzone, and Post-Mark), in both PVFS and Lustre clusters.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "DSO National Laboratories", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Michael P.
