An efficient fleet management strategy not only can significantly improve the utilization of transportation resources but also increase the revenue and customer satisfaction. It is a challenging task to design an effective fleet management strategy that can adapt to an environment involving complex dynamics between demand and supply. Existing studies usually work on a simplified problem setting that can hardly capture the complicated stochastic demand-supply variations in high-dimensional space. In this paper we propose to tackle the large-scale fleet management problem using reinforcement learning, and propose a contextual multi-agent reinforcement learning framework including two concrete algorithms, namely contextual deep Q-learning and contextual multi-agent actor-critic, to achieve explicit coordination among a large number of agents adaptive to different contexts. We show significant improvements of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art approaches through extensive empirical studies.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Didi Chuxing, Beijing, China", "Didi Chuxing, Beijing, China"], "authors": ["Kaixiang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Kaixiang", "Renyu Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Renyu", "Zhe Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zhe", "Jiayu Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Jiayu"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
