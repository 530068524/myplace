In general, the ranking of n objects can be identified by standard sorting methods using n log2 n pairwise comparisons. We are interested in natural situations in which relationships among the objects may allow for ranking using far fewer pairwise comparisons. Specifically, we assume that the objects can be embedded into a d-dimensional Euclidean space and that the rankings reflect their relative distances from a common reference point in \u211dd. We show that under this assumption the number of possible rankings grows like n2d and demonstrate an algorithm that can identify a randomly selected ranking using just slightly more than d log n adaptively selected pairwise comparisons, on average. If instead the comparisons are chosen at random, then almost all pairwise comparisons must be made in order to identify any ranking. In addition, we propose a robust, error-tolerant algorithm that only requires that the pairwise comparisons are probably correct. Experimental studies with synthetic and real datasets support the conclusions of our theoretical analysis.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Kevin G.
