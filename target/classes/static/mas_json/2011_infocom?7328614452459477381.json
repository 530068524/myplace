{"title": "A comparative performance analysis of IP traffic offloading schemes over Dynamic Circuits.", "fields": ["multiprotocol label switching", "loose source routing", "internet traffic", "ip forwarding", "virtual routing and forwarding"], "abstract": "We present an novel analytical framework for modeling current IP offloading schemes and show their comparative performance. We analyze relevant parameters, including IP routing re-convergence time, the number of affected IP routes, and the cost of circuit capacity used for offloading. Our results show that emerging offloading solutions based on invisible bypasses can better maintain network stability and reduce the routing reconfiguration effort compared to the traditional traffic engineering approaches that modify the IP routing.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Technische Univ ... chweig, Germany", "Technische Univ ... chweig, Germany", "Technische Univ ... chweig, Germany"], "authors": ["Mohit Chamania.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chamania:Mohit", "Marcel Caria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caria:Marcel", "Admela Jukan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jukan:Admela"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
