{"title": "Linear combinations of unordered data vectors.", "fields": ["countable set", "monoid", "linear independence", "commutative property", "linear combination"], "abstract": "Data vectors generalise finite multisets: they are finitely supported functions into a commutative monoid. We study the question whether a given data vector can be expressed as a finite sum of others, only assuming that 1) the domain is countable and 2) the given set of base vectors is finite up to permutations of the domain.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Bordeaux", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Piotr Hofman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofman:Piotr", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Leroux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leroux:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Patrick Totzke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Totzke:Patrick"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
