A state-of-the-art approach for this problem is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We propose a particular transition probability between latent road segments by the use of the number of turns in addition to the travel distance between the latent road segments. We use inverse reinforcement learning to estimate the importance of the number of turns relative to the travel distance. This estimated importance is incorporated in the transition probability of the HMM. We show, through numerical experiments, that the error of map-matching can be reduced substantially with the proposed transition probability.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Takayuki Osogami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osogami:Takayuki", "Rudy Raymond.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raymond:Rudy"], "pages": 7}
