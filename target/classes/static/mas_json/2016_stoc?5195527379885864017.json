We consider the case where the parties have inputs that are independent of each other, and give a simulation protocol that communicates I^2 * polylog(I) bits, where I is the information cost of the original protocol. Our protocol is the first simulation protocol whose communication complexity is bounded by a polynomial in the information cost of the original protocol.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Princeton University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Gillat Kol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kol:Gillat"], "pages": 12}
