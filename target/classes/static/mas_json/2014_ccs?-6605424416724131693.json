{"title": "Decide Now or Decide Later?: Quantifying the Tradeoff between Prospective and Retrospective Access Decisions.", "fields": ["insider threat", "audit", "cost estimate", "receiver operating characteristic", "access control"], "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges an organization faces is determining when an employee is permitted to utilize a certain resource in a system. This \"insider threat\" can be addressed through two strategies: i) prospective methods, such as access control, that make a decision at the time of a request, and ii) retrospective methods, such as post hoc auditing, that make a decision in the light of the knowledge gathered afterwards. While it is recognized that each strategy has a distinct set of benefits and drawbacks, there has been little investigation into how to provide system administrators with practical guidance on when one or the other should be applied. To address this problem, we introduce a framework to compare these strategies on a common quantitative scale. In doing so, we translate these strategies into classification problems using a context-based feature space that assesses the likelihood that an access request is legitimate. We then introduce a technique called bispective analysis to compare the performance of the classification models under the situation of non-equivalent costs for false positive and negative instances, a significant extension on traditional cost analysis techniques, such as analysis of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. Using domain-specific cost estimates and access logs of several months from a large Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, we demonstrate how bispective analysis can support meaningful decisions about the relative merits of prospective and retrospective decision making for specific types of hospital personnel.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Vanderbilt University", "Vanderbilt University", "Northwestern University", "Vanderbilt University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Wen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wen", "You Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:You", "Thaddeus Cybulski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cybulski:Thaddeus", "Daniel Fabbri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fabbri:Daniel", "Carl A.
