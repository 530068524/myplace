{"title": "In the Flow, Being Heard, and Having Opportunities: Sources of Power and Power Dynamics in Global Teams.", "fields": ["flow", "information flow", "feeling", "computer supported cooperative work", "qualitative research"], "abstract": "In our qualitative study of 9 globally distributed software development teams, we found that power and how it was distributed across locations had a significant effect on team dynamics. We describe the sources of power for these teams, which include being in the flow of information, feeling that one's voice is heard by decision makers, and having opportunities for career growth and advancement. We also examine power dynamics across locations by team and show that having more balanced power was typically associated with more power struggles rather than fewer. Four of the 9 teams had ongoing power contests. Each of these teams had some sources of power at one location and other sources of power at the other location. Both sites worried about losing power, felt they should have more, and struggled against losing ground. We conclude with a discussion of the need for CSCW to expand beyond collaboration to address issues of power. We propose ideas for systems to support globally distributed teams in creating more equal access to more sources of power and alleviating unhealthy power dynamics.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "George Mason University"], "authors": ["Pamela J.
