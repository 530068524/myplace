Aiming to automatic representative photo selection, we develop three feature classification methods, i.e., point-based, region-based, and pLSA-based classification, to differentiate local feature points described by SIFT descriptors. We investigate the performance of these classification methods, and discuss how they influence near-duplicate detection and extended applications. Experiments show that, with effective feature classification, more accurate representative selection results can be achieved.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["National Chung Cheng University", "National Chung Cheng University", "Industrial Technology Research Institute"], "authors": ["Wei-Ta Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Wei=Ta", "Chia-Hung Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chia=Hung", "Jen-Yu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jen=Yu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
