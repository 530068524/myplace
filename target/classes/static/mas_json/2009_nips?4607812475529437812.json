Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability. Unfortunately, l1-norm MKL is hardly observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures, we generalize MKL to arbitrary lp-norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efficient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary p > 1. Empirically, we demonstrate that the interleaved optimization strategies are much faster compared to the traditionally used wrapper approaches. Finally, we apply lp-norm MKL to real-world problems from computational biology, showing that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that go beyond the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (276)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Yahoo!", "University of T\u00fcbingen", "Technical University of Berlin", "LIFE Biosystems ... lberg, Germany"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Marius Kloft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kloft:Marius", "Ulf Brefeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brefeld:Ulf", "S\u00f6ren Sonnenburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sonnenburg:S=ouml=ren", "Pavel Laskov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laskov:Pavel", "Klaus-Robert M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Klaus=Robert", "Alexander Zien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zien:Alexander"], "pages": 9}
