While public clouds offer elastic, on-demand resource provisioning and pay-as-you-go pricing, individual users setting up their on-demand virtual clusters may not be able to take full advantage of common cost-saving opportunities, such as reserved instances.   In this paper, we propose a  Semi-Elastic Cluster  (SEC) computing model for organizations to reserve and dynamically resize a virtual cloud-based cluster. We present a set of integrated batch scheduling plus resource scaling strategies uniquely enabled by SEC, as well as an online reserved instance provisioning algorithm based on job history. Our trace-driven simulation results show that such a model has a 61.0% cost saving than individual users acquiring and managing cloud resources without causing longer average job wait time. Meanwhile, the overhead of acquiring/maintaining shared cloud instances is shown to take only a few seconds.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "North Carolina State University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Shuangcheng Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Shuangcheng", "Jidong Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Jidong", "Xiaosong Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiaosong", "Xiongchao Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiongchao", "Wenguang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wenguang"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
