BM 3 N generalizes extant structured prediction rules based on point estimator to a Bayes-predictor using a learnt distribution of rules. We present a novel  Structured Maximum Entropy Discrimination  (SMED) formalism for combining Bayesian and max-margin learning of Markov networks for structured prediction, and our approach subsumes the conventional M 3 N as a special case. An efficient learning algorithm based on variational inference and standard convex-optimization solvers for M 3 N, and a generalization bound are offered. Our method outperforms competing ones on both synthetic and real OCR data.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Eric P.
