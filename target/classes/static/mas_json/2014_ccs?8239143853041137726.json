{"title": "From Patches to Honey-Patches: Lightweight Attacker Misdirection, Deception, and Disinformation.", "fields": ["disinformation", "decoy", "exploit", "honeypot", "software security assurance"], "abstract": "Traditional software security patches often have the unfortunate side-effect of quickly alerting attackers that their attempts to exploit patched vulnerabilities have failed. Attackers greatly benefit from this information; it expedites their search for unpatched vulnerabilities, it allows them to reserve their ultimate attack payloads for successful attacks, and it increases attacker confidence in stolen secrets or expected sabotage resulting from attacks. To overcome this disadvantage, a methodology is proposed for reformulating a broad class of security patches into honey-patches - patches that offer equivalent security but that frustrate attackers' ability to determine whether their attacks have succeeded or failed. When an exploit attempt is detected, the honey-patch transparently and efficiently redirects the attacker to an unpatched decoy, where the attack is allowed to succeed. The decoy may host aggressive software monitors that collect important attack information, and deceptive files that disinform attackers. An implementation for three production-level web servers, including Apache HTTP, demonstrates that honey-patching can be realized for large-scale, performance-critical software applications with minimal overheads.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Frederico Araujo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Araujo:Frederico", "Kevin W.
