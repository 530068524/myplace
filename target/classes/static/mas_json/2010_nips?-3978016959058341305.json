{"title": "Practical Large-Scale Optimization for Max-norm Regularization.", "fields": ["optimization problem", "regularization", "cut", "factorization", "collaborative filtering"], "abstract": "The max-norm was proposed as a convex matrix regularizer in [1] and was shown to be empirically superior to the trace-norm for collaborative filtering problems. Although the max-norm can be computed in polynomial time, there are currently no practical algorithms for solving large-scale optimization problems that incorporate the max-norm. The present work uses a factorization technique of Burer and Monteiro [2] to devise scalable first-order algorithms for convex programs involving the max-norm. These algorithms are applied to solve huge collaborative filtering, graph cut, and clustering problems. Empirically, the new methods outperform mature techniques from all three areas.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "California Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of W ... sconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Jason D.
