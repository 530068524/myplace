The network is divided into sub-areas according to the location of the generation units and the mutual information (MI) between the states of interest and the available measurements. The proposed decentralized state estimation scheme only relies on local information and on a limited amount of information from neighboring areas. In each area, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to estimate the loads consumptions. The proposed approach is tested using a modified IEEE 34-node test feeder. The effectiveness of the method is validated on a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation platform. To evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed decentralized approach we compared the results obtained to a centralized and a totally local approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of South Carolina", "University of South Carolina", "University of South Carolina", "Cranfield University", "Cranfield University", "Shanghai University", "Shanghai University", "Shanghai University", "Shanghai University", "Yanshan University", "Yanshan University", "Yanshan University", "Yanshan University", "Shanghai Normal University", "Shanghai Normal University", "Aristotle Unive ... neering, Greece", "Aristotle Unive ... neering, Greece", "Earthquake Admi ... hanghai, China", "Beijing Unisoun ...
