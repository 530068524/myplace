Specifically, for an arbitrary N distinct points in Sp-1, our goal is to encode each point using m-dimensional binary strings such that we can reconstruct their geodesic distance up to \u03b4 uniform distortion. Existing binary embedding algorithms either lack theoretical guarantees or suffer from running time O(mp). We make three contributions: (1) we establish a lower bound that shows any binary embedding oblivious to the set of points requires m = \u03a9(1/\u03b42log N) bits and a similar lower bound for non-oblivious embeddings into Hamming distance; (2) we propose a novel fast binary embedding algorithm with provably optimal bit complexity m = \u03a9(1/\u03b42log N) and near linear running time O(p log p) whenever log N \u226a \u03b4 \u221ap with a slightly worse running time for larger log N; (3) we also provide an analytic result about embedding a general set of points K \u2286 Sp-1 with even infinite size. Our theoretical findings are supported through experiments on both synthetic and real data sets.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Xinyang Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Xinyang", "Constantine Caramanis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caramanis:Constantine", "Eric Price.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Price:Eric"], "pages": 9}
