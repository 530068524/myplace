We provide explicit measurement constructions for several special graphs. A general measurement construction algorithm is also proposed and evaluated. For any given graph G with n nodes, we derive order optimal upper bounds of the minimum number of measurements needed to recover any k-sparse vector over G (M k,n  G ). Our study suggests that M k,n  G  may serve as a graph connectivity metric.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Meng", "Weiyu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Weiyu", "Enrique Mallada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mallada:Enrique", "Ao Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Ao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
