{"title": "Discriminative Pronunciation Modeling: A Large-Margin, Feature-Rich Approach.", "fields": ["phonetic transcription", "generative grammar", "discriminative model", "conditional random field", "speech corpus"], "abstract": "We address the problem of learning the mapping between words and their possible pronunciations in terms of sub-word units. Most previous approaches have involved generative modeling of the distribution of pronunciations, usually trained to maximize likelihood. We propose a discriminative, feature-rich approach using large-margin learning. This approach allows us to optimize an objective closely related to a discriminative task, to incorporate a large number of complex features, and still do inference efficiently. We test the approach on the task of lexical access; that is, the prediction of a word given a phonetic transcription. In experiments on a subset of the Switchboard conversational speech corpus, our models thus far improve classification error rates from a previously published result of 29.1% to about 15%. We find that large-margin approaches outperform conditional random field learning, and that the Passive-Aggressive algorithm for large-margin learning is faster to converge than the Pegasos algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hao Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0002:Hao", "Joseph Keshet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keshet:Joseph", "Karen Livescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Livescu:Karen"], "pages": 10}
