Given an initial query, these query suggestions should provide a coverage of possible subtasks the user might be looking for. We propose a probabilistic modeling framework that obtains keyphrases from multiple sources and generates query suggestions from these keyphrases. Using the test suites of the TREC Tasks track, we evaluate and analyze each component of our model.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Stavanger", "University of Stavanger"], "authors": ["Dar\u00edo Garigliotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garigliotti:Dar=iacute=o", "Krisztian Balog.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balog:Krisztian"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
