A basic approach is template matching on parse trees. The proposed method improves on this approach in two ways. To improve recall, irregularities in parse trees caused by verb form errors are taken into account; to improve precision, n-gram counts are utilized to filter proposed corrections. Evaluation on non-native corpora, representing two genres and mother tongues, shows promising results.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["John Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:John", "Stephanie Seneff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seneff:Stephanie"], "pages": 9}
