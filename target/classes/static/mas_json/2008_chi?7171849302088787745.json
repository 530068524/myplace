{"title": "Celebratory technology: new directions for food research in HCI.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "domestic technology", "computer science"], "abstract": "Food is a central part of our lives. Fundamentally, we need food to survive. Socially, food is something that brings people together-individuals interact through and around it. Culturally, food practices reflect our ethnicities and nationalities. Given the importance of food in our daily lives, it is important to understand what role technology currently plays and the roles it can be imagined to play in the future. In this paper we describe the existing and potential design space for HCI in the area of human-food interaction. We present ideas for future work on designing technologies in the area of human-food interaction that celebrate the positive interactions that people have with food as they eat and prepare foods in their everyday lives.", "citation": "Citations (189)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Georgia Institu ... tlanta, GA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Andrea Grimes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grimes:Andrea", "Richard Harper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harper_0001:Richard"], "pages": 10}
