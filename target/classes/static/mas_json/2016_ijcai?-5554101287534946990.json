{"title": "From One Point to a Manifold: Knowledge Graph Embedding for Precise Link Prediction.", "fields": ["manifold", "algebraic number", "graph embedding", "vector space", "embedding"], "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding aims at offering a numerical knowledge representation paradigm by transforming the entities and relations into continuous vector space. However, existing methods could not characterize the knowledge graph in a fine degree to make a precise link prediction. There are two reasons for this issue: being an ill-posed algebraic system and adopting an overstrict geometric form. As precise link prediction is critical for knowledge graph embedding, we propose a manifold-based embedding principle (ManifoldE) which could be treated as a well-posed algebraic system that expands point-wise modeling in current models to manifold-wise modeling. Extensive experiments show that the proposed models achieve substantial improvements against the state-of-the-art baselines, particularly for the precise prediction task, and yet maintain high efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Han Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao_0005:Han", "Minlie Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Minlie", "Xiaoyan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaoyan"], "pages": 7}
