The Dichotomy Conjecture for the non-uniform CSP states that for every constraint language \\Gm the problem CSP(\u0393) is either solvable in polynomial time or is NP-complete. It was proposed by Feder and Vardi in their seminal 1993 paper. In this paper we confirm the Dichotomy Conjecture.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Andrei A.
