However, there are few modeling tools that take full advantage of the devices. This paper discusses a Web based UML modeling tool with touch screens, based on our full analysis of human-machine interaction modes for software modeling. The tool provides more input means, i.e. combining gesture input and traditional keyboard and mouse input, and supports cross-platforms modeling by using HTML 5.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Zhiyi Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Zhiyi", "Chih-Yi Yeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeh:Chih=Yi", "Huihong He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Huihong", "Hongjie Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hongjie"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
