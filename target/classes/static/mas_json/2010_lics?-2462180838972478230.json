{"title": "A Generic Operational Metatheory for Algebraic Effects.", "fields": ["preorder", "extensionality", "parametricity", "specialization pre order", "operational semantics"], "abstract": "We provide a syntactic analysis of contextual preorder and equivalence for a polymorphic programming language with effects. Our approach applies uniformly across a range of {algebraic effects}, and incorporates, as instances: errors, input/output, global state, nondeterminism, probabilistic choice, and combinations thereof. Our approach is to extend Plotkin and Power's structural operational semantics for algebraic effects (FoSSaCS 2001) with a primitive \"basic preorder\" on ground type computation trees. The basic preorder is used to derive notions of contextual preorder and equivalence on program terms. Under mild assumptions on this relation, we prove fundamental properties of contextual preorder (hence equivalence) including extensionality properties and a characterisation via applicative contexts, and we provide machinery for reasoning about polymorphism using relational parametricity.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Strathclyde", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Bonn"], "authors": ["Patricia Johann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johann:Patricia", "Alex Simpson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simpson:Alex", "Janis Voigtl\u00e4nder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voigtl=auml=nder:Janis"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
