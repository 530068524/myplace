This poses new challenges, and we believe that if not well provisioned, such capability may even degrade network performance. Among the challenges, we are interested in how the in-network caching capability should be best provisioned to improve the overall network performance. To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative caching scheme guided by traffic engineering (TECC) for the emerging content-centric networks. In particular, we decouple collaborative in-network caching and traffic engineering via the primal-dual decomposition. Our evaluations, although preliminary, suggest that the improvement is as much as 80% compared to collaborative caching without guidance of traffic engineering.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei"], "authors": ["Haiyong Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Haiyong", "Guangyu Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Guangyu", "Pengwei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Pengwei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
