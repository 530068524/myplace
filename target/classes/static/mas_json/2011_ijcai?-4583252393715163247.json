{"title": "A Computationally-Grounded Semantics for Artifact-Centric Systems and Abstraction Results.", "fields": ["well founded semantics", "failure semantics", "service oriented architecture", "operational semantics", "abstraction model checking"], "abstract": "We present a formal investigation of artifact-based systems, a relatively novel framework in service oriented computing, aimed at laying the foundations for verifying these systems through model checking. We present an infinite-state, computationally grounded semantics for these systems that allows us to reason about temporal-epistemic specifications. We present abstraction techniques for the semantics that guarantee transfer of satisfaction from the abstract system to the concrete one.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Francesco Belardinelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belardinelli:Francesco", "Alessio Lomuscio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lomuscio:Alessio", "Fabio Patrizi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patrizi:Fabio"], "pages": 6}
