{"title": "The Multi-Inter-Distance Constraint.", "fields": ["local consistency", "job shop scheduling", "constraint logic programming", "binary constraint", "hybrid algorithm"], "abstract": "We introduce the MULTI-INTER-DISTANCE constraint that ensures no more than m variables are assigned to values lying in a window of p consecutive values. This constraint is useful for modeling scheduling problems where tasks of processing time p compete for m identical resources. We present a propagator that achieves bounds consistency in cubic time. Experiments show that this new constraint offers a much stronger filtering than an edge-finder and that it allows to solve larger instances of the runway scheduling problem.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Laval University", "Laval University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Pierre Ouellet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouellet:Pierre", "Claude-Guy Quimper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quimper:Claude=Guy"], "pages": 6}
