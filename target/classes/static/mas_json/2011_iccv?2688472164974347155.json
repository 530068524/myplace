In contrast with previous work which uses either direct or iterative methods as the linear solver, GSP combines their advantages and is significantly faster on large datasets. Similar to [11], the main idea is to identify a sub-problem (subgraph) that can be solved efficiently by sparse factorization methods and use it to build a preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method. The difference is that GSP is more general and leads to much more effective preconditioners. We design a greedy algorithm to build subgraphs which have bounded maximum clique size in the factorization phase, and also result in smaller condition numbers than standard preconditioning techniques. When applying the proposed method to the \u201cbal\u201d datasets [1], GSP displays promising performance.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yong-Dian Jian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jian:Yong=Dian", "Doru-Cristian Balcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balcan:Doru=Cristian", "Frank Dellaert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dellaert:Frank"], "pages": 8}
