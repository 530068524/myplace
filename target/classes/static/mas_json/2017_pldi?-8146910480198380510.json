{"title": "BigFoot: static check placement for dynamic race detection.", "fields": ["fold", "shadow", "correctness", "heap", "static analysis"], "abstract": "Precise dynamic data race detectors provide strong correctness guarantees but have high overheads because they generally keep analysis state in a separate shadow location for each heap memory location, and they check (and potentially update) the corresponding shadow location on each heap access. The BigFoot dynamic data race detector uses a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to coalesce checks and compress shadow locations. With BigFoot, multiple accesses to an object or array often induce a single coalesced check that manipulates a single compressed shadow location, resulting in a performance improvement over FastTrack of 61%.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Williams College"], "authors": ["Dustin Rhodes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rhodes:Dustin", "Cormac Flanagan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flanagan:Cormac", "Stephen N.
