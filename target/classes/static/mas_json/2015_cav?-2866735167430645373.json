{"title": "Time-Aware Abstractions in HybridSal.", "fields": ["bounded function", "abstraction", "expression", "model checking", "transition system"], "abstract": "HybridSal is a tool for enabling verification of hybrid systems using infinite bounded model checking and k-induction. The core component of the tool is an abstraction engine that automatically creates a discrete, but infinite, state transition system abstraction of the continuous dynamics in the system. In this paper, we describe HybridSal\u2019s new capability to create time-aware relational abstractions, which gives users control over the precision of the abstraction. We also describe a novel approach for abstracting nonlinear expressions that allows us to create time-aware relational abstractions that are more precise than those described previously. We show that the new approach enables automatic verification of systems that could not be verified previously.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["SRI International"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ashish Tiwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwari:Ashish"], "pages": 7}
