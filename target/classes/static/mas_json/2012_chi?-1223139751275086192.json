This note presents a case study of rapid distributed brainstorming for disaster response, involving 275 contributors from 23 countries within a three-day period, conducted among the staff in a multinational company. Factors that appear to have contributed to the success of this brainstorming include: Social media that could be easily appropriated; and employee familiarity with large-scale brainstorming. The formation of this \"flash-community\" joins other CHI reports to point toward a new genre of rapid large-scale responses to disasters through social media.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Michael Muller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muller:Michael", "Sacha Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Sacha"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
