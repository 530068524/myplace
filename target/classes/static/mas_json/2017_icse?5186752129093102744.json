{"title": "Exploring API embedding for API usages and applications.", "fields": ["source code", "word2vec", "embedding", "simple api for xml", "java"], "abstract": "Word2Vec is a class of neural network models that as being trained from a large corpus of texts, they can produce for each unique word a corresponding vector in a continuous space in which linguistic contexts of words can be observed. In this work, we study the characteristics of Word2Vec vectors, called  api 2 vec  or  API embeddings , for the API elements within the API sequences in source code. Our empirical study shows that the close proximity of the  api 2 vec  vectors for API elements reflects the similar usage contexts containing the surrounding APIs of those API elements. Moreover,  api 2 vec  can capture several similar semantic relations between API elements in API usages via vector offsets. We demonstrate the usefulness of  api 2 vec  vectors for API elements in three applications. First, we build a tool that mines the pairs of API elements that share the same usage relations among them. The other applications are in the code migration domain. We develop  api 2 api , a tool to automatically learn the API mappings between Java and C# using a characteristic of the  api 2 vec  vectors for API elements in the two languages: semantic relations among API elements in their usages are observed in the two vector spaces for the two languages as similar geometric arrangements among their  api 2 vec  vectors. Our empirical evaluation shows that  api 2 api  relatively improves 22.6% and 40.1% top-1 and top-5 accuracy over a state-of-the-art mining approach for API mappings. Finally, as another application in code migration, we are able to migrate equivalent API usages from Java to C# with up to 90.6% recall and 87.2% precision.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Trong Duc Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Trong_Duc", "Anh Tuan Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen_0001:Anh_Tuan", "Hung Dang Phan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phan:Hung_Dang", "Tien N.
