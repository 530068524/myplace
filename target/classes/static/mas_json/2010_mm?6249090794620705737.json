{"title": "An open-source SIFTLibrary.", "fields": ["invariant", "executable", "scale invariant feature transform", "computer vision", "feature"], "abstract": "Recent years have seen an explosion in the use of invariant keypoint methods across nearly every area of computer vision research. Since its introduction, the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) has been one of the most effective and widely-used of these methods and has served as a major catalyst in their popularization. In this paper, I present an open-source SIFT library, implemented in C and freely available at http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/~hess/sift.html, and I briefly compare its performance with that of the original SIFT executable released by David Lowe.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Rob Hess.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hess:Rob"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
