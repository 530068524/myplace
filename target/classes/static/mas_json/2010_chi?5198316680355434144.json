However, these applications are in their infancy, and we do not yet know what design factors will contribute to their success. For this reason, we have studied the well-established location-based experience of geocaching. We report on the results of a survey of geocachers along with observations from our own in-depth geocaching activities. Our findings illustrate that geocaching permits users to create a range of experiences for others within a permeable yet restricted culture of norms. Once created, geocaches are maintained by the community of geocachers through a well-designed groupware system. Here maintenance acts can be performed \"in the small,\" given their lightweight and well-defined nature, and become less about maintenance and more about personal participation. These findings provide insight into how community and groupware can be leveraged to support applications for location-based experiences.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of British Columbia", "Virginia Tech"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Carman Neustaedter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neustaedter:Carman", "Anthony Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Anthony", "Tejinder K.
