{"title": "Measuring the latency of cloud gaming systems.", "fields": ["upgrade", "cloud gaming", "lag", "thin client", "provisioning"], "abstract": "Cloud gaming, i.e., real-time game playing via thin clients, relieves players from the need to constantly upgrade their computers and deal with compatibility issues when playing games. As a result, cloud gaming is generating a great deal of interest among entrepreneurs and the public. However, given the large design space, it is not yet known which platforms deliver the best quality of service and which design elements constitute a good cloud gaming system.   This study is motivated by the question: How good is the real-timeliness of current cloud gaming systems? To address the question, we analyze the response latency of two cloud gaming platforms, namely, OnLive and StreamMyGame. Our results show that the streaming latency of OnLive is reasonable for real-time cloud gaming, while that of StreamMyGame is almost twice the former when the StreamMyGame server is provisioned using an Intel Core i7-920 PC. We believe that our measurement approach can be generally applied to PC-based cloud gaming platforms, and that it will further the understanding of such systems and lead to improvements.", "citation": "Citations (158)", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "National Taiwan University", "Academia Sinica", "National Taiwan Ocean University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Kuan-Ta Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Kuan=Ta", "Yu-Chun Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yu=Chun", "Po-Han Tseng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tseng:Po=Han", "Chun-Ying Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chun=Ying", "Chin-Laung Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Chin=Laung"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
