We show how complex preference relations can be specified through user-defined preference types and their arguments. We describe how preference specifications are handled internally by so-called preference programs, which are used for dominance testing. We also give algorithms for computing one, or all, optimal stable models of a logic program. Notably, our algorithms depend on the complexity of the dominance tests and make use of multi-shot answer set solving technology.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Leipzig University", "Simon Fraser University", "Universit\u00e4t Pot ... tsdam, Germany", "Universit\u00e4t Pot ... tsdam, Germany"], "authors": ["Gerhard Brewka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brewka:Gerhard", "James P.
