This is the first Software Defined Radio (SDR) based OFDM receiver supporting channel bandwidths up to 20MHz that is not relying on additional FPGA code. Our receiver comprises all layers from the physical up to decoding the MAC packet and extracting the payload of IEEE 802.11a/g/p frames. In our demonstration, visitors can interact live with the receiver while it is decoding frames that are sent over the air. The impact of moving the antennas and changing the settings are displayed live in time and frequency domain. Furthermore, the decoded frames are fed to Wireshark where the WiFi traffic can be further investigated. It is possible to access and visualize the data in every decoding step from the raw samples, the autocorrelation used for frame detection, the subcarriers before and after equalization, up to the decoded MAC packets. The receiver is completely Open Source and represents one step towards experimental research with SDR.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Innsbruck", "University of Innsbruck", "University of Innsbruck", "University of Innsbruck"], "authors": ["Bastian Bloessl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bloessl:Bastian", "Michele Segata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segata:Michele", "Christoph Sommer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sommer_0001:Christoph", "Falko Dressler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dressler:Falko"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
