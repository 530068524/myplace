This paper presents a novel nonmyopic e-Bayes-optimal active learning (e-BAL) approach that jointly and naturally optimizes the trade-off. In contrast, existing works have primarily developed myopic/greedy algorithms or performed exploration and exploitation separately. To perform active learning in real time, we then propose an anytime algorithm based on e-BAL with performance guarantee and empirically demonstrate using synthetic and real-world datasets that, with limited budget, it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Trong Nghia Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Trong_Nghia", "Bryan Kian Hsiang Low.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Low:Bryan_Kian_Hsiang", "Patrick Jaillet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaillet:Patrick", "Mohan S.
