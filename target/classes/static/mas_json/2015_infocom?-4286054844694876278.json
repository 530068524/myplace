Given a set of mobile sensors and their initial positions, how to move these sensors to a region border to achieve barrier coverage energy-efficiently is challenging. In this paper, we study the 2-D MinMax barrier coverage problem of moving n sensors in a two-dimensional plane to form a barrier coverage of a specified line segment in the plane while minimizing the maximum sensor movement for the sake of balancing battery power consumption. Previously, this problem was shown to be NP-hard for the general case. It was an open problem whether the problem is polynomial-time solvable for the case when sensors have a fixed number of sensing ranges. We study a special case of great practical significance that the sensors have the same sensing range and present an O(n 3  log n) time algorithm. Our algorithm computes a permutation of the left and right endpoints of the moving ranges of all the sensors forming a barrier coverage and minimizes the maximum sensor movement distance by characterizing permutation switches that are critical. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for solving the 2-D MinMax barrier coverage problem for the case that all sensors have a uniform sensing range.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Shuangjuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shuangjuan", "Hong Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen_0001:Hong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
