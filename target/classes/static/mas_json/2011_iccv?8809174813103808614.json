{"title": "BRISK: Binary Robust invariant scalable keypoints.", "fields": ["invariant", "scale space", "freak", "scale invariant feature transform", "scalability"], "abstract": "Effective and efficient generation of keypoints from an image is a well-studied problem in the literature and forms the basis of numerous Computer Vision applications. Established leaders in the field are the SIFT and SURF algorithms which exhibit great performance under a variety of image transformations, with SURF in particular considered as the most computationally efficient amongst the high-performance methods to date. In this paper we propose BRISK 1 , a novel method for keypoint detection, description and matching. A comprehensive evaluation on benchmark datasets reveals BRISK's adaptive, high quality performance as in state-of-the-art algorithms, albeit at a dramatically lower computational cost (an order of magnitude faster than SURF in cases). The key to speed lies in the application of a novel scale-space FAST-based detector in combination with the assembly of a bit-string descriptor from intensity comparisons retrieved by dedicated sampling of each keypoint neighborhood.", "citation": "Citations (2,382)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Stefan Leutenegger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leutenegger:Stefan", "Margarita Chli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chli:Margarita", "Roland Siegwart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siegwart:Roland"], "pages": 8}
