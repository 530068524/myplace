The proposed framework is based on an idea that object staleness can be better leveraged in regard to similarity of objects; i.e., an object is more likely to have leaked if it shows significantly high staleness not observed from other similar objects with the same allocation context.     A central part of the proposed framework is the modeling of heap objects. To this end, the framework observes the staleness of objects during a representative run of an application. From the observed data, the framework generates training examples, which also contain instances of hypothetical leaks. Via machine learning, the proposed framework replaces the error-prone user-definable staleness predicates used in previous research with a model-based prediction.     The framework was tested using both synthetic and real-world examples. Evaluation with synthetic leakage workloads of SPEC2006 benchmarks shows that the proposed method achieves the optimal accuracy permitted by staleness-based leak detection. Moreover, by incorporating allocation context into the model, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy than is possible with object staleness alone. Evaluation with real-world memory leaks demonstrates that the proposed method is effective for detecting previously reported bugs with high accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Virginia Tech", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sangho Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sangho", "Changhee Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Changhee", "Santosh Pande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pande:Santosh"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
