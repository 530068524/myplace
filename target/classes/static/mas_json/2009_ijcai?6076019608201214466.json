We provide empirical evidence that QBFs which cannot be solved by search or resolution alone, can be solved by combining them, and that our approach makes a proof-of-concept implementation competitive with current QBF solvers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Genoa", "University of Genoa"], "authors": ["Luca Pulina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pulina:Luca", "Armando Tacchella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tacchella:Armando"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 7}
