Our method defines a grammar for representing changes in building geometry that approximately follow the Manhattan-world assumption which states there is a predominance of three mutually orthogonal directions in the scene. By using multiple calibrated aerial images, we extend previous Manhattan-world methods to robustly produce a single, coherent, complete geometric model of a building with partial textures. Our method uses an optimization to discover a 3D building geometry that produces the same set of facade orientation changes observed in the captured images. We have applied our method to several real-world buildings and have analyzed our approach using synthetic buildings.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Carlos A.
