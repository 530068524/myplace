Context-aware recommenders take this information into account to make predictions. So far, the best performing method for context-aware rating prediction in terms of predictive accuracy is Multiverse Recommendation based on the Tucker tensor factorization model. However this method has two drawbacks: (1) its model complexity is exponential in the number of context variables and polynomial in the size of the factorization and (2) it only works for categorical context variables. On the other hand there is a large variety of fast but specialized recommender methods which lack the generality of context-aware methods.   We propose to apply Factorization Machines (FMs) to model contextual information and to provide context-aware rating predictions. This approach results in fast context-aware recommendations because the model equation of FMs can be computed in linear time both in the number of context variables and the factorization size. For learning FMs, we develop an iterative optimization method that analytically finds the least-square solution for one parameter given the other ones. Finally, we show empirically that our approach outperforms Multiverse Recommendation in prediction quality and runtime.", "citation": "Citations (306)", "departments": ["University of Konstanz", "University of Hildesheim", "University of Hildesheim", "University of Hildesheim"], "authors": ["Steffen Rendle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rendle:Steffen", "Zeno Gantner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gantner:Zeno", "Christoph Freudenthaler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freudenthaler:Christoph", "Lars Schmidt-Thieme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt=Thieme:Lars"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
