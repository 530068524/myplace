This is 40.1 times more DOF and elements, a 2.68-fold improvement in peak performance, and 3.67 times faster in time-to-solution compared to the SC14 Gordon Bell finalist's state-of-the-art simulation. The method scales up to the full K computer with 663,552 CPU cores with 96.6% sizeup efficiency, enabling solving of a 1.08T DOF problem in 29.7 s per time step. Using such heroic computing, we solved a practical problem involving an area 23.7 times larger than the state-of-the-art, and conducted a comprehensive earthquake simulation by combining earthquake wave propagation analysis and evacuation analysis. Application at such scale is a groundbreaking accomplishment and is expected to change the quality of earthquake disaster estimation and contribute to society.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Niigata University", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "RIKEN Advanced  ... ational Science"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Tsuyoshi Ichimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ichimura:Tsuyoshi", "Kohei Fujita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujita:Kohei", "Pher Errol Balde Quinay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quinay:Pher_Errol_Balde", "Lalith Maddegedara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maddegedara:Lalith", "Muneo Hori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hori:Muneo", "Seizo Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Seizo", "Yoshihisa Shizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shizawa:Yoshihisa", "Hiroshi Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Hiroshi", "Kazuo Minami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minami:Kazuo"], "pages": 12}
