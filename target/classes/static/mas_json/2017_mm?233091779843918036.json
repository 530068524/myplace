Recent work adopts fine-tuned strategies to further improve the discriminative power of the descriptors. Taking a different approach, in this paper, we propose a novel framework to achieve competitive retrieval performance. Firstly, we propose various masking schemes, namely   SIFT-mask, SUM-mask  , and   MAX-mask  , to select a representative subset of local convolutional features and remove a large number of redundant features. We demonstrate that this can effectively address the burstiness issue and improve retrieval accuracy. Secondly, we propose to employ recent embedding and aggregating methods to further enhance feature discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Singapore University of Technology and Design", "University of Adelaide", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design"], "authors": ["Tuan Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Tuan", "Thanh-Toan Do.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Do:Thanh=Toan", "Dang-Khoa Le Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Dang=Khoa_Le", "Ngai-Man Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Ngai=Man"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
