We propose a recursive convolutional neural network (RCNN) architecture to capture syntactic and compositional-semantic representations of phrases and words in a dependency tree. Different with the original recursive neural network, we introduce the convolution and pooling layers, which can model a variety of compositions by the feature maps and choose the most informative compositions by the pooling layers. Based on RCNN, we use a discriminative model to re-rank a $k$-best list of candidate dependency parsing trees. The experiments show that RCNN is very effective to improve the state-of-the-art dependency parsing on both English and Chinese datasets.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Chenxi Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Chenxi", "Xipeng Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Xipeng", "Xinchi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xinchi", "Xuanjing Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xuanjing"], "pages": 10}
