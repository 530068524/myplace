{"title": "Mostly modular compilation of crosscutting concerns by contextual predicate dispatch.", "fields": ["aspect oriented programming", "predicate dispatch", "modularity", "aspectj", "formal system"], "abstract": "The modularity of aspect-oriented programming (AOP) has been a controversial issue. To investigate this issue compared with object-oriented programming (OOP), we propose a simple language providing AOP mechanisms, which are enhanced traditional OOP mechanisms. We also present its formal system and then show that programs in this language can be only  mostly  modularly ( i.e.  separately) typechecked and compiled.We mention a source of this unmodularity and discuss whether or not it is appropriate to claim that AOP breaks modularity compared with OOP.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Kyoto University", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Shigeru Chiba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiba:Shigeru", "Atsushi Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Atsushi", "Salikh Zakirov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zakirov:Salikh"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2010", "pages": 16}
