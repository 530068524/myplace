As basic input information, P2P traffic matrices are of significant importance for TE. Due to excessively high cost of direct measurement, a lot of studies aim at modeling and estimating general traffic matrices, but few focus on P2P traffic matrices. In this paper, we proposed a model to estimate P2P traffic matrices in networks. Important factors are considered, including the number of peers, the localization ratio of P2P traffic, and the distances among different networks. Here distance can be hop counts or geographic distance accordingly. To validate our model, we have evaluated the performance using both real P2P live steaming traces and file sharing application traces. Evaluation results show that the proposed model outperforms the other two typical models for general traffic matrices estimation, in terms of estimate errors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research on P2P traffic matrices estimation. P2P traffic matrices, derived from the model, can be applied to P2P traffic optimization and other TE fields.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Ke Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0002:Ke", "Meng Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Meng", "Mingjiang Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Mingjiang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
