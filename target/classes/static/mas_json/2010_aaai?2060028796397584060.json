{"title": "Integrating a Closed World Planner with an Open World Robot: A Case Study.", "fields": ["soft goal", "integrated business planning", "robotics", "urban search and rescue", "planner"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present an integrated planning and robotic architecture that actively directs an agent engaged in an urban search and rescue (USAR) scenario. We describe three salient features that comprise the planning component of this system, namely (1) the ability to plan in a world open with respect to objects, (2) execution monitoring and replanning abilities, and (3) handling soft goals, and detail the interaction of these parts in representing and solving the USAR scenario at hand. We show that though insufficient in an individual capacity, the integration of this trio of features is sufficient to solve the scenario that we present. We test our system with an example problem that involves soft and hard goals, as well as goal deadlines and action costs, and show that the planner is capable of incorporating sensing actions and execution monitoring in order to produce goal-fulfilling plans that maximize the net benefit accrued.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Arizona State University", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "authors": ["Kartik Talamadupula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talamadupula:Kartik", "J.
