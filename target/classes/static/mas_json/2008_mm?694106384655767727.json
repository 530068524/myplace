Our goal was to apply emerging technologies to produce an innovative, hands-on arts learning experience within a conventional art museum. Suspended Animation, a Reflection on Calder is a mixed-reality installation created in response to a sculpture by Alexander Calder. Another Rack for Peto was created in response to a painting by John Frederick Peto. Both installations express formal aspects of the original artworks, and allow visitors to explore specific conceptual themes through their interactions. The project culminated in a six-month exhibition where the original artworks were presented alongside these new installations. We present data that the installations were well received by an audience of 25,000 visitors.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["David Birchfield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Birchfield:David", "Brandon Mechtley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mechtley:Brandon", "Sarah Hatton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hatton:Sarah", "Harvey D.
