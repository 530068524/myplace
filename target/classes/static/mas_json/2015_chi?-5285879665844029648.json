{"title": "Multimodal Analysis in Participatory Design with Children: A Primary School Case Study.", "fields": ["multimedia", "management science", "multimodal therapy", "participatory design", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "We describe a multimodal method for the analysis of co-design outcomes in participatory design (PD) with children. The multimodal approach we take allows researchers to treat both verbal (notes, writings) and tangible material out-comes as complementary ways of communicating design ideas. We argue that an integrated approach in which both PD outcomes are compared and contrasted can result in a richer analysis, in which underlying values can be identified more clearly. To illustrate the method, we describe a PD process with primary school children.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jan Derboven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Derboven:Jan", "Maarten Van Mechelen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mechelen:Maarten_Van", "Karin Slegers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slegers:Karin"], "pages": 4}
