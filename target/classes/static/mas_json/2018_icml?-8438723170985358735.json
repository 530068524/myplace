By building up on this recent theory, in this study, we develop an asynchronous-parallel stochastic L-BFGS algorithm for non-convex optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable for both distributed and shared-memory settings. We provide formal theoretical analysis and show that the proposed method achieves an ergodic convergence rate of ${\\cal O}(1/\\sqrt{N})$ ($N$ being the total number of iterations) and it can achieve a linear speedup under certain conditions. We perform several experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. The results support our theory and show that the proposed algorithm provides a significant speedup over the recently proposed synchronous distributed L-BFGS algorithm.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "Aalto University", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Umut Simsekli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simsekli:Umut", "Cagatay Yildiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yildiz:Cagatay", "Thanh Huy Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Thanh_Huy", "A.
