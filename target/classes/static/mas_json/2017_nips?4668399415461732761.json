{"title": "Affine-Invariant Online Optimization and the Low-rank Experts Problem.", "fields": ["open problem", "curse of dimensionality", "online optimization", "regret", "affine transformation"], "abstract": "We present a new affine-invariant optimization algorithm called Online Lazy Newton. The regret of Online Lazy Newton is independent of conditioning: the algorithm's performance depends on the best possible preconditioning of the problem in retrospect and on its \\emph{intrinsic} dimensionality. As an application, we show how Online Lazy Newton can be used to achieve an optimal regret of order $\\sqrt{rT}$ for the low-rank experts problem, improving by a $\\sqrt{r}$ factor over the previously best known bound and resolving an open problem posed by Hazan et al (2016).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Princeton University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tomer Koren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koren:Tomer", "Roi Livni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Livni:Roi"], "pages": 9}
