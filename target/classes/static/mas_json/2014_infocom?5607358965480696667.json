{"title": "On designing neighbor discovery protocols: A code-based approach.", "fields": ["latency", "service discovery", "asynchronous communication", "testbed", "neighbor discovery protocol"], "abstract": "In mobile wireless networks, the emerging proximity-based applications have led to needs for highly effective and energy-efficient neighbor discovery protocols. However, existing works cannot realize the optimal worst-case latency in symmetric case, and their performances with asymmetric duty cycles can still be improved. In this work, we investigate asynchronous neighbor discovery through a code-based approach, including the symmetric and asymmetric cases. We derive the tight worst-case latency bound in the case of symmetric duty cycle. We design a novel class of symmetric patterns called Diff-Codes, which is optimal when the Diff-Code can be extended from a perfect difference set. We further consider the asymmetric case, and design ADiff-Codes. To evaluate (A)Diff-Codes, we conduct both simulations and testbed experiments. Both simulation and experiment results show that (A)Diff-Codes significantly outperform existing neighbor discovery protocols in both the median case and worst-case. Specifically, in symmetric case, the maximum worst-case improvement is up to 50%; in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, the median case gain is as high as 30%.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Tong Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Tong", "Fan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0006:Fan", "Guihai Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Guihai"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
