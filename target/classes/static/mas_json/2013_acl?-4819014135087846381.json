Based on the measure of preferences between predicates and arguments, the model aggregates all the transitions from a given predicate to its nearby predicates, and propagates their argument preferences as the given predicate\u2019s smoothed preferences. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on the pseudo-disambiguation task, and it better correlates with human plausibility judgements.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhenhua Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Zhenhua", "Hengheng Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Hengheng", "Ziqi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ziqi", "Qinghua Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Qinghua"], "pages": 11}
