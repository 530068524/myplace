Early on, we decided to focus on the character of the Lich King himself, as he plays a central role in the story of the expansion, and not every World of Warcraft player knows his tale from our previous games. As a result, we departed from the \"montage\" style of cinematic we used to introduce World of Warcraft and its first expansion, The Burning Crusade. Our challenge was to simultaneously provide history for players unfamiliar with the Lich King's lore, set up his return, and make it clear to players that the Lich King would be one of the greatest threats they'd yet encountered in World of Warcraft.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Blizzard Entertainment"], "authors": ["Jeff Chamberlain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chamberlain:Jeff"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
