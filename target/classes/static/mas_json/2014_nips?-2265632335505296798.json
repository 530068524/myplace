We consider both the cases of a truthful and surplus-maximizing buyer, where the former makes decisions myopically on every round, and the latter may strategically react to our algorithm, forgoing short-term surplus in order to trick the algorithm into setting better prices in the future. We further assume a buyer's valuation of a good is a function of a context vector that describes the good being sold. We give the first algorithm attaining sublinear (O(T2/3)) regret in the contextual setting against a surplus-maximizing buyer. We also extend this result to repeated second-price auctions with multiple buyers.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kareem Amin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amin:Kareem", "Afshin Rostamizadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rostamizadeh:Afshin", "Umar Syed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Syed:Umar"], "pages": 9}
