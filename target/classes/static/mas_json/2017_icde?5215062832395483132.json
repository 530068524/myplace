{"title": "DistributedLog: A High Performance Replicated Log Service.", "fields": ["analytics", "journaling file system", "ranging", "multitier architecture", "online transaction processing"], "abstract": "DistributedLog is a high performance, strictly ordered, durably replicated log. It is multi-tenant, designed with a layered architecture that allows reads and writes to be scaled independently and supports OLTP, stream processing and batch workloads. It also supports a globally synchronous consistent replicated log spanning multiple geographically separated regions. This paper describes how DistributedLog is structured, its components and the rationale underlying various design decisions. We have been using DistributedLog in production for several years, supporting applications ranging from transactional database journaling, real-time data ingestion, and analytics to general publish-subscribe messaging.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Sijie Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Sijie", "Robin Dhamankar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhamankar:Robin", "Leigh Stewart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stewart:Leigh"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
