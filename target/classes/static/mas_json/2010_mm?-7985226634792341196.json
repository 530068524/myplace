In this work, a video hash algorithm is proposed. This algorithm computes a 180-bit hash value for videos of arbitrary lengths. The hash value can resist common signal processing and slight geometric distortion. The basic mechanism of the algorithm is to compute and accumulate frame hash values. A frame hash algorithm is designed by combining semi-global and local features. Semi-global features are extracted by computing several statistics from image blocks. Local features are extracted by computing a compact edge density map around stable feature points. The good performance of the new algorithm has been demonstrated by experiments.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Li Weng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weng:Li", "Bart Preneel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Preneel:Bart"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
