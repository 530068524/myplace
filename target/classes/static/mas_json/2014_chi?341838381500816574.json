{"title": "Just awful enough: the functional dysfunction of the something awful forums.", "fields": ["public relations", "thriving", "counterintuitive", "online community", "heuristics"], "abstract": "The Something Awful Forums (SAF) is an online community comprised of a loosely connected federation of forums, united in a distinctive brand of humor with a focus on the quality of member contributions. In this case study we find that the site has sustained success while deviating from common conventions and norms of online communities. Humor and the quality of content contributed by SAF members foster practices that seem counterintuitive to the development of a stable and thriving community. In this case study we show how design decisions are contextual and inter-dependent and together these heuristics create a different kind of online third place that challenges common practices.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jessica Annette Pater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pater:Jessica_Annette", "Yacin Nadji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nadji:Yacin", "Elizabeth D.
