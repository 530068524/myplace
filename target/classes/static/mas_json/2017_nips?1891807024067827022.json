Compared with recent advances in this vein, the differential equation considered here is the basic gradient flow, and we derive a class of multi-step schemes which includes accelerated algorithms, using classical conditions from numerical analysis. Multi-step schemes integrate the differential equation using larger step sizes, which intuitively explains the acceleration phenomenon.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "PSL Research University", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "INRIA"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Damien Scieur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scieur:Damien", "Vincent Roulet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roulet:Vincent", "Francis R.
