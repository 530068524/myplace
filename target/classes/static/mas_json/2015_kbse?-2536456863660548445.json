{"title": "Automatic Detection of Potential Layout Faults Following Changes to Responsive Web Pages (N).", "fields": ["client side scripting", "static web page", "web modeling", "web design", "web mapping"], "abstract": "Due to the exponential increase in the number ofmobile devices being used to access the World Wide Web, it iscrucial that web sites are functional and user-friendly across awide range of web-enabled devices. This necessity has resultedin the introduction of responsive web design (RWD), which usescomplex cascading style sheets (CSS) to fluidly modify a web site'sappearance depending on the viewport width of the device in use. Although existing tools may support the testing of responsive websites, they are time consuming and error-prone to use because theyrequire manual screenshot inspection at specified viewport widths. Addressing these concerns, this paper presents a method thatcan automatically detect potential layout faults in responsivelydesigned web sites. To experimentally evaluate this approach, weimplemented it as a tool, called ReDeCheck, and applied itto 5 real-world web sites that vary in both their approach toresponsive design and their complexity. The experiments revealthat ReDeCheck finds 91% of the inserted layout faults.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "University of Sheffield", "Allegheny College"], "authors": ["Thomas A.
