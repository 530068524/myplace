These self-verifying systems select their services dynamically by using a combination of  continual quantitative verification  and  online updating  of the verified models. Our framework enables the practical exploitation of recent theoretical advances in the development of self-adaptive SBSs through (a) automating the generation of the software components responsible for model updating, continual verification and service selection; and (b) employing standard SBS development processes.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of York", "University of York", "University of York"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Radu Calinescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calinescu:Radu", "Kenneth Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Kenneth", "Yasmin Rafiq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rafiq:Yasmin"], "pages": 4}
