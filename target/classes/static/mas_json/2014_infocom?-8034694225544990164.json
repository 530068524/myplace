We will study several restricted coverage problems. The first problem is about K-coverage , i.e., how to deploy wireless nodes such that each target is covered by at least K wireless nodes. We study the problem restricted to linear-K-coverage where there is a line, all targets lie in one side of this line and all wireless nodes lie in the other side. Assume each wireless node is associated with a weight, the objective is to select a minimum weighted subset of nodes such that each target is K-covered. We propose a 3-approximation for this problem by exploring geometric properties. The second problem is called Kroad-coverage. Given a road map in a two-dimensional area which contains a set of paths and a set of wireless nodes, the locations of nodes can either be arbitrary or fixed, the objective is to select a minimum number of wireless nodes such that each path can be K-covered. We will reduce the problem to K-coverage and apply the algorithmic results for K-coverage to solve it. Another line of this work is to investigate a well-motivated problem called strongly dominating set, which is intrinsically related to coverage. Given a wireless networking system represented by a digraph G = (V, \u2212\u2192 E ). Each wireless node u has a covering disk centering at u with its radius equal to the transmission range of u. We then draw a directed edge \u2212\u2192 uv in G if u\u2019s corresponding covering disk contains v. A subset U \u2286 V of wireless nodes is a strongly dominating set if every wireless node in V \\ U has both an in-neighbor in U and an out-neighbor in U . The objective is to find a minimum size strongly dominating set. Our method can achieve an approximation factor of (2 + ).", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Toledo", "University of Toledo"], "conf": "infocom", "authors": ["XiaoHua Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:XiaoHua", "Min Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Min"], "pages": 7}
