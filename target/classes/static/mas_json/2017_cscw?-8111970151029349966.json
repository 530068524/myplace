{"title": "What Happens in Happn: The Warranting Powers of Location History in Online Dating.", "fields": ["common ground", "misrepresentation", "proximate", "uncertainty reduction theory", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "Many location-based dating applications allow users to search for potential matches who are physically proximate. A recent mobile dating application, happn, adds a temporal dimension to location-based dating, showing users the number of times that they crossed path with each other, as well as the location of the most recent overlap. We conducted qualitative interviews with 15 happn users to understand how people make sense of crossed paths, and assess the meanings they assign to these location overlaps. Building on Uncertainty Reduction Theory, we show the various outcomes of the crossed paths and how they play a role in uncertainty reduction. In particular, the warranting power of the device-driven location data was accepted as valuable, and generated little concern about misrepresentation. Moreover, people assigned significant meaning to the minimal cues available from the overlap data. In addition, the location overlap data was useful in allowing users to estimate convenience in meeting and establish common ground. On the other hand, concerns of security and recognition by known others persisted in the happn app. Our findings suggest the potential for utilizing location data outside of the domain of online dating.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Xiao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiao"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
