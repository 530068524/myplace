{"title": "Touch typing using thumbs: understanding the effect of mobility and hand posture.", "fields": ["virtual keyboard", "human computer interaction", "simulation", "multimedia", "typing"], "abstract": "Mobile touch devices have become increasingly popular, yet typing on virtual keyboards whilst walking is still an overwhelming task. In this paper we analyze; firstly, the negative effect of walking on text-input performance, particularly the users' main difficulties and error patterns. We focused our research on thumb typing, since this is a commonly used technique to interact with touch interfaces. Secondly, we analyze how these effects can be compensated by two-hand interaction and increasing target size. We asked 22 participants to input text under three mobility conditions (seated, slow walking, and normal walking) and three hand conditions (one-hand/portrait, two-hand/portrait, and two-hand/landscape). Results show that independently of hand condition, mobility significantly decreased input quality, leading to specific error patterns. Moreover, it was shown that target size can compensate the negative effect of walking, while two-hand interaction does not provide additional stability or input accuracy. We finish with implications for future designs.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["INESC-ID", "INESC-ID"], "authors": ["Hugo Nicolau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nicolau:Hugo", "Joaquim A.
