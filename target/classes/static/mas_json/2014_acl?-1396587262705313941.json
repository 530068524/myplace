R 2 NN is a combination of recursive neural network and recurrent neural network, and in turn integrates their respective capabilities: (1) new information can be used to generate the next hidden state, like recurrent neural networks, so that language model and translation model can be integrated naturally; (2) a tree structure can be built, as recursive neural networks, so as to generate the translation candidates in a bottom up manner. A semi-supervised training approach is proposed to train the parameters, and the phrase pair embedding is explored to model translation confidence directly. Experiments on a Chinese to English translation task show that our proposed R 2 NN can outperform the stateof-the-art baseline by about 1.5 points in BLEU.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shujie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Shujie", "Nan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Nan", "Mu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mu", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming"], "pages": 10}
