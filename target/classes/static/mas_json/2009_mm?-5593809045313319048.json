{"title": "Retrieving multimedia travel stories using location data and spatial queries.", "fields": ["automatic identification and data capture", "assisted gps", "internet privacy", "multimedia", "mobile phone"], "abstract": "We propose a system for retrieving multimedia related to a person's travel, using location data captured with a GPS receiver, mobile phone or a camera. The user makes simple sketches on a map displayed on a computer screen, to submit spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal queries regarding his travel. The system segments the location data and images, analyzes sketches made by a user, identifies the query, and retrieves relevant results. These results, combined with online maps and virtual tours rendered using street view panoramas, form multimedia travel stories. We present the system's current status and conclude with future directions.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Gamhewage C. de Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silva:Gamhewage_C=_de", "Kiyoharu Aizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aizawa:Kiyoharu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
