{"title": "A Linear Time Active Learning Algorithm for Link Classification.", "fields": ["stochastic modelling", "graph", "time complexity", "machine learning", "active learning"], "abstract": "We present very efficient active learning algorithms for link classification in signed networks. Our algorithms are motivated by a stochastic model in which edge labels are obtained through perturbations of a initial sign assignment consistent with a two-clustering of the nodes. We provide a theoretical analysis within this model, showing that we can achieve an optimal (to whithin a constant factor) number of mistakes on any graph G = (V, E) such that |E| = \u03a9(|V|3/2) by querying O(|V|3/2) edge labels. More generally, we show an algorithm that achieves optimality to within a factor of O(k) by querying at most order of |V| + (|V|/k)3/2 edge labels. The running time of this algorithm is at most of order |E| + |V| log |V|.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Milan", "University of Milan", "University of Milan", "Dipartimento di ... nsubria, Italy"], "authors": ["Nicol\u00f2 Cesa-Bianchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cesa=Bianchi:Nicol=ograve=", "Claudio Gentile.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentile:Claudio", "Fabio Vitale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitale:Fabio", "Giovanni Zappella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zappella:Giovanni"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
