In contrast, existing algorithms suffer either from slow convergence, or computationally intensive iterations whose runtime scales with the data size. The algorithm builds on a recent variance-reduced stochastic gradient technique, which was previously analyzed for strongly convex optimization, whereas here we apply it to an inherently non-convex problem, using a very different analysis.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ohad Shamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamir:Ohad"], "pages": 9}
