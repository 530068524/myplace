{"title": "UbiTtention 2017: 2nd international workshop on smart & ambient notification and attention management.", "fields": ["information overload", "bottleneck", "internet of things", "adaptive behavior", "attention management"], "abstract": "In a world moving towards ubiquitous computing, users are increasingly confronted with a tremendous amount of information proactively provided via notifications. Today, notifications are generated by a large number of applications and services, through multiple devices and screens in the users' environment. Thus, human's attention became a significant bottleneck. Further, the latest computing trends with emerging new devices including versatile IoT devices, and contexts, such as smart cities and vehicles, further amplify the challenges. For future computing systems, \"attention management\", including attention representation, sensing, prediction, analysis and adaptive behavior becomes crucial. Following last year's successful UbiTtention'16 workshop with more than 40 participants, the UbiTtention 2017 workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from academy and industry to explore the managements of human attention and notifications. The workshop considers versatile devices and smart situations to overcome information overload and overchoice.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Keio University", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "Telef\u00f3nica"], "authors": ["Tadashi Okoshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okoshi:Tadashi", "Anja Exler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Exler:Anja", "Alexandra Voit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voit:Alexandra", "Dominik Weber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weber:Dominik", "Martin Pielot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pielot:Martin", "Benjamin Poppinga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poppinga:Benjamin", "Niels Henze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henze:Niels", "Sven Gehring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehring:Sven", "Matthias B\u00f6hmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hmer_0001:Matthias", "Seungjun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seungjun", "Veljko Pejovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pejovic:Veljko"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
