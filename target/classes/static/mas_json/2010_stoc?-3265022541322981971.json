Assuming that the homology is defined with integer ($\\mathbb{Z}$) coefficients, we show the following (Theorem 5.2): For a finite simplicial complex $K$ of dimension greater than $p$, the boundary matrix $[\\partial_{p+1}]$ is totally unimodular if and only if $H_p(L, L_0)$ is torsion-free for all pure subcomplexes $L_0, L$ in $K$ of dimensions $p$ and $p+1$, respectively, where $L_0 \\subsetL$. Because of the total unimodularity of the boundary matrix, we can solve the optimization problem, which is inherently an integer programming problem, as a linear program and obtain an integer solution. Thus, the problem of finding optimal cycles in a given homology class can be solved in polynomial time. This result is surprising in the backdrop of a recent result which says that the problem is NP-hard under $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients which, being a field, is in general easier to deal with. Our result implies, among other things, that one can compute in polynomial time an optimal $(d-1)$-cycle in a given homology class for any triangulation of an orientable compact $d$-manifold or for any finite simplicial complex embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Our optimization approach can also be used for various related problems, such as finding an optimal chain homologous to a given one when these are not cycles. Our result can also be viewed as providing a topological characterization of total unimodularity.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Washington State University", "hirani@cs.illinois.edu", "bkrishna@math.wsu.edu"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Tamal K.
