It extends the current spreadsheet paradigm in two ways: (a) PhotoSpread accommodates sets of objects (e.g., photos) annotated with tags (attribute-value pairs). Formulas can manipulate object sets and refer to tags. (b) Photos can be reorganized (tags and location changed) by drag-and-drop operations on the spreadsheet. The PhotoSpread design was driven by the needs of field biologists who have large collections of annotated photos. The paper describes the PhotoSpread functionality and the design choices made.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Max Planck Society", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sean Kandel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kandel:Sean", "Andreas Paepcke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paepcke:Andreas", "Martin Theobald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobald:Martin", "Hector Garcia-Molina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia=Molina:Hector", "Eric Abelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abelson:Eric"], "pages": 10}
