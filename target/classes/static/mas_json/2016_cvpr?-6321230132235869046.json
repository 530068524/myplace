However, as we demonstrate, the transferred representations support only a few modes of separation and much of its dimensionality is unutilized. In this work, we suggest to learn, in the source domain, multiple orthogonal classifiers. We prove that this leads to a reduced rank representation, which, however, supports more discriminative directions. Interestingly, the softmax probabilities produced by the multiple classifiers are likely to be identical. Experimental results, on CIFAR-100 and LFW, further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Etai Littwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Littwin:Etai", "Lior Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Lior"], "pages": 10}
