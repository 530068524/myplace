{"title": "Contour Code: Robust and efficient multispectral palmprint encoding for human recognition.", "fields": ["region of interest", "filter bank", "multispectral image", "hash table", "contourlet"], "abstract": "We propose \u2018Contour Code\u2019, a novel representation and binary hash table encoding for multispectral palmprint recognition. We first present a reliable technique for the extraction of a region of interest (ROI) from palm images acquired with non-contact sensors. The Contour Code representation is then derived from the Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform. A uniscale pyramidal filter is convolved with the ROI followed by the application of a directional filter bank. The dominant directional subband establishes the orientation at each pixel and the index corresponding to this subband is encoded in the Contour Code representation. Unlike existing representations which extract orientation features directly from the palm images, the Contour Code uses a two stage filtering to extract robust orientation features. The Contour Code is binarized into an efficient hash table structure that only requires indexing and summation operations for simultaneous one-to-many matching with an embedded score level fusion of multiple bands. We quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the ROI extraction by comparison with a manually produced ground truth. Multispectral palmprint verification results on the PolyU and CASIA databases show that the Contour Code achieves an EER reduction upto 50%, compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Western Australia", "University of Western Australia", "University of Western Australia"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Zohaib Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Zohaib", "Ajmal S.
