The resulting test statistics are straightforward to compute, and are used in powerful interaction tests, which are consistent against all alternatives for a large family of reproducing kernels. We show the Lancaster test to be sensitive to cases where two independent causes individually have weak influence on a third dependent variable, but their combined effect has a strong influence. This makes the Lancaster test especially suited to finding structure in directed graphical models, where it outperforms competing nonparametric tests in detecting such V-structures.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Gatsby Unit, CSML, UCL, UK", "Gatsby Unit, CSML, UCL, UK", "Department of S ... stics, LSE, UK"], "authors": ["Dino Sejdinovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sejdinovic:Dino", "Arthur Gretton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gretton:Arthur", "Wicher Bergsma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergsma:Wicher"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
