Here we present a new supervised generative stochastic network (GSN) based method to predict local secondary structure with deep hierarchical representations. GSN is a recently proposed deep learning technique (Bengio & Thibodeau-Laufer, 2013) to globally train deep generative model. We present the supervised extension of GSN, which learns a Markov chain to sample from a conditional distribution, and applied it to protein structure prediction. To scale the model to full-sized, high-dimensional data, like protein sequences with hundreds of aminoacids, we introduce a convolutional architecture, which allows efficient learning across multiple layers of hierarchical representations. Our architecture uniquely focuses on predicting structured low-level labels informed with both low and high-level representations learned by the model. In our application this corresponds to labeling the secondary structure state of each amino-acid residue. We trained and tested the model on separate sets of non-homologous proteins sharing less than 30% sequence identity. Our model achieves 66:4% Q8 accuracy on the CB513 dataset, better than the previously reported best performance 64:9% (Wang et al., 2011) for this challenging secondary structure prediction problem.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jian Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Jian", "Olga G.
