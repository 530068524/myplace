Useful mappings are often from the state set to some other set. Examples include representation discovery (a mapping to a feature space) and skill discovery (a mapping to skill termination probabilities). Different mappings result in algorithms achieving varying expected returns. In this paper we present a novel approach to the search for any mapping used by any algorithm attempting to solve an MDP, for that which results in maximum expected return.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Philip S.
