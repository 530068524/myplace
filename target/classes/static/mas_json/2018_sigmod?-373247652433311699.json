{"title": "Pinot: Realtime OLAP for 530 Million Users.", "fields": ["streaming data", "online analytical processing", "queries per second", "nonstop", "low latency"], "abstract": "Modern users demand analytical features on fresh, real time data. Offering these analytical features to hundreds of millions of users is a relevant problem encountered by many large scale web companies.   Relational databases and key-value stores can be scaled to provide point lookups for a large number of users but fall apart at the combination of high ingest rates, high query rates at low latency for analytical queries. Online analytical databases typically rely on bulk data loads and are not typically built to handle nonstop operation in demanding web environments. Offline analytical systems have high throughput but do not offer low query latencies nor can scale to serving tens of thousands of queries per second.   We present Pinot, a single system used in production at Linkedin that can serve tens of thousands of analytical queries per second, offers near-realtime data ingestion from streaming data sources, and handles the operational requirements of large web properties. We also provide a performance comparison with Druid, a system similar to Pinot.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["LinkedIn", "LinkedIn", "LinkedIn", "LinkedIn", "LinkedIn"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Im.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Im:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois", "Kishore Gopalakrishna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalakrishna:Kishore", "Subbu Subramaniam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramaniam:Subbu", "Mayank Shrivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrivastava:Mayank", "Adwait Tumbde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tumbde:Adwait", "Xiaotian Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Xiaotian", "Jennifer Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Jennifer", "Seunghyun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Seunghyun", "Neha Pawar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pawar:Neha", "Jialiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jialiang", "Ravi Aringunram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aringunram:Ravi"], "pages": 12}
