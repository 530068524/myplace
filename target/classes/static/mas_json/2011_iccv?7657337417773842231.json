{"title": "A revisit to cost aggregation in stereo matching: How far can we reduce its computational redundancy?", "fields": ["filter", "template matching", "redundancy", "blossom algorithm", "histogram"], "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for performing an efficient cost aggregation in stereo matching. The cost aggregation problem is re-formulated with a perspective of a histogram, and it gives us a potential to reduce the complexity of the cost aggregation significantly. Different from the previous methods which have tried to reduce the complexity in terms of the size of an image and a matching window, our approach focuses on reducing the computational redundancy which exists among the search range, caused by a repeated filtering for all disparity hypotheses. Moreover, we also reduce the complexity of the window-based filtering through an efficient sampling scheme inside the matching window. The trade-off between accuracy and complexity is extensively investigated into parameters used in the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides high-quality disparity maps with low complexity. This work provides new insights into complexity-constrained stereo matching algorithm design.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Advanced Digita ...
