In this work, we use enclaves to enforce strong application-specific information security policies.   We present  IMP   E  , a novel calculus that captures the essence of SGX-like enclave mechanisms, and show that a security-type system for  IMP   E   can enforce expressive confidentiality policies (including erasure policies and delimited release policies) against powerful low-level attackers, including attackers that can arbitrarily corrupt non-enclave code, and, under some circumstances, corrupt enclave code. We present a translation from an expressive security-typed calculus (that is not aware of enclaves) to  IMP   E  . The translation automatically places code and data into enclaves to enforce the security policies of the source program.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Anitha Gollamudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollamudi:Anitha", "Stephen Chong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chong:Stephen"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2016", "pages": 20}
