Because deriving these new models in order to encode domain knowledge can be difficult and time-consuming, we propose the Fold\u010ball model, which allows the user to specify general domain knowledge in First-Order Logic (FOL). However, combining topic modeling with FOL can result in inference problems beyond the capabilities of existing techniques. We have therefore developed a scalable inference technique using stochastic gradient descent which may also be useful to the Markov Logic Network (MLN) research community. Experiments demonstrate the expressive power of Fold\u010ball, as well as the scalability of our proposed inference method.", "citation": "Citations (116)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["David Andrzejewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andrzejewski:David", "Xiaojin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Xiaojin", "Mark Craven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Craven:Mark", "Benjamin Recht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Recht:Benjamin"], "pages": 7}
