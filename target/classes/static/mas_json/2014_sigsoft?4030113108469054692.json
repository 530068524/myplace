{"title": "Methodology and culture: drivers of mediocrity in software engineering?", "fields": ["excellence", "mediocrity principle", "software quality", "conformity", "software construction"], "abstract": "Methodology implementation failure is attributed to developer mediocrity (by management) \u2013 not to organizational mediocrity (rigidity or control-driven, process-driven management), or to a lack of adaptation capability in the methodology. In supporting software construction as a creative process, however, we must promote excellence rather than conformity. We argue that we \u2013 through principled research -- must pay attention to the interplay between methodology and culture \u2013 the local adaptations needed to make things work, understand how the two co-evolve and how they may contribute together to software quality.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Open University", "University of Victoria"], "authors": ["Marian Petre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petre:Marian", "Daniela E.
