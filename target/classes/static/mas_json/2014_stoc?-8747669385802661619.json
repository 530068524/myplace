However, all families of quantum LDPC codes known to this date suffer from a poor distance scaling limited by the square-root of the code length. This is in a sharp contrast with the classical case where good families of LDPC codes are known that combine constant encoding rate and linear distance. Here we propose the first family of good quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers. The new codes have a constant encoding rate, linear distance, and stabilizers acting on at most  O ( \u221an ) qubits, where  n  is the code length. For comparison, all previously known families of good quantum codes have stabilizers of linear weight. Our proof combines two techniques: randomized constructions of good quantum codes and the homological product operation from algebraic topology. We conjecture that similar methods can produce good stabilizer codes with stabilizer weight  O ( n   \u03b1  ) for any  \u03b1  > 0.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["IBM", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Sergey Bravyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bravyi:Sergey", "Matthew B.
