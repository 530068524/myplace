{"title": "Cut-free completeness for modal mu-calculus.", "fields": ["soundness", "finitary", "corollary", "sequent", "constructive"], "abstract": "We present two finitary cut-free sequent calculi for the modal \u03bc-calculus. One is a variant of Kozen's axiomatisation in which cut is replaced by a strengthening of the induction rule for greatest fixed point. The second calculus derives annotated sequents in the style of Stirling's \u2018tableau proof system with names\u2019 (2014) and features a generalisation of the \u03bd-regeneration rule that allows discharging open assumptions. Soundness and completeness for the two calculi is proved by establishing a sequence of embeddings between proof systems, starting at Stirling's tableau-proofs and ending at the original axiomatisation of the \u03bc-calculus due to Kozen. As a corollary we obtain a new, constructive, proof of completeness for Kozen's axiomatisation which avoids the usual detour through automata and games.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Gothenburg", "University of Gothenburg"], "authors": ["Bahareh Afshari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Afshari:Bahareh", "Graham E.
