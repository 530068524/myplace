This use of the Curry-Howard correspondence allows us to give a novel coverage checking algorithm, and makes it possible to give a rigorous correctness proof for the classical pattern compilation strategy of building decision trees via matrices of patterns.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Neelakantan R.
