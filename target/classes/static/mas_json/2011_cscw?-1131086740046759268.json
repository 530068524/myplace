This paper compares alternative ways of designing online sites to increase member commitment. We report the results of two experiments conducted within a Facebook game application.

These designs influence commitment through different routes.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Groningen"], "authors": ["Rosta Farzan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farzan:Rosta", "Laura A.
