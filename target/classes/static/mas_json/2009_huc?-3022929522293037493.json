We present BlueTone, a framework for developing large display applications which will interpret and react to dual-tone multi-frequency sounds transmitted from mobile phones paired with the display using the Bluetooth headset profile. BlueTone enables text entry, cursor manipulation and menu selection without requiring the installation of any special software on a user's mobile phone.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["David Dearman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dearman:David", "Khai N.
