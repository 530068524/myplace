In office environments, building spaces affect employees' communication, which is crucial for productivity and innovation. However, accurate measurement of how spatial layouts affect interactions is a major challenge and traditional techniques may not give an objective view.   We measure the impact of building spaces on social interactions using wearable sensing devices. We study a single organization that moved between two different buildings, affording a unique opportunity to examine how space alone can affect interactions. The analysis is based on two large scale deployments of wireless sensing technologies: short-range, lightweight RFID tags capable of detecting face-to-face interactions. We analyze the traces to study the impact of the building change on social behavior, which represents a first example of using ubiquitous sensing technology to study how the physical design of two workplaces combines with organizational structure to shape contact patterns.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Kent", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Yahoo!", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Chlo\u00eb Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brown:Chlo=euml=", "Christos Efstratiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efstratiou:Christos", "Ilias Leontiadis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leontiadis:Ilias", "Daniele Quercia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quercia:Daniele", "Cecilia Mascolo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mascolo:Cecilia", "James Scott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scott:James", "Peter Key.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Key:Peter"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
