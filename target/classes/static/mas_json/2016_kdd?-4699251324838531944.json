Indeed, at the micro level, DOM is not only a special concern of house sellers, but also a useful indicator for potential buyers to evaluate the popularity of a house. At the macro level, DOM is an important indicator of real estate market status. However, it is very challenging to measure DOM, since there are a variety of factors which can impact on the DOM of a property. To this end, in this paper, we aim to measure real estate liquidity by examining multiple factors in a holistic manner. A special goal is to predict the DOM of a given property listing. Specifically, we first extract key features from multiple types of heterogeneous real estate-related data, such as house profiles and geo-social information of residential communities. Then, based on these features, we develop a multi-task learning based regression approach for predicting the DOM of real estates. This approach can effectively learn district-aware models for different property listings by considering multiple factors. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world real estate data collected in Beijing and develop a prototype system for practical use. The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for measuring liquidity in real estate markets.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Baidu", "Rutgers University", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Arizona"], "authors": ["Hengshu Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Hengshu", "Hui Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Hui", "Fangshuang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Fangshuang", "Qi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Qi", "Yong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Yong", "Enhong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Enhong", "Yanjie Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Yanjie"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
