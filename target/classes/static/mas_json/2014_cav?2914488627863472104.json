There are three possible return values for our procedure: it either returns a model for the input formula, or it says that the input is unsatisfiable, or it fails because the applicability condition for the procedure, called the eigen-condition, is violated. For the class of constraints where the eigen-condition holds, our procedure is a decision procedure. We describe satisfiability-preserving transformations that can potentially convert problems into a form where eigen-condition holds. We experimentally evaluate the procedure and discuss applicability.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["SRI International", "SRI International"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ashish Tiwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwari:Ashish", "Patrick Lincoln.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lincoln:Patrick"], "pages": 8}
