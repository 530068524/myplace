{"title": "Fighting for my space: coping mechanisms for sns boundary regulation.", "fields": ["interaction design", "interpersonal communication", "coping", "categorization", "social network"], "abstract": "Sharing information online via social network sites (SNSs) is at an all-time high, yet research shows that users often exhibit a marked dissatisfaction in using such sites. A compelling explanation for this dichotomy is that users are struggling against their SNS environment in an effort to achieve their preferred levels of privacy for regulating social interactions. Our research investigates users' SNS boundary regulation behavior. This paper presents results from a qualitative interview-based study to identify \"coping mechanisms\" that users devise outside explicit boundary-regulation interface features in order to manage interpersonal boundaries. Our categorization of such mechanisms provides insight into interaction design issues and opportunities for new SNS features.", "citation": "Citations (103)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "authors": ["Pamela J.
