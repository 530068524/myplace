{"title": "Social interaction detection using a multi-sensor approach.", "fields": ["social relation", "cyberspace", "social computing", "multimedia", "data stream mining"], "abstract": "In the context of a social gathering, such as a cocktail party, the memorable moments are often captured by professional photographers or the participants. The latter case is generally undesirable because many participants would rather enjoy the event instead of being occupied by the tedious photo capturing task. Motivated by this scenario, we propose an automated social event photo-capture framework for which, given the multiple sensor data streams and the information from the Web as input, will output the visually appealing photos of the social event. Our proposal consists of three components: (1) social attribute extraction from both the physical space and the cyberspace; (2) social attribute fusion; and (3) active camera control. Current work is presented and we conclude with expected contributions as well as future direction.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Tian Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Tian"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
