Previous work has very successfully exploited planning landmarks in satisficing (non-optimal) planning. We propose a methodology for deriving admissible heuristic estimates for cost-optimal planning from a set of planning landmarks. The resulting heuristics fall into a novel class of multi-path dependent heuristics, and we present a simple best-first search procedure exploiting such heuristics. Our empirical evaluation shows that this framework favorably competes with the state-of-the-art of cost-optimal heuristic search.", "citation": "Citations (170)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Erez Karpas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karpas:Erez", "Carmel Domshlak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Domshlak:Carmel"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
