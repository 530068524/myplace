{"title": "Exploring biomedical databases with BioNav.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "database", "user interface", "data mining", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "We demonstrate the BioNav system, a novel search interface for biomedical databases, such as PubMed. BioNav enables users to navigate large number of query results by categorizing them using MeSH; a comprehensive concept hierarchy used by PubMed. Once the query results are organized into a navigation tree, BioNav reveals only a small subset of the concept nodes at each step, selected such that the expected user navigation cost is minimized. In contrast, previous works expand the hierarchy in a predefined static manner, without navigation cost modeling.
