{"title": "Cryptography from Compression Functions: The UCE Bridge to the ROM.", "fields": ["random oracle", "exploit", "parallelizable manifold", "hash function", "compression"], "abstract": "This paper suggests and explores the use of UCE security for the task of turning VIL-ROM schemes into FIL-ROM ones. The benefits we offer over indifferentiability, the current leading method for this task, are the ability to handle multi-stage games and greater efficiency. The paradigm consists of (1) Showing that a VIL UCE function can instantiate the VIL RO in the scheme, and (2) Constructing the VIL UCE function given a FIL random oracle. The main technical contributions of the paper are domain extension transforms that implement the second step. Leveraging known results for the first step we automatically obtain FIL-ROM constructions for several primitives whose security notions are underlain by multi-stage games.Our first domain extender exploits indifferentiability, showing that although the latter does not work directly for multi-stage games it can be used indirectly, through UCE, as a tool for this end. Our second domain extender targets performance. It is parallelizable and shown through implementation to provide significant performance gains over indifferentiable domain extenders.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Viet Tung Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Viet_Tung", "Sriram Keelveedhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keelveedhi:Sriram"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2014", "pages": 19}
