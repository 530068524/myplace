{"title": "Newtron: an Efficient Bandit algorithm for Online Multiclass Prediction.", "fields": ["open problem", "scalar", "infinity", "newton s method", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We present an efficient algorithm for the problem of online multiclass prediction with bandit feedback in the fully adversarial setting. We measure its regret with respect to the log-loss defined in [AR09], which is parameterized by a scalar a. We prove that the regret of NEWTRON is O(log T) when \u03b1 is a constant that does not vary with horizon T, and at most O(T2/3) if \u03b1 is allowed to increase to infinity with T. For \u03b1 = O(log T), the regret is bounded by O(\u221aT), thus solving the open problem of [KSST08, AR09]. Our algorithm is based on a novel application of the online Newton method [HAK07]. We test our algorithm and show it to perform well in experiments, even when \u03b1 is a small constant.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad", "Satyen Kale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kale:Satyen"], "pages": 9}
