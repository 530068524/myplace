{"title": "Designing Smart Objects with Autistic Children: Four Design Expos\u00e8s.", "fields": ["open design", "design knowledge", "participatory design", "smart objects", "autism"], "abstract": "This paper describes the design work being conducted as part of the OutsideTheBox project. Within the time-frame of eight months, we engaged four children with autism in a participatory design process to develop their own smart object. We re-interpreted Future Workshops and Co-operative Inquiry to demonstrate that a) autistic children can lead processes with a deliberately open design brief and b) this leads us to explore design spaces that are un-imaginable for neuro-typical, adult designers. To capture these four design cases, we have developed Design Exposes, a concept that is inspired by annotated portfolios and Actor-Network Theory. We apply this concept to our cases and present four exposes that subsequently allow us to draw out intermediate-level design knowledge about co-creating technology with autistic children. We close by critically reflecting on the design processes as well as our concept of capturing them.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christopher Frauenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frauenberger:Christopher", "Julia Makhaeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makhaeva:Julia", "Katharina Spiel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spiel:Katharina"], "pages": 10}
