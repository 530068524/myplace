In this paper, we explore the utilization of these statistics as request signaturesin server applications for identifying requests and inferring high-level request properties ( e.g. , CPU and I/O resource needs). Our key finding is that effective request signatures may be constructed using a small amount of hardware statistics while the request is still in an early stage of its execution. Such  on-the-fly  request identification and property inference allow guided operating system adaptation at request granularity ( e.g. , resource-aware request scheduling and on-the-fly request classification). We address the challenges of selecting hardware counter metrics for signature construction and providing necessary operating system support for per-request statistics management. Our implementation in the Linux 2.6.10 kernel suggests that our approach requires low overhead suitable for runtime deployment. Our on-the-fly request resource consumption inference (averaging 7%, 3%, 20%, and 41% prediction errors for four server workloads, TPC-C, TPC-H, J2EE-based RUBiS, and a trace-driven index search, respectively) is much more accurate than the online running-average based prediction (73-82% errors). Its use for resource-aware request scheduling results in a 15-70% response time reduction for three CPU-bound applications. Its use for on-the-fly request classification and anomaly detection exhibits high accuracy for the TPC-H workload with synthetically generated anomalous requests following a typical SQL-injection attack pattern.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Kai Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Kai", "Ming Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Ming", "Sandhya Dwarkadas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dwarkadas:Sandhya", "Chuanpeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chuanpeng", "Christopher Stewart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stewart:Christopher", "Xiao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiao"], "pages": 12}
