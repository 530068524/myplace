We prove that the equality of interpretations in Pcoh characterizes the operational indistinguishability of programs in PCF with a random primitive.   This is the first result of full abstraction for a semantics of probabilistic PCF. The key ingredient relies on the regularity of power series.   Along the way to the theorem, we design a weighted intersection type assignment system giving a logical presentation of PCoh.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Paris Diderot University", "Paris Diderot University", "University of Paris"], "authors": ["Thomas Ehrhard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ehrhard:Thomas", "Christine Tasson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tasson:Christine", "Michele Pagani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pagani:Michele"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
