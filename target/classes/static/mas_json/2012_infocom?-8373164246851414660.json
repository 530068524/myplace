In this paper, we address two fundamental issues in a cloud environment: privacy and efficiency. We first review a private keyword-based file retrieval scheme proposed by Ostrovsky et. al. Then, based on an aggregation and distribution layer (ADL), we present a scheme, termed efficient information retrieval for ranked query (EIRQ), to further reduce querying costs incurred in the cloud. Queries are classified into multiple ranks, where a higher ranked query can retrieve a higher percentage of matched files. Extensive evaluations have been conducted on an analytical model to examine the effectiveness of our scheme.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["Central South University", "Temple University", "Temple University", "Central South University"], "authors": ["Qin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Qin", "Chiu Chiang Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chiu_Chiang", "Jie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Jie", "Guojun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Guojun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
