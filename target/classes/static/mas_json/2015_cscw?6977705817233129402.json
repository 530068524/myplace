{"title": "Engaging Around Neighborhood Issues: How Online Communication Affects Offline Behavior.", "fields": ["online and offline", "content analysis", "icts", "computer mediated communication", "civic engagement"], "abstract": "This paper describes how online conversations about crime amongst local residents impact offline behavior. We conducted a three-year study in five middle to low-income geographically-bound communities (defined as police beats), where we observed community meetings for two years, interviewed 45 residents, and performed qualitative content analysis on over 7,000 online messages on community-based email lists and web forums. Interviewees reported that community-based online communication influenced how they 1) protect themselves and their property to avoid victimization and 2) participate and engage in local in-person civic engagement initiatives. This paper provides insights into the relationship between online and offline behavior and implications for designing community-based ICTs that effectively address local issues.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["DePaul University"], "authors": ["Sheena L.
