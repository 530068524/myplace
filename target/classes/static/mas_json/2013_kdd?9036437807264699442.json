Real-time search demands that they be indexed and searchable immediately, which leads to a number of implementation challenges. In this paper, we focus on one aspect: dynamic postings allocation policies for index structures that are completely held in main memory. The core issue can be characterized as a \"Goldilocks Problem\". Because memory remains today a scare resource, an allocation policy that is too aggressive leads to inefficient utilization, while a policy that is too conservative is slow and leads to fragmented postings lists. We present a dynamic postings allocation policy that allocates memory in increasingly-larger \"slices\" from a small number of large, fixed pools of memory. With an analytical model and experiments, we explore different settings that balance time (query evaluation speed) and space (memory utilization).", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Twitter"], "authors": ["Nima Asadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asadi_0001:Nima", "Jimmy J.
