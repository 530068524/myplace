This is particularly problematic in multiagent POMDPs where the action and observation space grows exponentially with the number of agents. To combat this intractability, we propose a novel scalable approach based on sample-based planning and factored value functions that exploits structure present in many multiagent settings. This approach applies not only in the planning case, but also in the Bayesian reinforcement learning setting. Experimental results show that we are able to provide high quality solutions to large multiagent planning and learning problems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Kyung Hee University", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Kyung Hee University", "Google", "Google", "Google", "University of Stuttgart", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Weingarten Realty Investors", "Chalmers University of Technology"], "authors": ["Yi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0006:Yi", "Kok Sung Won.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Won:Kok_Sung", "David Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:David", "Wee Sun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wee_Sun"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
