A consistency framework is suggested that is suitable for highly dependent time-series, and an asymptotically consistent algorithm is proposed. In order for the consistency to be established the only assumption required is that the data is generated by stationary ergodic time-series distributions. No modeling, independence or parametric assumptions are made; the data are allowed to be dependent and the dependence can be of arbitrary form. The theoretical results are complemented with experimental evaluations.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Lille University of Science and Technology", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Azadeh Khaleghi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khaleghi:Azadeh", "Daniil Ryabko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryabko:Daniil"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
