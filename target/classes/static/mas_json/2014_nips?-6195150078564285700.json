Nonetheless, there still remains a question how to learn a good association between data modalities; in particular, a good generative model of multimodal data should be able to reason about missing data modality given the rest of data modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal representation learning framework that explicitly aims this goal. Rather than learning with maximum likelihood, we train the model to minimize the variation of information. We provide a theoretical insight why the proposed learning objective is sufficient to estimate the data-generating joint distribution of multimodal data. We apply our method to restricted Boltzmann machines and introduce learning methods based on contrastive divergence and multi-prediction training. In addition, we extend to deep networks with recurrent encoding structure to finetune the whole network. In experiments, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art visual recognition performance on MIR-Flickr database and PASCAL VOC 2007 database with and without text features.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Electrical Engi ... and Engineering"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kihyuk Sohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sohn:Kihyuk", "Wenling Shang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shang:Wenling", "Honglak Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Honglak"], "pages": 9}
