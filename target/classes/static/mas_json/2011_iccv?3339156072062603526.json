That is to say, matching eyes with eyes and mouths with mouths etc\u2025 In this paper, we propose that face can be also recognized by matching non-corresponding facial regions. In another word face can be recognized by matching eyes with mouths, for example. Specifically, the problem we study in this paper can be formulated as how to measure the possibility whether two non-corresponding face regions belong to the same face. We propose that the possibility can be measured via canonical correlation analysis. Experimental results show that it is feasible to recognize face via non-corresponding region matching. The proposed method provides an alternative and more flexible way to recognize faces.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Peking University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Annan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Annan", "Shiguang Shan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shan:Shiguang", "Xilin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xilin", "Wen Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Wen"], "pages": 8}
