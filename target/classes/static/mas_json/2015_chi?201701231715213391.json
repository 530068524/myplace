We present the design of Exploration Wall, a touch-based search user interface that allows incremental exploration and sense-making of large information spaces by combining entity search, flexible use of result entities as query parameters, and spatial configuration of search streams that are visualized for interaction. Entities can be flexibly reused to modify and create new search streams, and manipulated to inspect their relationships with other entities. Data comprising of task-based experiments comparing Exploration Wall with conventional search user interface indicate that Exploration Wall achieves significantly improved recall for exploratory search tasks while preserving precision. Subjective feedback supports our design choices and indicates improved user satisfaction and engagement. Our findings can help to design user interfaces that can effectively support exploratory search on touch devices.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Helsinki", "Aalto University", "University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki", "Charles III University of Madrid"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Khalil Klouche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klouche:Khalil", "Tuukka Ruotsalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruotsalo:Tuukka", "Diogo Cabral.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cabral:Diogo", "Salvatore Andolina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andolina:Salvatore", "Andrea Bellucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellucci:Andrea", "Giulio Jacucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacucci:Giulio"], "pages": 10}
