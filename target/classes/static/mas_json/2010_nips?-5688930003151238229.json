{"title": "Multi-Stage Dantzig Selector.", "fields": ["design matrix", "bounded function", "gaussian", "lp space", "oracle"], "abstract": "We consider the following sparse signal recovery (or feature selection) problem: given a design matrix X \u2208 \u211dn x m (m \u226b n) and a noisy observation vector y \u2208 \u211dn satisfying y = X \u03b2* + e where e is the noise vector following a Gaussian distribution N(0, \u03c32I), how to recover the signal (or parameter vector) \u03b2* when the signal is sparse?\n\nThe Dantzig selector has been proposed for sparse signal recovery with strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Dantzig selector method, which iteratively refines the target signal \u03b2*. We show that if X obeys a certain condition, then with a large probability the difference between the solution ^\u03b2 estimated by the proposed method and the true solution \u03b2* measured in terms of the lp norm (p \u2265 1) is bounded as\n\n\u2016^\u03b2 - \u03b2 \u2016p \u2264 (C(s - N)1/p \u221alog m + \u0394) \u03c3,\n\nwhere C is a constant, s is the number of nonzero entries in \u03b2*, A is independent of m and is much smaller than the first term, and N is the number of entries of \u03b2* larger than a certain value in the order of O(\u03c3/\u221alog m). The proposed method improves the estimation bound of the standard Dantzig selector approximately from Cs1/p \u221alog m\u03c3 to C(s - N)1/p\u221alog m\u03c3 where the value N depends on the number of large entries in \u03b2*. When N = s, the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle solution with a high probability. In addition, with a large probability, the proposed method can select the same number of correct features under a milder condition than the Dantzig selector.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Ji Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Ji", "Peter Wonka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wonka:Peter", "Jieping Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jieping"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
