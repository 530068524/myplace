In this work, we consider a simple yet important sub-problem: translation from textual descriptions to If-Then programs. We devise a novel neural network architecture for this task which we train end-to-end. Specifically, we introduce Latent Attention, which computes multiplicative weights for the words in the description in a two-stage process with the goal of better leveraging the natural language structures that indicate the relevant parts for predicting program elements. Our architecture reduces the error rate by 28.57% compared to prior art. We also propose a one-shot learning scenario of If-Then program synthesis and simulate it with our existing dataset. We demonstrate a variation on the training procedure for this scenario that outperforms the original procedure, significantly closing the gap to the model trained with all data.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Chang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chang", "Xinyun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xinyun", "Eui Chul Richard Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Eui_Chul_Richard", "Mingcheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Mingcheng", "Dawn Xiaodong Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Dawn_Xiaodong"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
