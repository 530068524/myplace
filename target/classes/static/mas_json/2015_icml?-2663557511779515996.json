We propose PeakSeg, a new constrained maximum likelihood segmentation model for peak detection with an efficient inference algorithm: constrained dynamic programming. We investigate unsupervised and supervised learning of penalties for the critical model selection problem. We show that the supervised method has state-of-the-art peak detection across all data sets in a benchmark that includes both sharp H3K4me3 and broad H3K36me3 patterns.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["McGill University", "University of Paris-Sud", "Paris Diderot University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Toby Hocking.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hocking:Toby", "Guillem Rigaill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rigaill:Guillem", "Guillaume Bourque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bourque:Guillaume"], "pages": 9}
