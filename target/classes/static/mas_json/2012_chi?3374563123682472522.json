Using behavioral and demographic data from 1,037 World of Warcraft players, we use multiple regressions to provide this mapping. Given current interest in \"gamifying\" applications, we believe these findings are relevant for both gaming and non-gaming research.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["PARC", "PARC", "University of Minnesota", "PARC"], "authors": ["Nick Yee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yee:Nick", "Nicolas Ducheneaut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ducheneaut:Nicolas", "Han-Tai Shiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shiao:Han=Tai", "Les Nelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nelson:Les"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
