Uncertainty can be at the attribute or tuple level and is present in both continuous and discrete data domains. This paper presents a model for handling arbitrary probabilistic uncertain data (both discrete and continuous) natively at the database level. Our approach leads to a natural and efficient representation for probabilistic data. We develop a model that is consistent with possible worlds semantics and closed under basic relational operators. This is the first model that accurately and efficiently handles both continuous and discrete uncertainty. The model is implemented in a real database system (PostgreSQL) and the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach is validated experimentally.", "citation": "Citations (103)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Louisiana State University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Sarvjeet Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Sarvjeet", "Chris Mayfield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayfield:Chris", "Rahul Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Rahul", "Sunil Prabhakar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakar:Sunil", "Susanne E.
