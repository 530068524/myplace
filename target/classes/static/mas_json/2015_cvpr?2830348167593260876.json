Our main emphasis is on speed and accuracy. We build on [31] to define the problem as a boundary and topology preserving Markov random field. We propose a coarse to fine optimization technique that speeds up inference in terms of the number of updates by an order of magnitude. Our approach is shown to outperform [31] while employing a single iteration. We evaluate and compare our approach to state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms on the BSD and KITTI benchmarks. Our approach significantly outperforms the baselines in the segmentation metrics and achieves the lowest error on the stereo task.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Ljubljana", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jian Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Jian", "Marko Boben.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boben:Marko", "Sanja Fidler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fidler:Sanja", "Raquel Urtasun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urtasun:Raquel"], "pages": 9}
