It provides a framework for combining multiple base clusterings of a data set to generate a final consensus result. Most existing clustering methods simply combine clustering results without taking into account the noises, which may degrade the clustering performance. In this paper, we propose a novel robust clustering ensemble method. To improve the robustness, we capture the sparse and symmetric errors and integrate them into our robust and consensus framework to learn a low-rank matrix. Since the optimization of the objective function is difficult to solve, we develop a block coordinate descent algorithm which is theoretically guaranteed to converge. Experimental results on real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Peng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Peng", "Liang Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Liang", "Hanmo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hanmo", "Lei Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Lei", "Yi-Dong Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yi=Dong"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
