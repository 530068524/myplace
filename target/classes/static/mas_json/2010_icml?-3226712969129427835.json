Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, NMF is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.", "citation": "Citations (1,235)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "University of Houston", "University of Houston", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Qufu Normal University", "University College London", "University of Cambridge", "Computer Scienc ... and Engineering", "Computer Scienc ... and Engineering"], "authors": ["Frank Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Frank", "William W.
