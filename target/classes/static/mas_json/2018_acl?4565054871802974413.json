While fairly successful, previous techniques generally require two-stage training, and the binary constraints are handled ad-hoc. In this paper, we present an end-to-end Neural Architecture for Semantic Hashing (NASH), where the binary hashing codes are treated as Bernoulli latent variables. A neural variational inference framework is proposed for training, where gradients are directly back-propagated through the discrete latent variable to optimize the hash function. We also draw connections between proposed method and rate-distortion theory, which provides a theoretical foundation for the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on both unsupervised and supervised scenarios.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ricardo Henao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henao:Ricardo", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence", "Qinliang Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Qinliang", "Dinghan Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Dinghan", "Guoyin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Guoyin", "Wenlin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wenlin", "Paidamoyo Chapfuwa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chapfuwa:Paidamoyo"], "pages": 10}
