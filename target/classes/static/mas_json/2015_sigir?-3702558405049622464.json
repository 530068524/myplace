In this paper, we propose a multi-objective ensemble learning solution that (1) allows to accurately classify queries along their temporal intent and (2) identifies a set of performing solutions thus offering a wide range of possible applications. Experiments show that correct representation of the problem can lead to great classification improvements when compared to recent state-of-the-art solutions and baseline ensemble techniques.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Patna", "Normandie Unive ... y, Caen, France", "Normandie Unive ... y, Caen, France", "Normandie Unive ... y, Caen, France"], "authors": ["Mohammed Hasanuzzaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasanuzzaman:Mohammed", "Sriparna Saha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saha_0001:Sriparna", "Ga\u00ebl Dias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dias:Ga=euml=l", "St\u00e9phane Ferrari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferrari:St=eacute=phane"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
