In this paper, we present an SRL system for Modern Standard Arabic that exploits many aspects of the rich morphological features of the language. The experiments on the pilot Arabic Propbank data show that our system based on Support Vector Machines and Kernel Methods yields a global SRL F1 score of 82.17%, which improves the current state-of-the-art in Arabic SRL.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Columbia University", "University of Trento"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mona T.
