We present a combination of these techniques, Symbolic Merge-and-Shrink (SM&S), which uses M&S abstractions as a relaxation criterion for a symbolic backward search. Empirical evaluation shows that SM&S has the strengths of both techniques deriving heuristics at least as good as the best of them for most domains.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Charles III University of Madrid", "Charles III University of Madrid", "Charles III University of Madrid"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["\u00c1lvaro Torralba Arias de Reyna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reyna:=Aacute=lvaro_Torralba_Arias_de", "Carlos Linares L\u00f3pez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=oacute=pez:Carlos_Linares", "Daniel Borrajo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borrajo:Daniel"], "pages": 7}
