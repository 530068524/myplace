Since a large and increasing number of studies in Software Engineering (SE) incorporate qualitative data, it is important to systematically review and understand different aspects of the Qualitative Research Synthesis (QRS) being used in SE. We have reviewed the use of QRS methods in 328 SLRs published between 2005 and 2015. We also inquired the authors of 274 SLRs to confirm whether or not any QRS methods were used in their respective reviews. 116 of them provided the responses, which were included in our analysis. We found eight QRS methods applied in SE research, two of which,  narrative synthesis  and  thematic synthesis,  have been predominantly adopted by SE researchers for synthesizing qualitative data. Our study determines that a significant amount of missing knowledge and incomplete understanding of the defined QRS methods in the community. Our effort also identifies an initial set factors that may influence the selection and use of appropriate QRS methods in SE.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "University of Adelaide", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Xin Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xin", "He Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:He", "Xin Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xin", "Muhammad Ali Babar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babar:Muhammad_Ali", "Song Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Song"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2018", "pages": 12}
