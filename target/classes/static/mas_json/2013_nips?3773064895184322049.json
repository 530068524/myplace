This set is a ball around a density function estimated from data samples, i.e., it is data-driven and random. Polynomial optimization problems are inherently hard due to nonconvex objectives and constraints. However, we show that by employing polynomial and histogram density estimates, we can introduce robustness with respect to distributional uncertainty sets without making the problem harder. We show that the optimum to the distributionally robust problem is the limit of a sequence of tractable semidefinite programming relaxations. We also give finite-sample consistency guarantees for the data-driven uncertainty sets. Finally, we apply our model and solution method in a water network optimization problem.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Martin Mevissen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mevissen:Martin", "Emanuele Ragnoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ragnoli:Emanuele", "Jia Yuan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jia_Yuan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
