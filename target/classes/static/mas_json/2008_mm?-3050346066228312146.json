In this paper, we propose a new indexing/searching method based on Randomized Sub-Vectors Hashing (called RSVH) for high-dimensional image feature matching. The essential of the proposed idea is that the feature vectors are considered similar (measured by Euclidean distance) when the L2 norms of their corresponding randomized sub-vectors are approximately same respectively. Experimental results have demonstrated that our algorithm can perform much better than the famous BBF (Best-Bin-First) and LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) algorithms in extensive image matching and image retrieval applications.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University"], "authors": ["Heng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Heng", "Qing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qing", "Zhoucan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Zhoucan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
