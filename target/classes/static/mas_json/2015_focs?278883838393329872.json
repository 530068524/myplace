In other words, there is a polynomial time algorithm that approximates the value of the optimum tour within a factor of polyloglog(n), where polyloglog(n) is a bounded degree polynomial of log log(n). We prove this by showing that any k-edge-connected unweighted graph has a polyloglog(n)/k-thin spanning tree. Our main new ingredient is a procedure, albeit an exponentially sized convex program, that \"transforms\" graphs that do not admit any spectrally thin trees into those that provably have spectrally thin trees. More precisely, given a k-edge-connected graph G=(V, E) where k>= 7log(n), we show that there is a matrix D that \"preserves\" the structure of all cuts of G such that for a subset F of E that induces an O(k)-edge-connected graph, the effective resistance of every edge in F w.r.t. D is at most polylog(k)/k. Then, we use our recent extension of the seminal work of Marcus, Spiel man, and Srivastava [MSS13] to prove the existence of a polylog(k)/k-spectrally thin tree with respect to D. Such a tree is polylog(k)/k-combinatorially thin with respect to G as D preserves the structure of cuts of G.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Nima Anari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anari:Nima", "Shayan Oveis Gharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gharan:Shayan_Oveis"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
