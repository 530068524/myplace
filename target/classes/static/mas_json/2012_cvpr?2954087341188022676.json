{"title": "Accidental pinhole and pinspeck cameras: Revealing the scene outside the picture.", "fields": ["pinhole camera", "image subtraction", "shadow", "accidental", "pinhole camera model"], "abstract": "We identify and study two types of \u201caccidental\u201d images that can be formed in scenes. The first is an accidental pinhole camera image. These images are often mistaken for shadows, but can reveal structures outside a room, or the unseen shape of the light aperture into the room. The second class of accidental images are \u201cinverse\u201d pinhole camera images, formed by subtracting an image with a small occluder present from a reference image without the occluder. The reference image can be an earlier frame of a video sequence. Both types of accidental images happen in a variety of different situations (an indoor scene illuminated by natural light, a street with a person walking under the shadow of a building, etc.). Accidental cameras can reveal information about the scene outside the image, the lighting conditions, or the aperture by which light enters the scene.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Antonio Torralba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torralba_0001:Antonio", "William T.
