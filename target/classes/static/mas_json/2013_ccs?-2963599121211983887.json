{"title": "25 million flows later: large-scale detection of DOM-based XSS.", "fields": ["scripting language", "cross site scripting", "javascript", "exploit", "internet privacy"], "abstract": "In recent years, the Web witnessed a move towards sophis- ticated client-side functionality. This shift caused a signifi- cant increase in complexity of deployed JavaScript code and thus, a proportional growth in potential client-side vulnera- bilities, with DOM-based Cross-site Scripting being a high impact representative of such security issues. In this paper, we present a fully automated system to detect and validate DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities, consisting of a taint-aware JavaScript engine and corresponding DOM implementation as well as a context-sensitive exploit generation approach. Using these components, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the Alexa top 5000. In this study, we identified 6167 unique vulnerabilities distributed over 480 domains, show- ing that 9,6% of the examined sites carry at least one DOM- based XSS problem.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["SAP AG, Karlsruhe, Germany", "Friedrich-Alexa ... emberg, Germany", "SAP AG, Karlsruhe, Germany"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Sebastian Lekies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lekies:Sebastian", "Ben Stock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stock:Ben", "Martin Johns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johns:Martin"], "pages": 12}
