{"title": "Toward generating reducible replay logs.", "fields": ["debugging", "on the fly", "software quality", "logging", "compiler"], "abstract": "Logging and replay is important to reproducing software failures and recovering from failures. Replaying a long execution is time consuming, especially when replay is further integrated with runtime techniques that require expensive instrumentation, such as dependence detection. In this paper, we propose a technique to reduce a replay log while retaining its ability to reproduce a failure. While traditional logging records only system calls and signals, our technique leverages the compiler to selectively collect additional information on the fly. Upon a failure, the log can be reduced by analyzing itself. The collection is highly optimized. The additional runtime overhead of our technique, compared to a plain logging tool, is trivial (2.61% average) and the size of additional log is comparable to the original log. Substantial reduction can be cost-effectively achieved through a search based algorithm. The reduced log is guaranteed to reproduce the failure.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Kyu Hyung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kyu_Hyung", "Yunhui Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yunhui", "Nick Sumner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sumner:Nick", "Xiangyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Xiangyu"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
