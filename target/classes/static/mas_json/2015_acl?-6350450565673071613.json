Investigating further, we find that performance on this task can be related to orthogonality within the space. Explicitly designing such structure into a neural network model results in representations that decompose into orthogonal semantic and syntactic subspaces. We demonstrate that learning from word-order and morphological structure within English Wikipedia text to enable this decomposition can produce substantial improvements on semantic-similarity, posinduction and word-analogy tasks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jeff Mitchell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitchell:Jeff", "Mark Steedman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steedman:Mark"], "pages": 10}
