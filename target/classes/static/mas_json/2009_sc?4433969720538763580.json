These leadership-class systems face daunting challenges to deploying scalable I/O systems. In this paper we present a case study of the I/O challenges to performance and scalability on Intrepid, the IBM Blue Gene/P system at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. Listed in the top 5 fastest supercomputers of 2008, Intrepid runs computational science applications with intensive demands on the I/O system. We show that Intrepid's file and storage system sustain high performance under varying workloads as the applications scale with the number of processes.", "citation": "Citations (151)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Samuel Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:Samuel", "Philip H.
