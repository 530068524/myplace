In the transition from usability metrics to user experience, what appears lacking is a more explicit characterization of what it is HCI now strives for as a discipline--i.e. what constitutes a 'good' user experience? Through a detailed look at two contemporary philosophies of technology--Albert Borgmann's notion of the device paradigm and Don Ihde's non-neutrality of technology-mediated experience--this paper seeks to explore the potential of the philosophy of technology to contribute new insights and provide well-grounded conceptual tools for coming to terms with what may become HCI's 'new good'.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Ume\u00e5 University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Fallman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fallman:Daniel"], "pages": 10}
