{"title": "Puzzle assembly training: Real world vs. virtual environment.", "fields": ["haptic technology", "virtual training", "burr puzzle", "physical test", "stereoscopy"], "abstract": "While training participants to assemble a 3D wooden burr puzzle, we compared results of training in a stereoscopic, head tracked virtual assembly environment utilizing haptic devices and data gloves with real world training. While virtual training took participants about three times longer, the group that used the virtual environment was able to assemble the physical test puzzle about three times faster than the group trained with the physical puzzle. We present several possible cognitive explanations for these results and our plans for future exploration of the factors that improve the effectiveness of virtual process training over real world experience.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Mike Oren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oren:Mike", "Patrick Carlson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carlson:Patrick", "Stephen B.
