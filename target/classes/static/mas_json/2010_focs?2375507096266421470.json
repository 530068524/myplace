Our algorithms can be extended to some kernelized versions of these problems, such as SVDD, hard margin SVM, and  L  2 -SVM, for which sublinear-time algorithms were not known before. These new algorithms use a combination of a novel sampling techniques and a new multiplicative update algorithm. We give lower bounds which show the running times of many of our algorithms to be nearly best possible in the unit-cost RAM model.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["IBM", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "IBM", "IBM", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "IBM"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Kenneth L.
