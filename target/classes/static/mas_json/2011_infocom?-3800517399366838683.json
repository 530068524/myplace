{"title": "Achieving congestion diversity in wireless ad-hoc networks.", "fields": ["link state routing protocol", "end to end delay", "throughput", "backpressure routing", "interior gateway protocol"], "abstract": "This work presents the Congestion Diversity Protocol (CDP), a routing protocol for multi-hop wireless networks that combines important aspects of shortest-path and backpressure routing to achieve improved end-end delay performance. In particular, CDP delivers lower end-to-end delay and fewer packet drops than existing routing protocols while maintaining equivalent throughput. This paper reports on a practical (hardware and software) implementation of CDP in an indoor WiFi network consisting of 12 802.11g nodes. This small test-bed enables an imperical comparison of CDP's performance against a set of state of the art protocols which include both congestion unaware and congestion aware routing protocols. In most topologies and scenarios we consider, CDP provides improvements for UDP traffic with respect to both end-end delay and throughput over the existing protocols.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Abhijeet Bhorkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhorkar:Abhijeet", "Tara Javidi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Javidi:Tara", "Alex C.
