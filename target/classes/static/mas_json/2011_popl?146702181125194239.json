In order to handle common distributed interaction patterns such as peer-to-peer protocols or cloud algorithms, we propose a new role-based multiparty session type theory where roles are defined as classes of local behaviours that an arbitrary number of participants can dynamically join and leave. We offer programmers a polling operation that gives access to the current set of a role's participants in order to fork processes. Our type system with universal types for polling can handle this dynamism and retain type safety. A multiparty locking mechanism is introduced to provide communication safety, but also to ensure a stronger progress property for joining participants that has never been guaranteed in previous systems. Finally, we present some implementation mechanisms used in our prototype extension of ML.", "citation": "Citations (118)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Pierre-Malo Deni\u00e9lou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deni=eacute=lou:Pierre=Malo", "Nobuko Yoshida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshida:Nobuko"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
