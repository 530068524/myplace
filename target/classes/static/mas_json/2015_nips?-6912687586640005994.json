In particular, we make two contributions: (i) For parameter estimation, we propose a novel high dimensional EM algorithm which naturally incorporates sparsity structure into parameter estimation. With an appropriate initialization, this algorithm converges at a geometric rate and attains an estimator with the (near-)optimal statistical rate of convergence. (ii) Based on the obtained estimator, we propose a new inferential procedure for testing hypotheses for low dimensional components of high dimensional parameters. For a broad family of statistical models, our framework establishes the first computationally feasible approach for optimal estimation and asymptotic inference in high dimensions.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of Virginia", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zhaoran Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhaoran", "Quanquan Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Quanquan", "Yang Ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ning:Yang", "Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Han"], "pages": 9}
