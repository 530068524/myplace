{"title": "Entity Matching across Heterogeneous Sources.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "machine learning", "unified model", "topic model", "leverage"], "abstract": "Given an entity in a source domain, finding its matched entities from another (target) domain is an important task in many applications. Traditionally, the problem was usually addressed by first extracting major keywords corresponding to the source entity and then query relevant entities from the target domain using those keywords. However, the method would inevitably fails if the two domains have less or no overlapping in the content. An extreme case is that the source domain is in English and the target domain is in Chinese.   In this paper, we formalize the problem as entity matching across heterogeneous sources and propose a probabilistic topic model to solve the problem. The model integrates the topic extraction and entity matching, two core subtasks for dealing with the problem, into a unified model. Specifically, for handling the text disjointing problem, we use a cross-sampling process in our model to extract topics with terms coming from all the sources, and leverage existing matching relations through latent topic layers instead of at text layers. Benefit from the proposed model, we can not only find the matched documents for a query entity, but also explain why these documents are related by showing the common topics they share. Our experiments in two real-world applications show that the proposed model can extensively improve the matching performance (+19.8% and +7.1% in two applications respectively) compared with several alternative methods.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Northeastern University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0009:Yang", "Yizhou Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yizhou", "Jie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Jie", "Bo Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Bo", "Juan-Zi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Juan=Zi"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
