{"title": "Video acuity assessment in mobile devices.", "fields": ["subjective video quality", "quality of experience", "end user", "video quality", "pevq"], "abstract": "The quality of mobile videos is usually quantified through the Quality of Experience (QoE), which is usually based on network QoS measurements, user engagement, or post-view subjective scores. Such quantifications are not adequate for real-time evaluation. They cannot provide on-line feedback for improvement of visual acuity, which represents the actual viewing experience of the end user. We present a visual acuity framework which makes fast online computations in a mobile device and provide an accurate estimate of mobile video QoE. We identify and study the three main causes that impact visual acuity in mobile videos: spatial distortions, types of buffering and resolution changes. Each of them can be accurately modeled using our framework. We use machine learning techniques to build a prediction model for visual acuity, which depicts more than 78% accuracy. We present an experimental implementation on iPhone 4 and 5s to show that the proposed visual acuity framework is feasible to deploy in mobile devices. Using a data corpus of over 2852 mobile video clips for the experiments, we validate the proposed framework.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Univerisity of  ... lifornia, Davis", "Univerisity of  ... lifornia, Davis", "Univerisity of  ... lifornia, Davis", "Univerisity of  ... lifornia, Davis"], "authors": ["Eilwoo Baik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baik:Eilwoo", "Amit Pande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pande:Amit", "Chris Stover.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stover:Chris", "Prasant Mohapatra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohapatra:Prasant"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
