Crowdsourced Translation via a Two-Step Collaboration of Non-Professional Translators and Editors.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "ranking", "training set", "data mining", "machine translation"], "abstract": "Crowdsourcing is a viable mechanism for creating training data for machine translation. It provides a low cost, fast turnaround way of processing large volumes of data. However, when compared to professional translation, naive collection of translations from non-professionals yields low-quality results. Careful quality control is necessary for crowdsourcing to work well. In this paper, we examine the challenges of a two-step collaboration process with translation and post-editing by non-professionals. We develop graphbased ranking models that automatically select the best output from multiple redundant versions of translations and edits, and improves translation quality closer to professionals.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Rui Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Rui", "Mingkun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Mingkun", "Ellie Pavlick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pavlick:Ellie", "Chris Callison-Burch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Callison=Burch:Chris"], "pages": 11}
