{"title": "Deconvolutional networks.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "deconvolution", "feature detection", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Building robust low and mid-level image representations, beyond edge primitives, is a long-standing goal in vision. Many existing feature detectors spatially pool edge information which destroys cues such as edge intersections, parallelism and symmetry. We present a learning framework where features that capture these mid-level cues spontaneously emerge from image data. Our approach is based on the convolutional decomposition of images under a spar-sity constraint and is totally unsupervised. By building a hierarchy of such decompositions we can learn rich feature sets that are a robust image representation for both the analysis and synthesis of images.", "citation": "Citations (672)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Matthew D.
