The technique is an amalgam of SAT-solving, where a propositional formula is used to encode the semantics of a basic block, and abstraction, where the solutions to the formula are systematically combined and summarised as a system of congruence equations. The resulting technique is more precise than existing congruence analyses since a single optimal transfer function is derived for a basic block as a whole.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "Portcullis Comp ... er, UK HA5 2EX"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Andy King.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/King:Andy", "Harald S\u00f8ndergaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=oslash=ndergaard:Harald"], "pages": 13}
