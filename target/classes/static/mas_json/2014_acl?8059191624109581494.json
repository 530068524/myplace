This paper introduces the problem of predicting instructor interventions in MOOC forums. We propose several prediction models designed to capture unique aspects of MOOCs, combining course information, forum structure and posts content. Our models abstract contents of individual posts of threads using latent categories, learned jointly with the binary intervention prediction problem. Experiments over data from two Coursera MOOCs demonstrate that incorporating the structure of threads into the learning problem leads to better predictive performance.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Snigdha Chaturvedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaturvedi:Snigdha", "Dan Goldwasser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldwasser:Dan", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "pages": 11}
