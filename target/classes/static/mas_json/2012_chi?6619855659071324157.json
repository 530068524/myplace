{"title": "MOSOCO: a mobile assistive tool to support children with autism practicing social skills in real-life situations.", "fields": ["social group", "augmented reality", "social skills", "social competence", "neurotypical"], "abstract": "MOSOCO is a mobile assistive application that uses augmented reality and the visual supports of a validated curriculum, the Social Compass, to help children with autism practice social skills in real-life situations. In this paper, we present the results of a seven-week deployment study of MOSOCO in a public school in Southern California with both students with autism and neurotypical students. The results of our study demonstrate that MOSOCO facilitates practicing and learning social skills, increases both quantity and quality of social interactions, reduces social and behavioral missteps, and enables the integration of children with autism in social groups of neurotypical children. The findings from this study reveal emergent practices of the uses of mobile assistive technologies in real-life situations.", "citation": "Citations (129)", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Baja California", "Nokia", "University of California, Irvine", "Autonomous University of Baja California", "NOC SELPA, Full ... , United States"], "authors": ["Lizbeth Escobedo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Escobedo:Lizbeth", "David H.
