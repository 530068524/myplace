We introduce different levels of eviction, namely, query-, resource- and entry-level, based on the granularity of the entries to be evicted from the cache when it is full. We also propose a novel entry-level caching approach that is tailored for the meta-search scenario and superior to alternative approaches.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Middle East Technical University", "Middle East Technical University", "Middle East Technical University"], "authors": ["Emre Bakkal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bakkal:Emre", "Ismail Sengor Altingovde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altingovde:Ismail_Sengor", "Ismail Hakki Toroslu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toroslu:Ismail_Hakki"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
