In this paper, we consider data-intensive workloads with precedence constraints arising from data dependencies. While there has been previous work on identifying common subexpressions and task re-ordering to enable shared scans, in this paper we solve the problem of scheduling shared data-intensive workloads in a cache-oblivious way. Our solution relies on a novel formulation of precedence constrained scheduling with the additional constraint that once a data item is in the cache, all tasks that require this item should execute as soon as possible thereafter. We give an optimal algorithm using A* search over the space of possible orderings, and we propose efficient and effective heuristics that obtain nearly-optimal schedules in much less time. We present experimental results on real-life data warehouse workloads and the TCP-DS benchmark to validate our claims.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Telecommunicati ...
