{"title": "Variational Inference for Mahalanobis Distance Metrics in Gaussian Process Regression.", "fields": ["latent variable model", "hyperparameter", "mahalanobis distance", "kriging", "variational method"], "abstract": "We introduce a novel variational method that allows to approximately integrate out kernel hyperparameters, such as length-scales, in Gaussian process regression. This approach consists of a novel variant of the variational framework that has been recently developed for the Gaussian process latent variable model which additionally makes use of a standardised representation of the Gaussian process. We consider this technique for learning Mahalanobis distance metrics in a Gaussian process regression setting and provide experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing methods by considering datasets with high-dimensional inputs.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Athens University of Economics and Business", "Charles III University of Madrid"], "authors": ["Michalis K.
