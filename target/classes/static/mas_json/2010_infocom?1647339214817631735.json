We identify the data-fusion range as a key factor that enables effective cooperative sensing for detection of small-scale primary devices. In particular, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal data-fusion range that minimizes the average detection delay. We also observe that the sensing performance is sensitive to the accuracy in estimating the primary's location and transmit-power. Based on these observations, we propose an efficient sensing framework, called DeLOC, that iteratively performs location/transmit-power estimation and dynamic sensor selection for cooperative sensing. Our extensive simulation results in a realistic CRN environment show that DeLOC achieves near-optimal detection performance, while meeting the detection requirements specified in the IEEE 802.22 standard draft.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Alexander W.
