{"title": "Creating a manually error-tagged and shallow-parsed learner corpus.", "fields": ["chunking", "shallow parsing", "test set", "annotation", "automated essay scoring"], "abstract": "The availability of learner corpora, especially those which have been manually error-tagged or shallow-parsed, is still limited. This means that researchers do not have a common development and test set for natural language processing of learner English such as for grammatical error detection. Given this background, we created a novel learner corpus that was manually error-tagged and shallow-parsed. This corpus is available for research and educational purposes on the web. In this paper, we describe it in detail together with its data-collection method and annotation schemes. Another contribution of this paper is that we take the first step toward evaluating the performance of existing POS-tagging/chunking techniques on learner corpora using the created corpus. These contributions will facilitate further research in related areas such as grammatical error detection and automated essay scoring.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Konan University", "The Japan Insti ... , Tokyo, Japan", "The Japan Insti ... , Tokyo, Japan"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ryo Nagata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagata:Ryo", "Edward W.
