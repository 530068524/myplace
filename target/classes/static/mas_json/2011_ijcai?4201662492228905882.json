{"title": "Learning Decision Rules from Data Streams.", "fields": ["data mining", "decision rule", "interpretability", "data stream mining", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Decision rules, which can provide good interpretability and flexibility for data mining tasks, have received very little attention in the stream mining community so far. In this work we introduce a new algorithm to learn rule sets, designed for open-ended data streams. The proposed algorithm is able to continuously learn compact ordered and unordered rule sets. The experimental evaluation shows competitive results in comparison with VFDT and C4.5rules.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Porto", "Masaryk University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jo\u00e3o Gama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gama:Jo=atilde=o", "Petr Kosina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosina:Petr"], "pages": 6}
