In this paper, we present an empirical study of a representative aggregate judgment task: finding regions of maximum average in a series. We show how a theory of perceptual averaging suggests a visual design other than the typically-used line graph. We describe an experiment that assesses participants' ability to estimate averages and make judgments based on these averages. The experiment confirms that this color encoding significantly outperforms the standard practice. The experiment also provides evidence for a perceptual averaging theory.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Northwestern University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Michael Correll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Correll:Michael", "Danielle Albers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albers:Danielle", "Steven Franconeri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Franconeri:Steven", "Michael Gleicher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gleicher:Michael"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
