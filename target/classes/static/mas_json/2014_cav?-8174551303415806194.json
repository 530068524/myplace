{"title": "A Conference Management System with Verified Document Confidentiality.", "fields": ["safety property", "computer security model", "confidentiality", "conference management", "epistemic modal logic"], "abstract": "We present a case study in verified security for realistic systems: the implementation of a conference management system, whose functional kernel is faithfully represented in the Isabelle theorem prover, where we specify and verify confidentiality properties. The various theoretical and practical challenges posed by this development led to a novel security model and verification method generally applicable to systems describable as input\u0097output automata.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Sudeep Kanav.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanav:Sudeep", "Peter Lammich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lammich:Peter", "Andrei Popescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popescu_0001:Andrei"], "pages": 17}
