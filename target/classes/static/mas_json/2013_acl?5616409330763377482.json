Being able to automatically identify, from a corpus of monolingual text, which word tokens are being used in a previously unseen sense has applications to machine translation and other tasks sensitive to lexical semantics. We define a task, SENSESPOTTING, in which we build systems to spot tokens that have new senses in new domain text. Instead of difficult and expensive annotation, we build a goldstandard by leveraging cheaply available parallel corpora, targeting our approach to the problem of domain adaptation for machine translation. Our system is able to achieve F-measures of as much as 80%, when applied to word types it has never seen before. Our approach is based on a large set of novel features that capture varied aspects of how words change when used in new domains.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["National Research Council", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Chicago", "Johns Hopkins University", "IBM"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Marine Carpuat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carpuat:Marine", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal", "Katharine Henry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henry:Katharine", "Ann Irvine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irvine:Ann", "Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jagarlamudi:Jagadeesh", "Rachel Rudinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudinger:Rachel"], "pages": 11}
