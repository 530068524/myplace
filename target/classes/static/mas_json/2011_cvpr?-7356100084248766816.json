Previous work of quadratic Maha-lanobis metric learning usually needs to solve a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. A standard interior-point SDP solver has a complexity of O(D 6.5 ) (with D the dimension of input data), and can only solve problems up to a few thousand variables. Since the number of variables is D(D + l)/2, this corresponds to a limit around D  3 ) with t \u2248 20 \u223c 30 for most problems in our experiments. The proposed algorithm is scalable and easy to implement. Experiments on various datasets show its similar accuracy compared with state-of-the-art. We also demonstrate that this idea may also be able to be applied to other SDP problems such as maximum variance unfolding.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "NICTA", "Australian National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chunhua Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chunhua", "Junae Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Junae", "Lei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Lei"], "pages": 8}
