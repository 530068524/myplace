However, existing algorithms are not applied to large graphs because they have to scan all vertices/edges iteratively. The goal of this paper is to efficiently compute clusters with high modularity from extremely large graphs with more than a few billion edges. The heart of our solution is to compute clusters by incrementally pruning unnecessary vertices/edges and optimizing the order of vertex selections. Our experiments show that our proposal outperforms all other modularity-based algorithms in terms of computation time, and it finds clusters with high modularity.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["NTT Software In ... , Tokyo, Japan", "NTT Software In ... , Tokyo, Japan", "NTT Software In ... , Tokyo, Japan"], "authors": ["Hiroaki Shiokawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shiokawa:Hiroaki", "Yasuhiro Fujiwara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujiwara:Yasuhiro", "Makoto Onizuka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onizuka:Makoto"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
