We replay realistic application traces to these ORAMs in order to understand whether they can meet the demands of various real applications using cloud storage as a backend. We find that metrics traditionally used in the ORAM literature, e.g., bandwidth overhead, fail to capture the practical needs of those applications. With a new understanding of the desirable properties, relevant metrics, and observations about the cloud services and their applications, we propose CURIOUS, a new modular partition-based ORAM framework, and show experimentally that it is thus far the most promising approach.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Vincent Bindschaedler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bindschaedler:Vincent", "Muhammad Naveed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naveed_0001:Muhammad", "Xiaorui Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Xiaorui", "XiaoFeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:XiaoFeng", "Yan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Yan"], "pages": 13}
