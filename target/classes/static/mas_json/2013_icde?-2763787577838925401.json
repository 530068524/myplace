While commercial database systems provide mechanisms such as triggers that can be used to track and log any changes made to \u201csensitive\u201d data using UPDATE queries, they are not useful for tracking accesses to sensitive data using complex SQL queries, which is important for many applications given recent laws such as HIPAA. In this paper, we propose the notion of SELECT triggers that extends triggers to work for SELECT queries in order to facilitate data auditing. We discuss the challenges in integrating SELECT triggers in a database system including specification, semantics as well as efficient implementation techniques. We have prototyped our framework in a commercial database system and present an experimental evaluation of our framework using the TPC-H benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Daniel Fabbri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fabbri:Daniel", "Ravishankar Ramamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramamurthy:Ravishankar", "Raghav Kaushik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaushik:Raghav"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
