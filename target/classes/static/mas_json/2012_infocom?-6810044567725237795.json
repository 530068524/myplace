However, the sleep latency brought by duty cycling mode results in significant rise on the delivery latency. In order to reduce unnecessary forwarding interruption, the state-of-the-art has proposed pipeline scheduling technique by allocating sequential wakeup time slots along the forwarding path. We experimentally show that previously proposed pipeline is fragile and ineffective in reality when wireless communication links are unreliable. To overcome such challenges and improve the performance on the delivery latency, we propose Robust Multi-pipeline Scheduling (RMS) algorithm to coordinate multiple parallel pipelines and switch the packet timely among different pipelines if failure happens in former attempts of transmissions. RMS combines the pipeline features with the advantages brought by multi-parents forwarding. Large-scale simulations and testbed implementations verify that the end-to-end delivery latency can be reduced by 40% through exploiting multi-pipeline scheduled forwarding path with tolerable energy overhead.", "citation": "Citations (41)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Yongle Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yongle", "Shuo Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Shuo", "Tian He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Tian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
