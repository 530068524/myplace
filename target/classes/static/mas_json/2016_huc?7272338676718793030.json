To address the challenges, we present our system named MaTrack, which is implemented on commodity off-the-shelf Intel 5300 Wi-Fi cards. MaTrack proposes a novel Dynamic-MUSIC method to detect the subtle reflection signals from human body and further differentiate them from those reflected signals from static objects (furniture, walls, etc.) to identify the human target's angle for localization. MaTrack does not require any offline training compared to existing signature-based systems and is insensitive to changes in environment. With just two receivers, MaTrack is able to achieve a median localization accuracy below 0.6 m when the human is walking, outperforming the state-of-the-art schemes.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Singapore Management University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Xiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiang", "Shengjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shengjie", "Daqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Daqing", "Jie Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong_0001:Jie", "Yasha Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yasha", "Hong Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Hong"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
