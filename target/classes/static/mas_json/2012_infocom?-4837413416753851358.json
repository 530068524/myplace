In this paper, we investigate the problem of efficient scheduling in mmWave wireless personal area networks (WPAN). We develop a frame-based scheduling directional MAC protocol, termed FDMAC, to achieve the goal of leveraging collision-free concurrent transmissions to fully exploit spatial reuse in mmWave WPANs. The high efficiency of FDMAC is achieved by amortizing the scheduling overhead over multiple concurrent, back-to-back transmissions in a row. The core of FDMAC is a graph coloring-based scheduling algorithm, termed greedy coloring (GC) algorithm, that can compute near-optimal schedules with respect to the total transmission time with low complexity. The proposed FDMAC is analyzed and evaluated under various traffic models and patterns. Its superior performance is validated with extensive simulations.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "departments": ["Defense Acquisition Program Administration", "Auburn University", "Intel", "Auburn University"], "authors": ["In Keun Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:In_Keun", "Shiwen Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Shiwen", "Michelle X.
