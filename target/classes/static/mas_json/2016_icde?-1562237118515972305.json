However, there is a lack of analytical information that allows users to understand and tune the probability of time-varying result tuples. In this demonstration, we present TemProRA, a system that focuses on the analysis of the top-k temporal probabilistic results of a query. We propose the Temporal Probabilistic Lineage Tree (TPLT), the Temporal Probabilistic Bubble Chart (TPBC) and the Temporal Probabilistic Column Chart (TPCC): for each output tuple these three tools are created to provide the user with the most important information to systematically modify the time-varying probability of result tuples. The effectiveness and usefulness of TemProRA are demonstrated through queries performed on a dataset created based on data from Migros, the leading Swiss supermarket branch.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "University of Zurich"], "authors": ["Katerina Papaioannou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papaioannou:Katerina", "Michael H.
