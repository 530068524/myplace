We analyze the precise relationship between L_\\le and p-Acc_\\le. We show that p-Acc_\\le is not fixed-parameter tractable if ``P \\ne NP holds for all time constructible and increasing functions.'' Moreover, a slightly stronger complexity theoretic hypothesis implies that L_\\le does not capture polynomial time. Furthermore, we analyze the complexity of various variants of p-Acc_\\le and address its construction problem.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of Freiburg", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of Freiburg", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of Freiburg"], "authors": ["Yijia Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yijia", "J\u00f6rg Flum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flum:J=ouml=rg"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
