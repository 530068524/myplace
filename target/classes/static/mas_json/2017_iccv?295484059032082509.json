Existing machine learning approaches fail to generalize in the same way. To make progress on this foundational problem, we present a low-shot learning benchmark on complex images that mimics challenges faced by recognition systems in the wild. We then propose (1) representation regularization techniques, and (2) techniques to hallucinate additional training examples for data-starved classes. Together, our methods improve the effectiveness of convolutional networks in low-shot learning, improving the one-shot accuracy on novel classes by 2.3\u00d7 on the challenging ImageNet dataset.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Bharath Hariharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hariharan:Bharath", "Ross B.
