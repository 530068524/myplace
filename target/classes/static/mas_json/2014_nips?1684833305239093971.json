{"title": "General Table Completion using a Bayesian Nonparametric Model.", "fields": ["feature model", "categorical variable", "nonparametric statistics", "ordinal number", "probabilistic logic"], "abstract": "Even though heterogeneous databases can be found in a broad variety of applications, there exists a lack of tools for estimating missing data in such databases. In this paper, we provide an efficient and robust table completion tool, based on a Bayesian nonparametric latent feature model. In particular, we propose a general observation model for the Indian buffet process (IBP) adapted to mixed continuous (real-valued and positive real-valued) and discrete (categorical, ordinal and count) observations. Then, we propose an inference algorithm that scales linearly with the number of observations. Finally, our experiments over five real databases show that the proposed approach provides more robust and accurate estimates than the standard IBP and the Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization with Gaussian observations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carlos III Health Institute", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Isabel Valera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valera:Isabel", "Zoubin Ghahramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghahramani:Zoubin"], "pages": 9}
