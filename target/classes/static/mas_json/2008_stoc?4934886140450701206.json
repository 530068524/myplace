We present a polynomial-time blockwise reduction algorithm based on duality which can similarly be viewed as an algorithmic version of Mordell's inequality on Hermite's constant. This achieves a better and more natural approximation factor for the shortest vector problem than Schnorr's algorithm and its transference variant by Gama, Howgrave-Graham, Koy and Nguyen. Furthermore, we show that this approximation factor is essentially tight in the worst case.", "citation": "Citations (115)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Nicolas Gama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gama:Nicolas", "Phong Q.
