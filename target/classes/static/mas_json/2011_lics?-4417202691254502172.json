{"title": "Two Views on Multiple Mean-Payoff Objectives in Markov Decision Processes.", "fields": ["pareto distribution", "decision problem", "stochastic game", "discrete mathematics", "polynomial", "mathematics", "markov decision process"], "abstract": "We study Markov decision processes (MDPs) with multiple limit-average (or mean-payoff) functions. We consider two different objectives, namely, expectation and satisfaction objectives. Given an MDP with k reward functions, in the expectation objective the goal is to maximize the expected limit-average value, and in the satisfaction objective the goal is to maximize the probability of runs such that the limit-average value stays above a given vector. We show that under the expectation objective, in contrast to the single-objective case, both randomization and memory are necessary for strategies, and that finite-memory randomized strategies are sufficient. Under the satisfaction objective, in contrast to the single-objective case, infinite memory is necessary for strategies, and that randomized memoryless strategies are sufficient for epsilon-approximation, for all epsilon>0. We further prove that the decision problems for both expectation and satisfaction objectives can be solved in polynomial time and the trade-off curve (Pareto curve) can be epsilon-approximated in time polynomial in the size of the MDP and 1/epsilon, and exponential in the number of reward functions, for all epsilon>0. Our results also reveal flaws in previous work for MDPs with multiple mean-payoff functions under the expectation objective, correct the flaws and obtain improved results.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Masaryk University", "University of Edinburgh", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "University of Oxford", "Masaryk University"], "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s Br\u00e1zdil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Br=aacute=zdil:Tom=aacute=s", "V\u00e1clav Brozek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brozek:V=aacute=clav", "Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Vojtech Forejt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forejt:Vojtech", "Anton\u00edn Kucera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kucera:Anton=iacute=n"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
