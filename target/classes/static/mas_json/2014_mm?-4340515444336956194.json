This paper proposes a mobile video delivery system to emphasize the use of acceptability as the main indicator of QoE to manage the end-to-end factors in delivering mobile video services. The first contribution is a novel framework for user-centric mobile video system that is based on acceptability-based QoE (A-QoE) prediction models, which were derived from comprehensive subjective studies. The second contribution is results from a field study that evaluates the user experience of the proposed system during realistic usage circumstances, addressing the impacts of perceived video quality, loading speed, interest in content, viewing locations, network bandwidth, display devices, and different video coding approaches, including region-of-interest (ROI) enhancement and center zooming.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology"], "authors": ["We Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:We", "Dian Tjondronegoro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tjondronegoro:Dian", "Ivan Himawan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Himawan:Ivan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
