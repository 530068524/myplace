{"title": "Video browsing by direct manipulation.", "fields": ["interactivity", "video browsing", "multimedia", "computer vision", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "We present a method for browsing videos by directly dragging their content. This method brings the benefits of direct manipulation to an activity typically mediated by widgets. We support this new type of interactivity by: 1) automatically extracting motion data from videos; and 2) a new technique called  relative flow dragging  that lets users control video playback by moving objects of interest along their visual trajectory. We show that this method can outperform the traditional seeker bar in video browsing tasks that focus on visual content rather than time.", "citation": "Citations (140)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Pierre Dragicevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dragicevic:Pierre", "Gonzalo Ramos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramos:Gonzalo", "Jacobo Bibliowicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bibliowicz:Jacobo", "Derek Nowrouzezahrai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nowrouzezahrai:Derek", "Ravin Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Ravin", "Karan Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Karan"], "pages": 10}
