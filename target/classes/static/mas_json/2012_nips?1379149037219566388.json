We develop a novel algorithm based on the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method, that can simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence rates for both convex and strongly convex loss. In particular, for strongly convex loss, it achieves the optimal rate of O(1/N + 1/N2) for N iterations, which improves the rate O(log N/N) for previous regularized dual averaging algorithms. In addition, our method constructs the final solution directly from the proximal mapping instead of averaging of all previous iterates. For widely used sparsity-inducing regularizers (e.g., l1-norm), it has the advantage of encouraging sparser solutions. We further develop a multistage extension using the proposed algorithm as a subroutine, which achieves the uniformly-optimal rate O(1/N | exp{\u2013 N}) for strongly convex loss.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xi", "Qihang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Qihang", "Javier Pe\u00f1a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pe=ntilde=a:Javier"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
