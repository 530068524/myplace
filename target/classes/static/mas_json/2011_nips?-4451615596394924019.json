{"title": "k-NN Regression Adapts to Local Intrinsic Dimension.", "fields": ["minkowski bouligand dimension", "effective dimension", "intrinsic dimension", "minimax", "dimension function"], "abstract": "Many nonparametric regressors were recently shown to converge at rates that depend only on the intrinsic dimension of data. These regressors thus escape the curse of dimension when high-dimensional data has low intrinsic dimension (e.g. a manifold). We show that k-NN regression is also adaptive to intrinsic dimension. In particular our rates are local to a query x and depend only on the way masses of balls centered at x vary with radius.\n\nFurthermore, we show a simple way to choose k = k(x) locally at any x so as to nearly achieve the minimax rate at x in terms of the unknown intrinsic dimension in the vicinity of x. We also establish that the minimax rate does not depend on a particular choice of metric space or distribution, but rather that this minimax rate holds for any metric space and doubling measure.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Samory Kpotufe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kpotufe:Samory"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
