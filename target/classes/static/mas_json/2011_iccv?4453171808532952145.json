Single or stereo camera based solutions are sensitive to refraction distortions, fast fluid motions, and calibration errors. In this paper, we present a multi-view based solution for robustly capturing fast evolving fluid wavefronts. We first construct a portable, 3\u00d73 camera array system as the main acquisition device. We elaborately design the system to allow high-resolution and high-speed capture. To recover fluid surfaces, we place a known pattern beneath the surface and position the camera array on top to observe the pattern. By tracking the distorted feature points over time and across cameras, we obtain spatial-temporal correspondence maps and we use them for specular carving to reconstruct the time-varying surface. In case one of the cameras loses track due to distortions or blurs, we use the rest of the cameras to construct the surface and then apply multi-perspective warping to locate the lost-track feature points so that we can continue using the camera in later frames. Our experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that our multi-view framework is robust and reliable.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Delaware", "University of Delaware", "University of Delaware", "University of Delaware"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yuanyuan Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Yuanyuan", "Feng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Feng", "Yu Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Yu", "Jingyi Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jingyi"], "pages": 8}
