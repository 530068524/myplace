{"title": "Tweets are forever: a large-scale quantitative analysis of deleted tweets.", "fields": ["empirical research", "internet privacy", "vocabulary", "geotagging", "social network"], "abstract": "This paper describes an empirical study of 1.6M deleted tweets collected over a continuous one-week period from a set of 292K Twitter users. We examine several aggregate properties of deleted tweets, including their connections to other tweets (e.g., whether they are replies or retweets), the clients used to produce them, temporal aspects of deletion, and the presence of geotagging information. Some significant differences were discovered between the two collections, namely in the clients used to post them, their conversational aspects, the sentiment vocabulary present in them, and the days of the week they were posted. However, in other dimensions for which analysis was possible, no substantial differences were found. Finally, we discuss some ramifications of this work for understanding Twitter usage and management of one's privacy.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Hazim Almuhimedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Almuhimedi:Hazim", "Shomir Wilson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilson:Shomir", "Bin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0017:Bin", "Norman M.
