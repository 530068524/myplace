{"title": "Parallel Fast Gauss Transform.", "fields": ["kernel", "gaussian function", "parallel algorithm", "binary logarithm", "massively parallel"], "abstract": "We present fast adaptive parallel algorithms to compute the sum of N Gaussians at N points. Direct sequential computation of this sum would take $O(N^2)$ time. The parallel time complexity estimates for our algorithms are $O(N/np)$ for uniform point distributions and $O(N/np log N/np + nplognp)$ for nonuniform distributions using np CPUs. We incorporate a planewave representation of the Gaussian kernel which permits \u201cdiagonal translation\u201d. We use parallel octrees and a new scheme for translating the plane-waves to efficiently handle nonuniform distributions. Computing the transform to six-digit accuracy at 120 billion points took approximately 140 seconds using 4096 cores on the Jaguar supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Our implementation is kernel-independent and can handle other \u201cGaussian-type\u201d kernels even when an explicit analytic expression for the kernel is not known. These algorithms form a new class of core computational machinery for solving parabolic PDEs on massively parallel architectures.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Princeton University", "New York University"], "authors": ["Rahul S.
