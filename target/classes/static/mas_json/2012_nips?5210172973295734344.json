{"title": "Bayesian models for Large-scale Hierarchical Classification.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "bayesian probability", "inference", "logistic regression", "scalability"], "abstract": "A challenging problem in hierarchical classification is to leverage the hierarchical relations among classes for improving classification performance. An even greater challenge is to do so in a manner that is computationally feasible for large scale problems. This paper proposes a set of Bayesian methods to model hierarchical dependencies among class labels using multivariate logistic regression. Specifically, the parent-child relationships are modeled by placing a hierarchical prior over the children nodes centered around the parameters of their parents; thereby encouraging classes nearby in the hierarchy to share similar model parameters. We present variational algorithms for tractable posterior inference in these models, and provide a parallel implementation that can comfortably handle large-scale problems with hundreds of thousands of dimensions and tens of thousands of classes. We run a comparative evaluation on multiple large-scale benchmark datasets that highlights the scalability of our approach and shows improved performance over the other state-of-the-art hierarchical methods.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Siddharth Gopal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopal:Siddharth", "Yiming Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yiming", "Bing Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Bing", "Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niculescu=Mizil:Alexandru"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
