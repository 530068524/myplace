This observation motivates a precision-based approach to acceleration which takes into account both the computational structure and the required numerical precision representation. This work presents  Stripes  ( STR ), a hardware accelerator that uses bit-serial computations to improve energy efficiency and performance. Experimental measurements over a set of state-of-the-art DNNs for image classification show that  STR  improves performance over a state-of-the-art accelerator from 1.35  $\\times$      \u00a0to 5.33   $\\times$      \u00a0and by 2.24  $\\times$      \u00a0on average.  STR \u2019s area and power overhead are estimated at 5 percent and 12 percent respectively.   STR  is 2.00  $\\times$      \u00a0more energy efficient than the baseline.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Patrick Judd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Judd:Patrick", "Jorge Albericio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albericio:Jorge", "Tayler H.
