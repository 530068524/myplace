It is designed so that the Taylor expansion within it coincides with the interpretation by generalised species of Fiore et al., which generalises both Joyal's combinatorial species and Girard's normal functors, and which can be seen as a proof-relevant extension of the relational model. As an application, we prove the commutation between computing Bohm trees and (standard) Taylor expansions for a particular nondeterministic calculus.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Takeshi Tsukada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsukada:Takeshi", "Kazuyuki Asada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asada:Kazuyuki", "C.-H.
