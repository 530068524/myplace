Today, this process tends to be largely manual because existing tools cannot easily evolve with the network. We present CueT, a system that uses interactive machine learning to learn from the triaging decisions of operators. It then uses that learning in novel visualizations to help them quickly and accurately triage alarms. Unlike prior interactive machine learning systems, CueT handles a highly dynamic environment where the groups of interest are not known a-priori and evolve constantly. A user study with real operators and data from a large network shows that CueT significantly improves the speed and accuracy of alarm triage compared to the network's current practice.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Saleema Amershi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amershi:Saleema", "Bongshin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Bongshin", "Ashish Kapoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapoor:Ashish", "Ratul Mahajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahajan:Ratul", "Blaine Christian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Christian:Blaine"], "pages": 10}
