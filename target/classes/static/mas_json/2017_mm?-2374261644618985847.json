A key feature is that the system is very simple to rapidly deploy, with autonomous calibration and requiring minimal intervention from the user, other than casually placing the cameras. This system is realized through three technical contributions: (1) a fully automatic calibration method, which analyzes and correlates the left and right RGBD faces just by the face features; (2) an implementation that exploits the parallel computation capability of GPU throughout most of the system pipeline, in order to attain real-time performance; and (3) a complete integrated system on which we conducted various experiments to demonstrate its capability, robustness, and performance, including testing the system on twelve participants with visually-pleasing results.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Fuwen Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Fuwen", "Chi-Wing Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Chi=Wing", "Teng Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Teng", "Jianfei Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Jianfei", "Tat-Jen Cham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cham:Tat=Jen"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
