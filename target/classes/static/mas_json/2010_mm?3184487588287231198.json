This is a audio-visual corpus containing natural conversational data of volunteers who took part in a competitive role-playing game. Four groups of 8-12 people were recorded. In total, just over 7 hours of interactive conversational data was collected. The data has been annotated in terms of the roles and outcomes of the game. There are 371 examples of different roles played over 50 games. Recordings were made with headset microphones, an 8-microphone array, and 3 video cameras and are fully synchronised. The novelty of this data is that some players have deceptive roles and the participants do not know what roles other people play.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "Idiap Research Institute"], "authors": ["Hayley Hung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hung:Hayley", "Gokul Chittaranjan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chittaranjan:Gokul"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
