Materials and Methods: All 23 subjects (16 men, seven women; mean age, 54 years \u00b1 13 [standard deviation]) provided written informed consent; the study was approved by the local institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. A high-spatial-resolution free-breathing delayed enhancement MR imaging method was developed to detect scar (ie, ablated tissue) in the LA and pulmonary veins (PVs). The LA in 15 patients before ablation and in 18 patients at least 30 days after ablation was examined. A reader with 4 years of experience assessed presence of delayed enhancement on images and circumferential completeness. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were measured and compared with an unpaired t test. The relationship between measurements of enhancement thic...", "citation": "Citations (293)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Siemens", "Max Planck Society", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "Loughborough University", "University of Leicester", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Biomedical Engi ... ring Department", "Department of D ... eiburg, Germany", "Department of N ... eiburg, Germany", "Department of D ... eiburg, Germany", "Department of D ... eiburg, Germany", "Department of D ... eiburg, Germany", "Croy, Clemens ( ... t, D-60323, DE)", "Croy, Clemens ( ... t, D-60323, DE)", "Shavano Park, USA"], "conf": "siggraph", "authors": ["Jorn Ebner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ebner:Jorn"], "pages": 1}
