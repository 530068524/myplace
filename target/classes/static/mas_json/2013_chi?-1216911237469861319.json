Developing usable software systems for people with complex disabilities is problematic, software developers are wary of using user-centred design, one of the main methods by which usability can be improved, due to concerns about how best to work with adults with complex disabilities, in particular Severe Speech and Physical Impairments (SSPI) and how to involve them in research. This paper reports on how the adoption of an adapted agile approach involving the incorporation of a user advocate on the research team helped in meeting this challenge in one software project and offers suggestions for how this could be used by other development teams.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Abertay University", "University of Dundee", "University of Dundee", "University of Dundee"], "authors": ["Suzanne Prior.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prior:Suzanne", "Annalu Waller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waller:Annalu", "Rolf Black.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Black:Rolf", "Thilo Kroll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kroll:Thilo"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
