First, we perform crowd-sourced human studies to find a taxonomy of 102 discriminative attributes. Next, we build the \u201cSUN attribute database\u201d on top of the diverse SUN categorical database. Our attribute database spans more than 700 categories and 14,000 images and has potential for use in high-level scene understanding and fine-grained scene recognition. We use our dataset to train attribute classifiers and evaluate how well these relatively simple classifiers can recognize a variety of attributes related to materials, surface properties, lighting, functions and affordances, and spatial envelope properties.", "citation": "Citations (322)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Genevieve Patterson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patterson:Genevieve", "James Hays.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hays:James"], "pages": 8}
