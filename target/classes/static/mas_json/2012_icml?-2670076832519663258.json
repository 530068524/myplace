In this paper, we introduce efficient online algorithms based on the alternating directions method (ADM). We introduce a new proof technique for ADM in the batch setting, which yields the O(1/T) convergence rate of ADM and forms the basis of regret analysis in the online setting. We consider two scenarios in the online setting, based on whether the solution needs to lie in the feasible set or not. In both settings, we establish regret bounds for both the objective function as well as constraint violation for general and strongly convex functions. Preliminary results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (153)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Huahua Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huahua", "Arindam Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Arindam"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
