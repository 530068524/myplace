This type of data can be represented as a three dimensional individual/feature/time tensor and has become increasingly prominent in various areas of science. The tensor biclustering problem computes a subset of individuals and a subset of features whose signal trajectories over time lie in a low-dimensional subspace, modeling similarity among the signal trajectories while allowing different scalings across different individuals or different features. We study the information-theoretic limit of this problem under a generative model. Moreover, we propose an efficient spectral algorithm to solve the tensor biclustering problem and analyze its achievability bound in an asymptotic regime. Finally, we show the efficiency of our proposed method in several synthetic and real datasets.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Purdue University", "Stanford University", "Purdue University", "Shenzhen Polytechnic", "Caritas Institute of Higher Education", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "University of Minnesota", "Arkansas State University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Arkansas State University", "Beijing University of Technology", "University of Reading", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "University of Southampton", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "Sch. of Comput. ...
