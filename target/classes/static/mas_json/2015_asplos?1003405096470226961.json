Scoped synchronization works well for static sharing patterns, where consumer threads are known a priori. It works poorly for dynamic sharing patterns (e.g., work stealing) where programmers cannot use a faster small scope due to the rare possibility that the work is stolen by a thread in a distant slower scope. This puts programmers in a conundrum: optimize the common case by synchronizing at a faster small scope or use work stealing at a slower large scope. In this paper, we propose to extend scoped synchronization with remote-scope promotion. This allows the most frequent sharers to synchronize through a small scope. Infrequent sharers synchronize by promoting that remote small scope to a larger shared scope. Synchronization using remote-scope promotion provides performance robustness for dynamic workloads, where the benefits provided by scoped synchronization and work stealing are hard to anticipate. Compared to a naive baseline, static scoped synchronization alone achieves a 1.07x speedup on average and dynamic work stealing alone achieves a 1.18x speedup on average. In contrast, synchronization using remote-scope promotion achieves a robust 1.25x speedup on average, across a diverse set of graph benchmarks and inputs.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Marc S.
