To help address this situation, we introduce a simple cost function on hierarchies over a set of points, given pairwise similarities between those points. We show that this criterion behaves sensibly in canonical instances and that it admits a top-down construction procedure with a provably good approximation ratio.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Sanjoy Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Sanjoy"], "pages": 10}
