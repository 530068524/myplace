{"title": "Visual masking parameters for virtual environments.", "fields": ["priming", "visual masking", "stereoscopy", "fluency", "image texture"], "abstract": "Visual masking is a technique whereby the rapid presentation of an image can render another image unavailable to conscious perception. Many of its parameters have been studied but the stimuli have traditionally tended to be two dimensional in form, including those used in masked priming experiments. Recently, however, studies have begun to look at visual masking within stereoscopic, virtual environments (VEs). This paper outlines two experiments that alter various properties of visually masked, virtual objects. The first experiment found a significant interaction between surface-colour saturation and texture fluency. The second found an exposure effect modulating affective, visually masked stimuli. Using visually masked, affect-laden stimuli within a VE holds out the promise of creating a potent way to alter affective processes and behaviour. The potential of such effects is widespread, including use within psychotherapeutic interventions, training scenarios and video games.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Jason Drummond.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drummond:Jason", "Anthony Steed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steed:Anthony"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
