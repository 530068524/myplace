The objective is to design a joint coding and rate allocation algorithm which achieves maximum overall receiving quality of the heterogeneous users, measured by broadcasting utility. We use hierarchy optimization to solve this problem, and decompose the problem into a two-tier solution: the inner loop aims at single content broadcasting, solved with a joint coding algorithm; while the outer loop focus on multiple contents broadcasting, using dynamic programming approach to find the optimal rate allocation policy. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Wen Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Wen", "Zhu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
