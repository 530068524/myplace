We perform a systematic comparison of alternative compositional architectures and propose a framework for error detection based on bidirectional LSTMs. Experiments on the CoNLL-14 shared task dataset show the model is able to outperform other participants on detecting errors in learner writing. Finally, the model is integrated with a publicly deployed self-assessment system, leading to performance comparable to human annotators.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Marek Rei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rei:Marek", "Helen Yannakoudakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yannakoudakis:Helen"], "pages": -1}
