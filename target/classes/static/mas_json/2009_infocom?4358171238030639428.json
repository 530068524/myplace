To fully exploit the performance gain brought by network coding, coding-aware routing has been studied to proactively change route of flows for creating more coding opportunities. However, in today's multi-rate wireless networks, coding may not be a wise decision as the lowest rate has to be used for coded information broadcasting, which causes significant resource waste for the high-rate links. In this paper, we propose the idea of cooperative network coding (CNC) to exploit spatial diversity for improving coding opportunity. We provide a theoretical formulation for calculating the maximal throughput of unicast traffic that can be achieved with CNC in multi-rate wireless networks. CNC-aware routing under both Alice-Bob and X-structure are discussed in this paper. The performance evaluation demonstrates that a CNC-aware route selection scheme that leverages cooperative communication to improve coding opportunity leads to higher end-to-end throughput comparing with the coding-oblivious and traditional coding-aware schemes.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Jin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Jin", "Qian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Qian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
