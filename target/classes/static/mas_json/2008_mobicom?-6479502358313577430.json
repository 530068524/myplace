We explore the opportunity to use sophisticated PHY-layer measurements in wireless networking systems for location distinction. We first compare two existing location distinction methods - one based on channel gains of multi-tonal probes, and another on channel impulse response. Next, we combine the benefits of these two methods to develop a new link measurement that we call the complex temporal signature. We use a 2.4 GHz link measurement data set, obtained from CRAWDAD [10], to evaluate the three location distinction methods. We find that the complex temporal signature method performs significantly better compared to the existing methods. We also perform new measurements to understand and model the temporal behavior of link signatures over time. We integrate our model in our location distinction mechanism and significantly reduce the probability of false alarms due to temporal variations of link signatures.", "citation": "Citations (116)", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "authors": ["Junxing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Junxing", "Mohammad Hamed Firooz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Firooz:Mohammad_Hamed", "Neal Patwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patwari:Neal", "Sneha Kumar Kasera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasera:Sneha_Kumar"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
