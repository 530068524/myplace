CrossCheck is the first step towards the passive monitoring of mental health indicators in patients with schizophrenia and paves the way towards relapse prediction and early intervention. In this paper, we present initial results from an ongoing randomized control trial, where passive smartphone sensor data is collected from 21 outpatients with schizophrenia recently discharged from hospital over a period ranging from 2-8.5 months. Our results indicate that there are statistically significant associations between automatically tracked behavioral features related to sleep, mobility, conversations, smart-phone usage and self-reported indicators of mental health in schizophrenia. Using these features we build inference models capable of accurately predicting aggregated scores of mental health indicators in schizophrenia with a mean error of 7.6% of the score range. Finally, we discuss results on the level of personalization that is needed to account for the known variations within people. We show that by leveraging knowledge from a population with schizophrenia, it is possible to train accurate personalized models that require fewer individual-specific data to quickly adapt to new users.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Dartmouth College", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College"], "authors": ["Rui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0016:Rui", "Min S.
