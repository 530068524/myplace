{"title": "There's No Such Thing as the Perfect Map: Quantifying Bias in Spatial Crowd-sourcing Datasets.", "fields": ["global map", "volunteered geographic information", "mathematical theory", "perfect map", "wonder"], "abstract": "Crowd-sourcing has become a popular form of computer mediated collaborative work and OpenStreetMap represents one of the most successful crowd-sourcing systems, where the goal of building and maintaining an accurate global map of the world is being accomplished by means of contributions made by over 1.2M citizens. However, within this apparently large crowd, a tiny group of highly active users is responsible for the mapping of almost all the content. One may thus wonder to what extent the information being mapped is biased towards the interests and agenda of this group of users. In this paper, we present a method to quantitatively measure content bias in crowd-sourced geographic information. We then apply the method to quantify content bias across a three-year period of OpenStreetMap mapping in 40 countries. We find almost no content bias in terms of what is being mapped, but significant geographic bias; furthermore, we find that bias in terms of meticulousness varies with culture.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University of Messina"], "authors": ["Giovanni Quattrone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quattrone:Giovanni", "Licia Capra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capra:Licia", "Pasquale De Meo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meo:Pasquale_De"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
