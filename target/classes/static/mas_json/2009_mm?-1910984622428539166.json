The markers have predefined meanings that guide the system as it creates models. Pantheia takes as input user captured images or video of the marked up space. This video illustrates the workings of the system and shows it being used to create three models, one of a cabinet, one of a lab, and one of a conference room. As part of the Pantheia system, we also developed a 3D viewer that spatially integrates a model with images of the model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["FXPAL, Palo Alto, CA, USA", "FXPAL, Palo Alto, CA, USA", "FXPAL, Palo Alto, CA, USA", "FXPAL, Palo Alto, CA, USA", "FXPAL, Palo Alto, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Eleanor G.
