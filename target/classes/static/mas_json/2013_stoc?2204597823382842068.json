We show how to solve the max flow problem in O(nm + m 31/16  log 2  n) time. In the case that m = O(n 1.06 ), this improves upon the best previous algorithm due to King, Rao, and Tarjan, who solved the max flow problem in O(nm log m/(n log n) n) time. This establishes that the max flow problem is solvable in O(nm) time for all values of n and m. In the case that m = O(n), we improve the running time to O(n 2 / log n).", "citation": "Citations (236)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["James B.
