Local reasoning allows to handle SMT problems involving a certain class of universally quantified formulas in a complete way by instantiation to a finite set of ground formulas. We present a method to generate these instances incrementally, in order to provide a more efficient way of solving these satisfiability problems. The incremental instantiation is guided semantically, inspired by the instance generation approach to first-order theorem proving. Our method is sound and complete, and terminates on both satisfiable and unsatisfiable input after generating a subset of the instances needed in standard local reasoning. Experimental results show that for a large class of examples the incremental approach is substantially more efficient than eager generation of all instances.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Swen Jacobs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobs:Swen"], "pages": 15}
