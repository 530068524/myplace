{"title": "Simulations of below-ground dynamics of fungi: 1.184 pflops attained by automated generation and autotuning of temporal blocking codes.", "fields": ["scaling", "stencil", "domain specific language", "mathematical notation", "stencil code"], "abstract": "Stencil computation has many applications in science and engineering, thus many optimization techniques such as temporal blocking have been developed. They are, however, rarely used in real-world applications, since a large amount of careful programming is required for even the simplest of stencils.   We introduce Formura, a domain specific language that provides easy access to optimized stencil computations. Higher-order integration schemes can be defined using mathematical notations. Formura generates C code with MPI calls and performs autotuning. Hence its performance is portable to most distributed-memory computers.   We show the scientific applicability of Formura by performing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and below-ground biology simulations. Ability to reach bytes-per-flops ratio only attainable by temporal blocking is demonstrated. We also demonstrate scaling up to the full nodes of the K computer, with 1.184 Pflops, 11.62% floating-point-operation efficiency, and 31.26% memory throughput efficiency.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chiba University", "Kobe University", "RIKEN Advanced  ... e, Hyogo, Japan", "RIKEN Advanced  ... ational Science", "RIKEN Advanced  ... ational Science"], "authors": ["Takayuki Muranushi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muranushi:Takayuki", "Hideyuki Hotta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hotta:Hideyuki", "Junichiro Makino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makino:Junichiro", "Seiya Nishizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishizawa:Seiya", "Hirofumi Tomita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomita:Hirofumi", "Keigo Nitadori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nitadori:Keigo", "Masaki Iwasawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwasawa:Masaki", "Natsuki Hosono.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosono:Natsuki", "Yutaka Maruyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maruyama:Yutaka", "Hikaru Inoue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inoue:Hikaru", "Hisashi Yashiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yashiro:Hisashi", "Yoshifumi Nakamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakamura:Yoshifumi"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2016", "pages": 11}
