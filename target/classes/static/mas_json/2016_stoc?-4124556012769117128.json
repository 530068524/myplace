It follows from this protocol that approximating the non-local value of a multi-player one-round game to inverse polynomial precision is QMA-hard. Our work makes an interesting connection between the theory of QMA-completeness and Hamiltonian complexity on one hand and the study of non-local games and Bell inequalities on the other.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Zhengfeng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Zhengfeng"], "pages": 14}
