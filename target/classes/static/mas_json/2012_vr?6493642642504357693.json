Cup-le has various sensors to record participants' nonverbal behavior such as utterance. Cup-le saves the work of attaching sensors. Also, since Cup-le appears cup-shaped, it can sense without being aware of the sensor unlike conventional wearable sensors. Moreover, by attaching touch display, Cup-le can show information and can be operated. In this conversational experiment, we use the input-output as method to have a questionnaire during the experiment and capture participants' impression for their conversation. We conducted real conversational experiment with Cup-le, and we confirmed that Cup-le supported sufficiently the experiment without affecting their impression.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Tohoku University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Yusuke Hayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayashi:Yusuke", "Yuichi Itoh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Itoh:Yuichi", "Kazuki Takashima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takashima:Kazuki", "Kazuyuki Fujita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujita:Kazuyuki", "Kosuke Nakajima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakajima:Kosuke", "Ikuo Daibo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daibo:Ikuo", "Takao Onoye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onoye:Takao"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
