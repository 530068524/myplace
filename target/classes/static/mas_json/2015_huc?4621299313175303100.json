We present MagnifiSense, a low-power wearable system that uses three passive magneto-inductive sensors and a minimal ADC setup to identify the device a person is operating. MagnifiSense achieves this by analyzing near-field electromagnetic radiation from common components such as the motors, rectifiers, and modulators. We conducted a staged, in-the-wild evaluation where an instrumented participant used a set of devices in a variety of settings in the home such as cooking and outdoors such as commuting in a vehicle. MagnifiSense achieves a classification accuracy of 82.6% using a model-agnostic classifier and 94.0% using a model-specific classifier. In a 24-hour naturalistic deployment, MagnifiSense correctly identified 25 of the total 29 events, while achieving a low false positive rate of 0.65% during 20.5 hours of non-activity.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Edward Jay Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Edward_Jay", "TienJui Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:TienJui", "Alexander Mariakakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mariakakis:Alexander", "Mayank Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Mayank", "Sidhant Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Sidhant", "Shwetak N.
