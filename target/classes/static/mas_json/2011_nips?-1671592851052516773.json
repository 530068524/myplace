{"title": "From Stochastic Nonlinear Integrate-and-Fire to Generalized Linear Models.", "fields": ["nonlinear system", "numerical analysis", "expression", "generalized linear model", "exponential function"], "abstract": "Variability in single neuron models is typically implemented either by a stochastic Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire model or by a model of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) family. We use analytical and numerical methods to relate state-of-the-art models from both schools of thought. First we find the analytical expressions relating the subthreshold voltage from the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire model (AdEx) to the Spike-Response Model with escape noise (SRM as an example of a GLM). Then we calculate numerically the link-function that provides the firing probability given a deterministic membrane potential. We find a mathematical expression for this link-function and test the ability of the GLM to predict the firing probability of a neuron receiving complex stimulation. Comparing the prediction performance of various link-functions, we find that a GLM with an exponential link-function provides an excellent approximation to the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire with colored-noise input. These results help to understand the relationship between the different approaches to stochastic neuron models.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Skander Mensi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mensi:Skander", "Richard Naud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naud:Richard", "Wulfram Gerstner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerstner:Wulfram"], "pages": 9}
