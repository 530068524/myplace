To leverage the kernel-based methods developed for Euclidean space, several recent methods have been proposed to embed the Grassmann manifold into a high dimensional Hilbert space by exploiting the well established Project Metric, which can approximate the Riemannian geometry of Grassmann manifold. Nevertheless, they inevitably introduce the drawbacks from traditional kernel-based methods such as implicit map and high computational cost to the Grassmann manifold. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel method to learn the Projection Metric directly on Grassmann manifold rather than in Hilbert space. From the perspective of manifold learning, our method can be regarded as performing a geometry-aware dimensionality reduction from the original Grassmann manifold to a lower-dimensional, more discriminative Grassmann manifold where more favorable classification can be achieved. Experiments on several real-world video face datasets demonstrate that the proposed method yields competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhiwu Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zhiwu", "Ruiping Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Ruiping", "Shiguang Shan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shan:Shiguang", "Xilin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xilin"], "pages": 10}
