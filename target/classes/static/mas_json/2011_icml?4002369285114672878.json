We show that either randomized or history-based policies can improve performance. We prove that the complexity of computing a policy that maximizes the mean reward under a variance constraint is NP-hard for some cases, and strongly NP-hard for others. We finally offer pseudopoly-nomial exact and approximation algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie", "John N.
