{"title": "Providing Haptics to Walls & Heavy Objects in Virtual Reality by Means of Electrical Muscle Stimulation.", "fields": ["haptic technology", "wearable computer", "virtual reality", "multimedia", "electrical muscle stimulation"], "abstract": "We explore how to add haptics to walls and other heavy objects in virtual reality. When a user tries to push such an object, our system actuates the user's shoulder, arm, and wrist muscles by means of electrical muscle stimulation, creating a counter force that pulls the user's arm backwards. Our device accomplishes this in a wearable form factor.   In our first user study, participants wearing a head-mounted display interacted with objects provided with different types of EMS effects. The  repulsion  design (visualized as an electrical field) and the  soft  design (visualized as a magnetic field) received high scores on \"prevented me from passing through\" as well as \"realistic\".   In a second study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by letting participants explore a virtual world in which all objects provide haptic EMS effects, including walls, gates, sliders, boxes, and projectiles.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Pedro Lopes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lopes_0001:Pedro", "Sijing You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Sijing", "Lung-Pan Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Lung=Pan", "Sebastian Marwecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marwecki:Sebastian", "Patrick Baudisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baudisch:Patrick"], "pages": 12}
