This framework is parametric w.r.t. the adopted description logic and the progression mechanism. In this setting, we discuss verification and adversarial synthesis for specifications expressed in a variant of first-order \u00b5-calculus, with a controlled form of quantification across successive states and present key decidability results under the natural assumption of state-boundedness.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "authors": ["Diego Calvanese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calvanese:Diego", "Marco Montali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montali:Marco", "Fabio Patrizi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patrizi:Fabio", "Giuseppe De Giacomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giacomo:Giuseppe_De"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
