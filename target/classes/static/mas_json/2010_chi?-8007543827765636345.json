Participants can apply tags to different points of the interaction as it is ongoing and can see, in near real-time, the \"flow\" of tags as they are being contributed. Two novel types of tags are proposed: \"deep tags\" that apply to a portion of the interaction and \"instant tags\" that apply to an instant of the interaction. Our system is being used by enterprise users and we analyze a corpus of 737 live-tags collected from 16 conversations that took place over several months. We found that the live-tags for audio have slightly different characteristics from Web 2.0 tags: they are longer and confer affordances on the audio like description and summarization. Some observations on the \"cognitive cost\" of live-tagging are offered.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Avaya", "Avaya", "Avaya"], "authors": ["Shreeharsh Kelkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelkar:Shreeharsh", "Ajita John.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/John:Ajita", "Dor\u00e9e Duncan Seligmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seligmann:Dor=eacute=e_Duncan"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
