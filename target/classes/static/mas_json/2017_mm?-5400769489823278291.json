{"title": "Modeling the Intransitive Pairwise Image Preference from Multiple Angles.", "fields": ["data set", "transitive relation", "intransitivity", "pairwise comparison", "ranking"], "abstract": "Among the previous studies in modeling users' preference on images, most of them assume there is a consistent ranking of images, and users' preference is transitive. That is, if a user likes image A over B and B over C, it must have A over C for this user. This condition holds when user compares images from a single angle. However, if there are multiple angles to consider, users' preference may not be transitive at all. Thus, it is interesting to know whether users' pairwise preference on images can be intransitive, and how can such personalized intransitivity be modeled.   In this paper, the problem of modeling the intransitive pairwise image preference is studied, and a family of multi-angle preference models based on pairwise image comparisons are proposed to tackle this problem. These models separately consider users' most-like angles, least-like angles and the balance between two sides towards different images. This study attempts to find the angles that each user selects to evaluate images as well as the angles that each image attracts general users. The experimental results on two real-world data sets show superior performance of the proposed models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jun", "Chaokun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chaokun", "Jianmin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Jianmin"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
