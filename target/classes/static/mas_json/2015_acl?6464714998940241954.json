Node generation, typically done using a simple dictionary lookup, is currently an important limiting factor in AMR parsing. We propose a small set of actions that derive AMR subgraphs by transformations on spans of text, which allows for more robust learning of this stage. Our set of construction actions generalize better than the previous approach, and can be learned with a simple classifier. We improve on the previous state-of-the-art result for AMR parsing, boosting end-to-end performance by 3 F$_1$ on both the LDC2013E117 and LDC2014T12 datasets.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Keenon Werling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Werling:Keenon", "Gabor Angeli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angeli:Gabor", "Christopher D.
