We present an algorithm for continuous, online stereo extrinsic re-calibration operating only on sparse stereo correspondences on a per-frame basis. We obtain the 5 degree of freedom extrinsic pose for each frame, with a fixed baseline, making it possible to model time-dependent variations. The initial extrinsic estimates are found by minimizing epipolar errors, and are refined via a Kalman Filter (KF). Observation covariances are derived from the Cra\u00b4mer-Rao lower bound of the solution uncertainty. The algorithm operates at frame rate with unoptimized Matlab code with over 1000 correspondences per frame. We validate its performance using a variety of real stereo datasets and simulations.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Peter Hansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hansen_0001:Peter", "Hatem Alismail.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alismail:Hatem", "Peter Rander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rander:Peter", "Brett Browning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Browning:Brett"], "pages": 8}
