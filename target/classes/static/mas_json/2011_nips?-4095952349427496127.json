We describe a closed-form Bayesian approach to learning these models, and describe an importance sampling algorithm for forecasting future events using these models, using a proposal distribution based on Poisson superposition. We then use synthetic data, supercomputer event logs, and web search query logs to illustrate that our learning algorithm can efficiently learn nonlinear temporal dependencies, and that our importance sampling algorithm can effectively forecast future events.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Johns Hopkins University"], "authors": ["Asela Gunawardana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gunawardana:Asela", "Christopher Meek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meek:Christopher", "Puyang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Puyang"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
