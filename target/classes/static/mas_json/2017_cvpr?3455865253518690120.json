{"title": "Beyond Triplet Loss: A Deep Quadruplet Network for Person Re-identification.", "fields": ["deep learning", "training set", "feature extraction", "pattern recognition", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Person re-identification (ReID) is an important task in wide area video surveillance which focuses on identifying people across different cameras. Recently, deep learning networks with a triplet loss become a common framework for person ReID. However, the triplet loss pays main attentions on obtaining correct orders on the training set. It still suffers from a weaker generalization capability from the training set to the testing set, thus resulting in inferior performance. In this paper, we design a quadruplet loss, which can lead to the model output with a larger inter-class variation and a smaller intra-class variation compared to the triplet loss. As a result, our model has a better generalization ability and can achieve a higher performance on the testing set. In particular, a quadruplet deep network using a margin-based online hard negative mining is proposed based on the quadruplet loss for the person ReID. In extensive experiments, the proposed network outperforms most of the state-of-the-art algorithms on representative datasets which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (110)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Dundee", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Weihua Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Weihua", "Xiaotang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiaotang", "Jianguo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jianguo", "Kaiqi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Kaiqi"], "pages": 10}
