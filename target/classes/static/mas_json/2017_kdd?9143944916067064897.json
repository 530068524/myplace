In this paper, we propose a new model which learns compact topic embeddings and captures topic correlations through the closeness between the topic vectors. Our method enables efficient inference in the low-dimensional embedding space, reducing previous cubic or quadratic time complexity to  linear  w.r.t the topic size. We further speedup variational inference with a fast sampler to exploit sparsity of topic occurrence. Extensive experiments show that our approach is capable of handling model and data scales which are several orders of magnitude larger than existing correlation results, without sacrificing modeling quality by providing competitive or superior performance in document classification and retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Junxian He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Junxian", "Zhiting Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Zhiting", "Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berg=Kirkpatrick:Taylor", "Ying Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Ying", "Eric P.
