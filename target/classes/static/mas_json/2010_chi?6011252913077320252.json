Over the course of 13 weeks, eight women, each a member of a livelihoods collective in urban Cape Town, South Africa, received training to make use of the data (internet) features on the phones they already owned. None of the women had previous exposure to PCs or the internet. Activities focused on social networking, entertainment, information search, and, in particular, job searches. Results of the exercise reveal both the promise of, and barriers to, mobile internet use by a potentially large community of first-time, mobile-centric users. Discussion focuses on the importance of self-expression and identity management in the refinement of online and offline presences, and considers these forces relative to issues of gender and socioeconomic status.", "citation": "Citations (121)", "departments": ["University of Cape Town", "University of Cape Town", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Shikoh Gitau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gitau:Shikoh", "Gary Marsden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marsden:Gary", "Jonathan Donner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Donner:Jonathan"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
