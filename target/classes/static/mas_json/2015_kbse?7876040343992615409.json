{"title": "ActivitySpace: A Remembrance Framework to Support Interapplication Information Needs.", "fields": ["information needs", "fragmentation", "information management", "semantics", "software"], "abstract": "Developers' daily work produces, transforms, and communicates cross-cutting information across applications, including IDEs, emails, Q&A sites, Twitter, and many others. However, these applications function independently of one another. Even though each application has their own effective information management mechanisms, cross-cutting information across separate applications creates a problem of information fragmentation, forcing developers to manually track, correlate, and re-find cross-cutting information across applications. In this paper, we present ActivitySpace, a remembrance framework that unobtrusively tracks and analyze a developer's daily work in separate applications, and provides various semantic and episodic UIs that help developers correlate and re-find cross-cutting information across applications based on information content, time and place of his/her activities. Through a user study of 8 participants, we demonstrate how ActivitySpace helps to tackle information fragmentation problem in developers' daily work.
