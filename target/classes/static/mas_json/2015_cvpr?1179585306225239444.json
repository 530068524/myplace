In this paper, we propose dataset fingerprints, a new and powerful method based on data mining that extracts meaningful patterns from a set of images. The discovered patterns are compositions of discriminative midlevel features that co-occur in several images. Compared to earlier work, ours stands out because i) it's fully unsupervised, ii) discovered patterns cover large parts of the images, often corresponding to full objects or meaningful parts thereof, and iii) different patterns are connected based on co-occurrence, allowing a user to \u201cbrowse\u201d the images from one pattern to the next and to group patterns in a semantically meaningful manner.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Konstantinos Rematas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rematas:Konstantinos", "Basura Fernando.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fernando:Basura", "Frank Dellaert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dellaert:Frank", "Tinne Tuytelaars.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tuytelaars:Tinne"], "pages": 9}
