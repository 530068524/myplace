Recently, it has been shown that the MaxWeight algorithm, which is throughput-optimal in networks with a fixed number of users, fails to achieve the maximum throughput in the presence of flow-level dynamics. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called Workload-based Scheduling with Learning, which is provably throughput-optimal, requires no prior knowledge of channels and user demands, and performs significantly better than previously suggested algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Shihuan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shihuan", "Lei Ying.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ying:Lei", "R.
