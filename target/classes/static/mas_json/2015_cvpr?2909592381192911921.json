To address this issue with minimal human interventions, we propose (i) a sample selection criterion used for active query of informative samples by minimizing the expected prediction error, and (ii) an efficient correction propagation method that propagates human correction on selected samples over a gradually-augmented graph to unlabeled samples without rebuilding the affinity graph. Experimental results conducted on three real world datasets validate that our active sample selection and correction propagation algorithm quickly reaches high quality classification results with minimal human interventions.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Missouri University of Science and Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hang Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Hang", "Zhaozheng Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Zhaozheng", "Takeo Kanade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanade:Takeo", "Seungil Huh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huh:Seungil"], "pages": 9}
