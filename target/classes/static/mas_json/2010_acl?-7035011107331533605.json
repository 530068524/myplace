{"title": "Beyond NomBank: A Study of Implicit Arguments for Nominal Predicates.", "fields": ["machine learning", "semantic memory", "selection", "predicate", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Despite its substantial coverage, NomBank does not account for all within-sentence arguments and ignores extra-sentential arguments altogether. These arguments, which we call implicit, are important to semantic processing, and their recovery could potentially benefit many NLP applications. We present a study of implicit arguments for a select group of frequent nominal predicates. We show that implicit arguments are pervasive for these predicates, adding 65% to the coverage of NomBank. We demonstrate the feasibility of recovering implicit arguments with a supervised classification model. Our results and analyses provide a baseline for future work on this emerging task.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Matthew Gerber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerber:Matthew", "Joyce Yue Chai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chai:Joyce_Yue"], "pages": 10}
