The present article introduces a dynamic oracle for transition-based constituent parsing. Experiments on the 9 languages of the SPMRL dataset show that a neural greedy parser with morphological features , trained with a dynamic oracle, leads to accuracies comparable with the best non-reranking and non-ensemble parsers.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Paris Diderot University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Maximin Coavoux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coavoux:Maximin", "Beno\u00eet Crabb\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crabb=eacute=:Beno=icirc=t"], "pages": -1}
