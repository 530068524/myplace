We also propose different learning algorithms for finding linear classifiers that minimize these bounds. These learning algorithms are generally competitive with both AdaBoost and the SVM.", "citation": "Citations (126)", "departments": ["Laval University", "Laval University", "Laval University", "Laval University"], "authors": ["Pascal Germain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Germain:Pascal", "Alexandre Lacasse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lacasse:Alexandre", "Fran\u00e7ois Laviolette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laviolette:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Mario Marchand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marchand:Mario"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
