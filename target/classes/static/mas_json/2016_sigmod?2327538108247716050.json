In fact, the use of such devices is widely acknowledged to be the only promising way to achieve application-speedups that users urgently need and expect. However, building a robust and efficient query engine for heterogeneous co-processor environments is still a significant challenge.   In this paper, we identify two effects that limit performance in case co-processor resources become scarce. Cache thrashing occurs when the working set of queries does not fit into the co-processor's data cache, resulting in performance degradations up to a factor of 24. Heap contention occurs when multiple operators run in parallel on a co-processor and when their accumulated memory footprint exceeds the main memory capacity of the co-processor, slowing down query execution by up to a factor of six.   We propose solutions for both effects. Data-driven operator placement avoids data movements when they might be harmful; query chopping limits co-processor memory usage and thus avoids contention. The combined approach-data-driven query chopping-achieves robust and scalable performance on co-processors. We validate our proposal with our open-source GPU-accelerated database engine CoGaDB and the popular star schema and TPC-H benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "Technical University of Dortmund", "Technical University of Dortmund"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sebastian Bre\u00df.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bre=szlig=:Sebastian", "Henning Funke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Funke:Henning", "Jens Teubner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teubner:Jens"], "pages": 16}
