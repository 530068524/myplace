We propose a tree-based reassembly that greedily merges components while respecting the geometric constraints of the puzzle problem. The algorithm has state-of-the-art performance for puzzle assembly, whether or not the orientation of the pieces is known. Our algorithm makes fewer assumptions than past work, and success is shown even when pieces from multiple puzzles are mixed together. For solving puzzles where jigsaw piece location is known but orientation is unknown, we propose a pairwise MRF where each node represents a jigsaw piece's orientation. Other contributions of the paper include an improved measure (MGC) for quantifying the compatibility of potential jigsaw piece matches based on expecting smoothness in gradient distributions across boundaries.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Eastman Kodak Company"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Andrew C.
