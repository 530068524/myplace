Inspired by the observation that only a few facial parts are active in expression disclosure (e.g., around mouth, eye), we try to discover the common and specific patches which are important to discriminate all the expressions and only a particular expression, respectively. A two-stage multi-task sparse learning (MTSL) framework is proposed to efficiently locate those discriminative patches. In the first stage MTSL, expression recognition tasks, each of which aims to find dominant patches for each expression, are combined to located common patches. Second, two related tasks, facial expression recognition and face verification tasks, are coupled to learn specific facial patches for individual expression. Extensive experiments validate the existence and significance of common and specific patches. Utilizing these learned patches, we achieve superior performances on expression recognition compared to the state-of-the-arts.", "citation": "Citations (194)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Lin Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong_0002:Lin", "Qingshan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Qingshan", "Peng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Peng", "Bo Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Bo", "Junzhou Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Junzhou", "Dimitris N.
