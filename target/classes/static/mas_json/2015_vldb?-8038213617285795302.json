While in-memory database systems can read the database without I/O, database updates can generate a substantial amount of I/O, since updates must normally be written to persistent secondary storage to ensure that they are durable. In this paper we present a study of storage managers for in-memory database systems, with the goal of characterizing their I/O efficiency. We model the storage efficiency of two classes of storage managers: those that perform in-place updates in secondary storage, and those that use copy-on-write. Our models allow us to make meaningful, quantitative comparisons of storage managers' I/O efficiencies under a variety of conditions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Jaemyung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jaemyung", "Kenneth Salem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salem:Kenneth", "Khuzaima Daudjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daudjee:Khuzaima"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
