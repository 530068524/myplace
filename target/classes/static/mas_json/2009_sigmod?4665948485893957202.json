The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of $1.0 \\times 10^{-21}$. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 {\\sigma}. The source lies at a luminosity distance of $410^{+160}_{-180}$ Mpc corresponding to a redshift $z = 0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are $36^{+5}_{-4} M_\\odot$ and $29^{+4}_{-4} M_\\odot$, and the final black hole mass is $62^{+4}_{-4} M_\\odot$, with $3.0^{+0.5}_{-0.5} M_\\odot c^2$ radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90% credible intervals.These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.", "citation": "Citations (3,302)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "Louisiana State University", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "Louisiana State University", "American University", "University of Salerno", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "Louisiana State University", "University of Salerno", "University of Florida", "Columbia University", "CERN", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "Louisiana State University", "California Institute of Technology", "University of Salerno", "INFN, Sezione d ... 3 Milano, Italy", "INFN, Sezione d ... 3 Milano, Italy", "INFN, Sezione d ... 3 Milano, Italy"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Fei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Fei", "Kevin S.
