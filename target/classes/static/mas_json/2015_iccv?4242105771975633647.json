However, most pooling methods are unsupervised and heuristic. In this paper, we propose a novel task-driven pooling (TDP) model to directly learn the pooled representation from data in a discriminative manner. Different from the traditional methods (e.g., average and max pooling), TDP is an implicit pooling method which elegantly integrates the learning of representations into the given classification task. The optimization of TDP can equalize the similarities between the descriptors and the learned representation, and maximize the classification accuracy. TDP can be combined with the traditional BoW models (coding vectors) or the recent state-of-the-art CNN models (feature maps) to achieve a much better pooled representation. Furthermore, a self-training mechanism is used to generate the TDP representation for a new test image. A multi-task extension of TDP is also proposed to further improve the performance. Experiments on three databases (Flower-17, Indoor-67 and Caltech-101) well validate the effectiveness of our models.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Nanjing University of Science and Technology", "National University of Singapore", "NLPR, Inst. of  ...
