In this paper, we present conditional generative moment-matching networks (CGMMN), which learn a conditional distribution given some input variables based on a conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) criterion. The learning is performed by stochastic gradient descent with the gradient calculated by back-propagation. We evaluate CGMMN on a wide range of tasks, including predictive modeling, contextual generation, and Bayesian dark knowledge, which distills knowledge from a Bayesian model by learning a relatively small CGMMN student network. Our results demonstrate competitive performance in all the tasks.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yong Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Yong", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Jialian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jialian", "Yucen Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Yucen"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
