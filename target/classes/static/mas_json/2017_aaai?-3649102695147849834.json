{"title": "Neural Models for Sequence Chunking.", "fields": ["chunking", "sequence labeling", "shallow parsing", "natural language understanding"], "abstract": "Many natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, such as shallow parsing (i.e., text chunking) and semantic slot filling, require the assignment of representative labels to the meaningful chunks in a sentence. Most of the current deep neural network (DNN) based methods consider these tasks as a sequence labeling problem, in which a word, rather than a chunk, is treated as the basic unit for labeling. These chunks are then inferred by the standard IOB (Inside-Outside-Beginning) labels. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach by investigating the use of DNN for sequence chunking, and propose three neural models so that each chunk can be treated as a complete unit for labeling. Experimental results show that the proposed neural sequence chunking models can achieve start-of-the-art performance on both the text chunking and slot filling tasks.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "IBM"], "authors": ["Feifei Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Feifei", "Saloni Potdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Potdar:Saloni", "Bing Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Bing", "Bowen Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Bowen"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
