{"title": "Quartz: a new design element for low-latency DCNs.", "fields": ["latency", "multiplexer", "random graph", "bisection bandwidth", "low latency"], "abstract": "Most datacenter network (DCN) designs focus on maximizing bisection bandwidth rather than minimizing server-to-server latency. We explore architectural approaches to building low-latency DCNs and introduce Quartz, a design element consisting of a full mesh of switches. Quartz can be used to replace portions of either a hierarchical network or a random network. Our analysis shows that replacing high port-count core switches with Quartz can significantly reduce switching delays, and replacing groups of top-of-rack and aggregation switches with Quartz can significantly reduce congestion-related delays from cross-traffic. We overcome the complexity of wiring a complete mesh using low-cost optical multiplexers that enable us to efficiently implement a logical mesh as a physical ring. We evaluate our performance using both simulations and a small working prototype. Our evaluation results confirm our analysis, and demonstrate that it is possible to build low-latency DCNs using inexpensive commodity elements without significant concessions to cost, scalability, or wiring complexity.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Yunpeng James Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunpeng_James", "Peter Xiang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Peter_Xiang", "Bernard Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Bernard", "Srinivasan Keshav.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keshav:Srinivasan"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
