This general network design framework has been studied extensively and is tied to the development of major algorithmic techniques. For the edge-connectivity version of the problem, a 2-approximation algorithm is known for arbitrary pairwise connectivity requirements. However, no non-trivial algorithms are known for its vertex connectivity counterpart. In fact, even highly restricted special cases of the vertex connectivity version remain poorly understood.We study the single-source k-vertex connectivity version of SNDP. We are given a graph G(V,E) with a subset T of terminals and a source vertex s, and the goal is to find a minimum cost subset of edges ensuring that every terminal is k-vertex connected to s. Our main result is an O(k log n)-approximation algorithm for this problem; this improves upon the recent 2 O(k   2   ) log 4  n-approximation. Our algorithm is based on an intuitive rerouting scheme. The analysis relies on a structural result that may be of independent interest: we show that any solution can be decomposed into a disjoint collection of multiple-legged spiders, which are then used to re-route flow from terminals to the source via other terminals.We also obtain the first non-trivial approximation algorithm for the vertex-cost version of the same problem, achieving an O(k 7 log 2  n)-approximation.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Toyota", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Julia Chuzhoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuzhoy:Julia", "Sanjeev Khanna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khanna:Sanjeev"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
