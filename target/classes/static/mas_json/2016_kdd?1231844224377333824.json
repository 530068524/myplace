Among algorithms for solving such problems, Inductive Matrix Completion(IMC) has drawn a considerable amount of attention, not only for its well established theoretical guarantees but also for its superior performance in various real-world applications. However, IMC based methods usually place very strong constraints on the quality of the features(side information) to ensure accurate recovery, which might not be met in practice. In this paper, we propose Goal-directed Inductive Matrix Completion(GIMC) to learn a nonlinear mapping of the features so that they satisfy the required properties. A key distinction between GIMC and IMC is that the feature mapping is learnt in a supervised manner, deviating from the traditional approach of unsupervised feature learning followed by model training. We establish the superiority of our method on several popular machine learning applications including multi-label learning, multi-class classification, and semi-supervised clustering.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, Davis", "Technicolor", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Si Si.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Si:Si", "Kai-Yang Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang:Kai=Yang", "Cho-Jui Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Cho=Jui", "Nikhil Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Nikhil", "Inderjit S.
