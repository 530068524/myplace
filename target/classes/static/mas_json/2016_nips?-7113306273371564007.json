For pool-based active learning, several effective methods with theoretical guarantees have been developed through maximizing some utility function satisfying adaptive submodularity. In contrast, there have been few methods for stream-based active learning based on adaptive submodularity. In this paper, we propose a new class of utility functions, policy-adaptive submodular functions, and prove this class includes many existing adaptive submodular functions appearing in real world problems. We provide a general framework based on policy-adaptive submodularity that makes it possible to convert existing pool-based methods to stream-based methods and give theoretical guarantees on their performance. In addition we empirically demonstrate their effectiveness comparing with existing heuristics on common benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Kyoto University"], "authors": ["Kaito Fujii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujii:Kaito", "Hisashi Kashima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kashima:Hisashi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
