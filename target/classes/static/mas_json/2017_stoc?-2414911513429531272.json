{"title": "Faster space-efficient algorithms for subset sum and k-sum.", "fields": ["bounded function", "binary logarithm", "subset sum problem", "random access", "knapsack problem"], "abstract": "We present randomized algorithms that solve Subset Sum and Knapsack instances with  n  items in  O  * (2 0.86 n  ) time, where the  O  * (\ufffd\u00b7) notation suppresses factors polynomial in the input size, and polynomial space, assuming random read-only access to exponentially many random bits. These results can be extended to solve Binary Linear Programming on  n  variables with few constraints in a similar running time. We also show that for any constant  k \u00e2 \ufffd 2, random instances of  k -Sum can be solved using  O ( n   k \u00e2  0.5 ( n )) time and  O (log n ) space, without the assumption of random access to random bits.   Underlying these results is an algorithm that determines whether two given lists of length  n  with integers bounded by a polynomial in  n  share a common value. Assuming random read-only access to random bits, we show that this problem can be solved using  O (log n ) space significantly faster than the trivial  O ( n  2 ) time algorithm if no value occurs too often in the same list.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Nikhil Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Nikhil", "Shashwat Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Shashwat", "Jesper Nederlof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nederlof:Jesper", "Nikhil Vyas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vyas_0001:Nikhil"], "pages": 12}
