Unfortunately, children can be misled by interrogators or might offer false information, with dire consequences. In this work, we evaluate various parameterizations of five classifiers (including support vector machines, neural networks, and random forests) in deciphering truth from lies given transcripts of interviews with 198 victims of abuse between the ages of 4 and 7. These evaluations are performed using a novel set of syntactic features, including measures of complexity. Our results show that sentence length, the mean number of clauses per utterance, and the StajnerMitkov measure of complexity are highly informative syntactic features, that classification accuracy varies greatly by the age of the speaker, and that accuracy up to 91.7% can be achieved by support vector machines given a sufficient amount of data.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Maria Yancheva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yancheva:Maria", "Frank Rudzicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudzicz:Frank"], "pages": 10}
