The idea is not fundamentally different from ship or air navigation systems, known for centuries. Nonetheless, directly applying the idea to human-scale environments is non-trivial. Noisy phone sensors and complicated human movements present practical research challenges. We cope with these challenges by recording a person's walking patterns, and matching it against possible path signatures generated from a local electronic map. Electronic maps enable greater coverage, while eliminating the reliance on WiFi infrastructure and expensive war-driving. Measurements on Nokia phones and evaluation with real users confirm the anticipated benefits. Results show a location accuracy of less than 11m in regions where today's localization services are unsatisfactory or unavailable.", "citation": "Citations (366)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Ionut Constandache.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Constandache:Ionut", "Romit Roy Choudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhury:Romit_Roy", "Injong Rhee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rhee:Injong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
