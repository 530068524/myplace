{"title": "Structuring ordered nominal data for event sequence discovery.", "fields": ["structuring", "speech processing", "parsing", "streams", "ranking"], "abstract": "This work investigates using n-gram processing and a temporal relation encoding to providing relational information about events extracted from media streams. The event information is temporal and nominal in nature being categorized by a descriptive label or symbolic means and can be difficult to relationally compare and give ranking metrics. Given a parsed sequence of events, relational information pertinent to comparison between events can be obtained through the application of n-grams techniques borrowed from speech processing and temporal relation logic. The procedure is discussed along with results computed using a representative data set characterized by nominal event data.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Chreston A.
