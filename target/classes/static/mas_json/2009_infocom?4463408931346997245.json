Existing models of BT abstract away certain characteristics of the protocol that are important, which we address in this work. We present a simple yet accurate and easily extensible model of BT. The model's accuracy is validated through a rigorous simulation-based study and its extensibility is illustrated by incorporating recently proposed approaches to protocol changes in BT.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Alix L.
