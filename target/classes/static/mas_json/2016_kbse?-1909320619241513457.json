In this paper, we propose an automated approach to finding and ranking potential classes with the respect to the probability of containing a bug based on a bug report description. Our approach finds a good balance between minimizing the number of recommended classes and maximizing the relevance of the proposed solution using a multi-objective optimization algorithm. The relevance of the recommended classes (solution) is estimated based on the use of the history of changes and bug-fixing, and the lexical similarity between the bug report description and the API documentation. We evaluated our system on 6 open source Java projects, using the version of the project before fixing the bug of many bug reports. The experimental results show that the search-based approach significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art methods in recommending relevant files for bug reports. In particular, our multi-objective approach is able to successfully locate the true buggy methods within the top 10 recommendations for over 87% of the bug reports.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Rafi Almhana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Almhana:Rafi", "Wiem Mkaouer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mkaouer:Wiem", "Marouane Kessentini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kessentini:Marouane", "Ali Ouni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouni_0001:Ali"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
