Unlike coarser discriminative models that work well when action classes are nicely separated, we seek models that have fine-scale representational power and can therefore model subtle differences in the way an action is performed. To this end, we model an observed action as an (unknown) linear time-invariant dynamical model of relatively small order, driven by a sparse bounded input signal. Our motivating intuition is that the time-invariant dynamics will capture the unchanging physical characteristics of an actor, while the inputs used to excite the system will correspond to a causal signature of the action being performed. We show that our model has sufficient representational power to closely approximate large classes of non-stationary actions with significantly reduced complexity. We also show that temporal statistics of the inferred input sequences can be compared in order to recognize actions and detect transitions between them.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michalis Raptis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raptis:Michalis", "Kamil Wnuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wnuk:Kamil", "Stefano Soatto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soatto:Stefano"], "pages": 8}
