{"title": "Looking ahead: query preview in exploratory search.", "fields": ["information seeking behavior", "ranking", "query expansion", "web search query", "exploratory search"], "abstract": "Exploratory search is a complex, iterative information seeking activity that involves running multiple queries and finding and examining many documents. We designed a query preview control that visualizes the distribution of newly-retrieved and re-retrieved documents prior to running the query. When evaluating the preview control with a control condition, we found effects on both people's information seeking behavior and improved retrieval performance. People spent more time formulating a query and were more likely to explore search results more deeply, retrieved a more diverse set of documents, and found more different relevant documents when using the preview.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Pernilla Qvarfordt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qvarfordt:Pernilla", "Gene Golovchinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golovchinsky:Gene", "Tony Dunnigan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunnigan:Tony", "Elena Agapie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agapie:Elena"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
