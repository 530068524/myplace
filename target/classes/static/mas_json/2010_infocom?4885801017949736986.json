We first model a bus with forbidden transition constraints as a forbidden transition channel, and derive the Shannon capacity of such a channel. Then we perform a worst case analysis and a probabilistic analysis for the bit-stuffing algorithm. We show by both theoretic analysis and simulations that the coding rate of the bit stuffing encoding scheme for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli input traffic is quite close to the Shannon capacity, and hence is much better than those of the existing forbidden transition codes in the literature, including the Fibonacci representation.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University"], "authors": ["Cheng-Shang Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Cheng=Shang", "Jay Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Jay", "Tien-Ke Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Tien=Ke", "Xuan-Chao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xuan=Chao", "Duan-Shin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Duan=Shin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
