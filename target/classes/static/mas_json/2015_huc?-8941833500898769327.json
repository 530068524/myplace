We conduct a user study to identify such unused apps, which we call zombies, and show via experiments that zombie apps consume significant resources on a user's smartphone and access her private information. We then design and build  ZapDroid , which enables users to detect and silo zombie apps in an effective way to prevent their undesired activities. If and when the user wishes to resume using such an app,  ZapDroid  restores the app quickly and effectively. Our evaluations show that: (i)  ZapDroid  saves twice the energy from unwanted zombie app behaviors as compared to apps from the Play Store that kill background unwanted processes, and (ii) it effectively prevents zombie apps from using undesired permissions. In addition,  ZapDroid  is energ-efficient, consuming", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of Michigan", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of Michigan", "New Jersey Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Indrajeet Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Indrajeet", "Srikanth V.
