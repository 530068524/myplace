{"title": "ERIS live: a NUMA-aware in-memory storage engine for tera-scale multiprocessor systems.", "fields": ["latency", "hardware performance counter", "cache only memory architecture", "eris", "exploit"], "abstract": "The ever-growing demand for more computing power forces hardware vendors to put an increasing number of multiprocessors into a single server system, which usually exhibits a non-uniform memory access (NUMA). In-memory database systems running on NUMA platforms face several issues such as the increased latency and the decreased bandwidth when accessing remote main memory. To cope with these NUMA-related issues, a DBMS has to allow flexible data partitioning and data placement at runtime.   In this demonstration, we present ERIS, our NUMA-aware in-memory storage engine. ERIS uses an adaptive partitioning approach that exploits the topology of the underlying NUMA platform and significantly reduces NUMA-related issues. We demonstrate throughput numbers and hardware performance counter evaluations of ERIS and a NUMA-unaware index for different workloads and configurations. All experiments are conducted on a standard server system as well as on a system consisting of 64 multiprocessors, 512 cores, and 8 TBs main memory.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Tim Kiefer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiefer:Tim", "Thomas Kissinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kissinger:Thomas", "Benjamin Schlegel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schlegel:Benjamin", "Dirk Habich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habich:Dirk", "Daniel Molka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Molka:Daniel", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang"], "pages": 4}
