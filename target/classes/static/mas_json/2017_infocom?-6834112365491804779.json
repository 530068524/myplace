{"title": "A 2D heterogeneous rendezvous protocol for multi-wideband cognitive radio networks.", "fields": ["wideband", "cognitive radio", "ranging", "channel", "rendezvous"], "abstract": "Ideally, users in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are capable of sensing and exploiting any potential transmission opportunities in the available spectrum band ranging from 30 KHz to 300 GHz. With the multiple-diverse-band spectrum, the network can provide more radio resources and capacity to a large number of CR users. However, the multiband scenario (e.g., TV band + 2/3G band + 4/5G band) also introduces significant challenges in channel rendezvous, a fundamental operation for users in CRNs to set up their communication link on a common channel. Existing studies on channel rendezvous suffer from unacceptable long delay and high energy consumption when applied to such scenarios. In this paper, we propose a two-dimensional heterogeneous rendezvous (2D-HR) protocol which can support multi-wideband CRNs (MWB-CRNs) with a significantly reduced rendezvous delay and energy consumption for various rendezvous scenarios, such as the pair-wise rendezvous, any-wise rendezvous, and multi-wise rendezvous. The proposed design also performs better than existing efforts even when dealing with traditional single-band rendezvous. The merits of 2D-HR are proved theoretically and validated against extensive simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses heterogeneous rendezvous in MWB-CRNs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "authors": ["Xingya Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xingya", "Jiang Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Jiang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
