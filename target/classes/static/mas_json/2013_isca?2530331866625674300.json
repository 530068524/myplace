Phase change memory (PCM) is one such candidate proposed for being part of the main memory in computing systems. One salient feature of PCM is its multi-level-cell (MLC) property, which can be used to multiply the memory capacity at the cell level. However, due to the nature of PCM that the value written to the cell can drift over time, PCM is prone to a unique type of soft errors, posing a great challenge for their practical deployment. This paper first quantitatively studied the current art for MLC PCM in dealing with the resistance drift problem and showed that the previously proposed techniques such as scrubbing or error correction mechanisms have significant reliability challenges to overcome. We then propose tri-level-cell PCM and demonstrate its ability to achieving  10   5   x lower soft error rate than four-level-cell PCM and 1.33 x higher information density than single-level-cell PCM. According to our findings, the tri-level-cell PCM shows 36.4% performance improvement over the four-level-cell PCM while achieving the soft error rate of DRAM.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Nak Hee Seong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seong:Nak_Hee", "Sungkap Yeo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeo:Sungkap", "Hsien-Hsin S.
