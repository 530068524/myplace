Most of the existing work in software analytics still relies heavily on costly manual feature engineering processes, and they mainly address the traditional classification problems, as opposed to predicting future events. We present a vision for DeepSoft, an end-to-end generic framework for modeling software and its development process to predict future risks and recommend interventions. DeepSoft, partly inspired by human memory, is built upon the powerful deep learning-based Long Short Term Memory architecture that is capable of learning long-term temporal dependencies that occur in software evolution. Such deep learned patterns of software can be used to address a range of challenging problems such as code and task recommendation and prediction. DeepSoft provides a new approach for research into modeling of source code, risk prediction and mitigation, developer modeling, and automatically generating code patches from bug reports.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Wollongong", "Deakin University", "Deakin University", "University of Wollongong"], "authors": ["Hoa Khanh Dam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dam:Hoa_Khanh", "Truyen Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran_0001:Truyen", "John C.
