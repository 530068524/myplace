{"title": "WatchWriter: Tap and Gesture Typing on a Smartwatch Miniature Keyboard with Statistical Decoding.", "fields": ["gesture", "word error rate", "adaptability", "smartwatch", "typing"], "abstract": "We present WatchWriter, a finger operated keyboard that supports both touch and gesture typing with statistical decoding on a smartwatch. Just like on modern smartphones, users type one letter per tap or one word per gesture stroke on WatchWriter but in a much smaller spatial scale. WatchWriter demonstrates that human motor control adaptability, coupled with modern statistical decoding and error correction technologies developed for smartphones, can enable a surprisingly effective typing performance despite the small watch size. In a user performance experiment entirely run on a smartwatch, 36 participants reached a speed of 22-24 WPM with near zero error rate.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mitchell Gordon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gordon:Mitchell", "Tom Ouyang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouyang:Tom", "Shumin Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Shumin"], "pages": 5}
