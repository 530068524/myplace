The decisional Linear Assumption was first introduced by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham in [5] as an alternative assumption for settings where the DDH problem is easy, such as bilinear groups. Shacham [25] and Hofheinz and Kiltz [16] independently introduced the generalized decisional  k -Linear Assumptions and showed that the decisional ( k +1)-Linear problem is hard for generic groups even when the decisional  k -Linear problem is easy. It is thus desirable to have constructions of cryptographic primitives based on the decisional  k -Linear Assumption instead of DDH. Not surprisingly, one must pay a small price for added security: as  k  increases, our constructed functions become slightly less efficient to compute and the key size increases (quadratically in  k ).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Allison B.
