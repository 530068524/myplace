{"title": "I Feel Like I'm Taking Selfies All Day!: Towards Understanding Biometric Authentication on Smartphones.", "fields": ["android", "biometrics", "internet privacy", "computer security", "usability"], "abstract": "We present the results of an MTurk survey (n=383) on the reasons for using and not using biometric authentication systems on smartphones. We focused on Apple's Touch ID as well as Android's Face Unlock as they are the most prevalent systems on the market. For both systems, we categorized the participants as a) current users, b) former users that deactivated it at some point and c) nonusers. The results show that usability is one of the main factors that influences the decision on whether or not to use biometric verification on the smartphone. To our surprise and as opposed to previous research on biometric authentication, privacy and trust issues were not among the most important decision factors.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alexander De Luca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luca:Alexander_De", "Alina Hang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hang:Alina", "Emanuel von Zezschwitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zezschwitz:Emanuel_von", "Heinrich Hussmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hussmann:Heinrich"], "pages": 4}
