Unfortunately, finding keypoints reliably and accurately remains a hard problem. In this paper we pose two questions. First, is it possible to exploit the gallery image in order to find keypoints in the probe image? For instance, consider finding the left eye in the probe image. Rather than using a generic eye model, we use a model that is informed by the appearance of the eye in the gallery image. To this end we develop a probabilistic model which combines recognition and keypoint localization. Second, is it necessary to localize keypoints? Alternatively we can consider keypoint position as a hidden variable which we marginalize over in a Bayesian manner. We demonstrate that both of these innovations improve performance relative to conventional methods in both frontal and cross-pose face recognition.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Peng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Peng", "Simon J.
