Instead of studying a specific scheduling policy, we provide a unified approach to tackle this issue. First we formalize a general LTE UL FDPS problem which is suitable for various scheduling policies. Then we prove that the problem is MAX SNP-hard, which implies that approximation algorithms with constant approximation ratios are the best that we can hope for. Therefore we design two approximation algorithms, both of which have polynomial runtime. Subsequently, we analyze the two algorithms and find their approximation ratios. The first algorithm is easy to follow, since it is based on a simple greedy method. The second one is based on the local ratio technique and it can approximately solve the LTE UL FDPS problem with a approximation ratio of 2.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Hongkun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Hongkun", "Fengyuan Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Fengyuan", "Chuang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chuang", "Jiao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jiao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
