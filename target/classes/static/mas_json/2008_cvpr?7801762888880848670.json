{"title": "Face alignment via boosted ranking model.", "fields": ["ranking", "training set", "image registration", "facial recognition system", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Face alignment seeks to deform a face model to match it with the features of the image of a face by optimizing an appropriate cost function. We propose a new face model that is aligned by maximizing a score function, which we learn from training data, and that we impose to be concave. We show that this problem can be reduced to learning a classifier that is able to say whether or not by switching from one alignment to a new one, the model is approaching the correct fitting. This relates to the ranking problem where a number of instances need to be ordered. For training the model, we propose to extend GentleBoost [23] to rank-learning. Extensive experimentation shows the superiority of this approach to other learning paradigms, and demonstrates that this model exceeds the alignment performance of the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "General Electric", "General Electric"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Hao", "Xiaoming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Xiaoming", "Gianfranco Doretto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doretto:Gianfranco"], "pages": -1}
