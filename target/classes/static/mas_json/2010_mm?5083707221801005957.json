{"title": "Optimal collusion attack for digital fingerprinting.", "fields": ["interrupt", "spread spectrum", "voronoi diagram", "collusion", "cost efficiency"], "abstract": "The collusion attack is a cost-efficient attack against digital finger-printing where classes of users combine their fingerprinted content for the purpose of attenuating or removing the fingerprints. A recently introduced gradient attack which appeared in ACM MM 2004, demonstrated its efficacy in defeating most spread-spectrum based fingerprints. In this paper, we propose a novel collusion attack strategy,  Iterative Optimization Collusion Attack (IOCA) , which is based upon the gradient attack and the geometric principal of a Voronoi diagram. The simulation results, under the assumption that orthogonal fingerprints are used, show that the proposed collusion attack performs more effectively than the gradient attack. Less than five fingerprinted pieces of content can sufficiently interrupt orthogonal fingerprints accommodating many thousands of users, meanwhile, high perceptual quality of the attacked content is obtained after the proposed collusion attack.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Queen's University Belfast", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Hui Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Hui", "Hefei Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Hefei", "Fuhao Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou:Fuhao", "WeiQi Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan_0001:WeiQi", "Zhengding Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhengding"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
