We analyze and compare the energy efficiency of different architectural options for the location of video processing functions and illustrate how the architecture of choice is influenced by the network topology, the users' view preferences, and the relative transport-processing energy efficiency. We provide an integer linear programming formulation for the energy efficient functional resource allocation problem, which we show it can be solved as a linear program, and an easily implementable algorithm that generates optimal solutions in polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Jaime Llorca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Llorca:Jaime", "Kyle Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Kyle", "Gary Atkinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atkinson:Gary", "Daniel C.
