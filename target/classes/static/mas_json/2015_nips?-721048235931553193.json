{"title": "Sparse Local Embeddings for Extreme Multi-label Classification.", "fields": ["data set", "multi label classification", "pairwise comparison", "embedding", "linear subspace"], "abstract": "The objective in extreme multi-label learning is to train a classifier that can automatically tag a novel data point with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set. Embedding based approaches attempt to make training and prediction tractable by assuming that the training label matrix is low-rank and reducing the effective number of labels by projecting the high dimensional label vectors onto a low dimensional linear subspace. Still, leading embedding approaches have been unable to deliver high prediction accuracies, or scale to large problems as the low rank assumption is violated in most real world applications.\n\nIn this paper we develop the SLEEC classifier to address both limitations. The main technical contribution in SLEEC is a formulation for learning a small ensemble of local distance preserving embeddings which can accurately predict infrequently occurring (tail) labels. This allows SLEEC to break free of the traditional low-rank assumption and boost classification accuracy by learning embeddings which preserve pairwise distances between only the nearest label vectors.\n\nWe conducted extensive experiments on several real-world, as well as benchmark data sets and compared our method against state-of-the-art methods for extreme multi-label classification. Experiments reveal that SLEEC can make significantly more accurate predictions then the state-of-the-art methods including both embedding-based (by as much as 35%) as well as tree-based (by as much as 6%) methods. SLEEC can also scale efficiently to data sets with a million labels which are beyond the pale of leading embedding methods.", "citation": "Citations (117)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kush Bhatia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhatia:Kush", "Himanshu Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Himanshu", "Purushottam Kar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kar:Purushottam", "Manik Varma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varma:Manik", "Prateek Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0002:Prateek"], "pages": 9}
