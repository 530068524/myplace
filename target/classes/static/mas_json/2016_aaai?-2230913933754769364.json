{"title": "Toward a Taxonomy and Computational Models of Abnormalities in Images.", "fields": ["taxonomy", "computational model", "abnormality", "image processing", "human visual system model"], "abstract": "The human visual system can spot an abnormal image, and reason about what makes it strange. This task has not received enough attention in computer vision. In this paper we study various types of atypicalities in images in a more comprehensive way than has been done before. We propose a new dataset of abnormal images showing a wide range of atypicalities. We design human subject experiments to discover a coarse taxonomy of the reasons for abnormality. Our experiments reveal three major categories of abnormality: object-centric, scene-centric, and contextual. Based on this taxonomy, we propose a comprehensive computational model that can predict all different types of abnormality in images and outperform prior arts in abnormality recognition.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Babak Saleh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saleh:Babak", "Ahmed M.
