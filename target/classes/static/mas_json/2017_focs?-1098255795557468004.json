This result can be viewed either positively or negatively: either we will develop nearly-linear time algorithms for solving all systems of linear equations over the reals, or progress on the families we can solve in nearly-linear time will soon halt.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Yale University", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Rasmus Kyng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kyng:Rasmus", "Peng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Peng"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
