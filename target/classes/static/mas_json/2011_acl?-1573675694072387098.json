{"title": "Using Cross-Entity Inference to Improve Event Extraction.", "fields": ["transduction", "pattern recognition", "inference", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Event extraction is the task of detecting certain specified types of events that are mentioned in the source language data. The state-of-the-art research on the task is transductive inference (e.g. cross-event inference). In this paper, we propose a new method of event extraction by well using cross-entity inference. In contrast to previous inference methods, we regard entity-type consistency as key feature to predict event mentions. We adopt this inference method to improve the traditional sentence-level event extraction system. Experiments show that we can get 8.6% gain in trigger (event) identification, and more than 11.8% gain for argument (role) classification in ACE event extraction.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Soochow University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yu Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Yu", "Jianfeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jianfeng", "Bin Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Bin", "Jian-Min Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Jian=Min", "Guodong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guodong", "Qiaoming Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Qiaoming"], "pages": 10}
