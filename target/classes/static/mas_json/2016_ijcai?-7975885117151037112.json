A robust multi-view tagging method must have the capability to meet the two challenging requirements: limited labeled training samples and noisy labeled training samples. In this paper, we investigate this challenging problem of learning with limited and noisy tagging and propose a discriminative model, called MSMC, that exploits both labeled and unlabeled data through a semi-parametric regularization and takes advantage of the multi-label space consistency into the optimization. While MSMC is a general method for learning with multi-view, limited, and noisy tagging, in the evaluations we focus on the specific application of noisy image tagging with limited labeled training samples on a benchmark dataset. Extensive evaluations in comparison with state-of-the-art literature demonstrate that MSMC outstands with a superior performance.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Zhejiang University", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yingming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yingming", "Ming Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ming", "Zenglin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zenglin", "Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhongfei_=Mark="], "pages": 7}
