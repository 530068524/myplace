However, due to its complicated nature, it is technically challenging to effectively model and store the captured motion data. In this paper, we present a set of algorithms to construct geometry videos for 3D facial expressions, including hole filling, geodesic-based face segmentation, and expression-invariant parametrization. Our algorithms are efficient and robust, and can guarantee the exact correspondence of the salient features (eyes, mouth and nose). Geometry video naturally bridges the 3D motion data and 2D video, and provides a way to borrow the well-studied video processing techniques to motion data processing. With our proposed intra-frame prediction scheme based on H.264/AVC, we are able to compress the geometry videos into a very compact size while maintaining the video quality. Our experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that geometry video is effective for modeling the high-resolution 3D expression data.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Jiazhi Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Jiazhi", "Ying He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Ying", "Dao Thi Phuong Quynh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quynh:Dao_Thi_Phuong", "Xiaoming Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiaoming", "Steven C.
