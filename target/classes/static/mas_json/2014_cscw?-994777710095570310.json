Consistently, \"digital volunteers\" and others are coming together to filter and process this data into usable resources, often coordinating their work within distributed online groups. However, current tools and practices are frequently unable to keep up with the speed and volume of incoming data during large events. Through contextual interviews with emergency response professionals and digital volunteers, this research examines the ad hoc, collaborative practices that have emerged to help process this data and outlines strategies for supporting and leveraging these efforts in future designs. We argue for solutions that align with current group values, work practices, volunteer motivations, and organizational structures, but also allow these groups to increase the scale and efficiency of their operations.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Camille Cobb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cobb:Camille", "Ted McCarthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCarthy:Ted", "Annuska Perkins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perkins:Annuska", "Ankitha Bharadwaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bharadwaj:Ankitha", "Jared Comis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Comis:Jared", "Brian Do.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Do:Brian", "Kate Starbird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Starbird:Kate"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
