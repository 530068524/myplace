To verify complex software systems, test and analysis techniques shall deal with the many aspects of the target systems at different granularity levels. In particular, testing software programs that make extensive use of heap data structures at unit and integration levels requires generating suitable input data structures in the heap. This is a main challenge for symbolic testing and analysis techniques that work well when dealing with numeric inputs, but do not satisfactorily cope with heap data structures yet. In this paper we propose a language HEX to specify invariants of partially initialized data structures, and a decision procedure that supports the incremental evaluation of structural properties in HEX. Used in combination with the symbolic execution of heap manipulating programs, HEX prevents the exploration of invalid states, thus improving the eefficiency of program testing and analysis, and avoiding false alarms that negatively impact on verication activities. The experimental data conrm that HEX is an effective and efficient solution to the problem of testing and analyzing heap manipulating programs, and outperforms the alternative approaches that have been proposed so far.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Milano-Bicocca", "University of Milano-Bicocca", "University of Milano-Bicocca"], "authors": ["Pietro Braione.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braione:Pietro", "Giovanni Denaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denaro:Giovanni", "Mauro Pezz\u00e8.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pezz=egrave=:Mauro"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
