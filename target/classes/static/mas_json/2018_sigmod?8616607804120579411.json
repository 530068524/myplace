{"title": "FastQRE: Fast Query Reverse Engineering.", "fields": ["reverse engineering", "database", "sql", "computer science", "orders of magnitude"], "abstract": "We study the problem of  Query Reverse Engineering  (QRE), where given a database and an output table, the task is to find a simple project-join SQL query that generates that table when applied on the database. This problem is known for its efficiency challenge due to mainly two reasons. First, the problem has a very large search space and its various variants are known to be NP-hard. Second, executing even a single candidate SQL query can be very computationally expensive. In this work we propose a novel approach for solving the QRE problem efficiently. Our solution outperforms the existing state of the art by 2-3 orders of magnitude for complex queries, resolving those queries in seconds rather than days, thus making our approach more practical in real-life settings.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["AT&T Labs", "University of British Columbia", "AT&T Labs"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Dmitri V.
