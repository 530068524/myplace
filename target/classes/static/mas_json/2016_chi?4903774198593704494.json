{"title": "SkinTrack: Using the Body as an Electrical Waveguide for Continuous Finger Tracking on the Skin.", "fields": ["group delay and phase delay", "wearable computer", "touchscreen", "finger tracking", "smartwatch"], "abstract": "SkinTrack is a wearable system that enables continuous touch tracking on the skin. It consists of a ring, which emits a continuous high frequency AC signal, and a sensing wristband with multiple electrodes. Due to the phase delay inherent in a high-frequency AC signal propagating through the body, a phase difference can be observed between pairs of electrodes. SkinTrack measures these phase differences to compute a 2D finger touch coordinate. Our approach can segment touch events at 99% accuracy, and resolve the 2D location of touches with a mean error of 7.6mm. As our approach is compact, non-invasive, low-cost and low-powered, we envision the technology being integrated into future smartwatches, supporting rich touch interactions beyond the confines of the small touchscreen.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yang", "Junhan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Junhan", "Gierad Laput.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laput:Gierad", "Chris Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Chris"], "pages": 13}
