{"title": "Word Embedding based Generalized Language Model for Information Retrieval.", "fields": ["word embedding", "vocabulary mismatch", "word2vec", "baseline", "tf idf"], "abstract": "Word2vec, a state-of-the-art word embedding technique has gained a lot of interest in the NLP community. The embedding of the word vectors helps to retrieve a list of words that are used in similar contexts with respect to a given word. In this paper, we focus on using the word embeddings for enhancing retrieval effectiveness. In particular, we construct a generalized language model, where the mutual independence between a pair of words (say t and t') no longer holds. Instead, we make use of the vector embeddings of the words to derive the transformation probabilities between words. Specifically, the event of observing a term t in the query from a document d is modeled by two distinct events, that of generating a different term t', either from the document itself or from the collection, respectively, and then eventually transforming it to the observed query term t. The first event of generating an intermediate term from the document intends to capture how well does a term contextually fit within a document, whereas the second one of generating it from the collection aims to address the vocabulary mismatch problem by taking into account other related terms in the collection. Our experiments, conducted on the standard TREC collection, show that our proposed method yields significant improvements over LM and LDA-smoothed LM baselines.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["Dublin City University", "Indian Statistical Institute", "Indian Statistical Institute", "Dublin City University"], "authors": ["Debasis Ganguly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganguly:Debasis", "Dwaipayan Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Dwaipayan", "Mandar Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Mandar", "Gareth J.
