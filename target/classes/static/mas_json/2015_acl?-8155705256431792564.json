{"title": "Entity Hierarchy Embedding.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "semantic similarity", "metric", "embedding", "entity linking"], "abstract": "Existing distributed representations are limited in utilizing structured knowledge to improve semantic relatedness modeling. We propose a principled framework of embedding entities that integrates hierarchical information from large-scale knowledge bases. The novel embedding model associates each category node of the hierarchy with a distance metric. To capture structured semantics, the entity similarity of context prediction are measured under the aggregated metrics of relevant categories along all inter-entity paths. We show that both the entity vectors and category distance metrics encode meaningful semantics. Experiments in entity linking and entity search show superiority of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhiting Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Zhiting", "Poyao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Poyao", "Yuntian Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Yuntian", "Yingkai Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yingkai", "Eric P.
