{"title": "Segment-Level Sequence Modeling using Gated Recursive Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields.", "fields": ["chunking", "conditional random field", "convolutional neural network", "named entity recognition", "recursion"], "abstract": "Most of the sequence tagging tasks in natural language processing require to recognize segments with certain syntactic role or semantic meaning in a sentence. They are usually tackled with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which do indirect word-level modeling over word-level features and thus cannot make full use of segment-level information. Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (Semi-CRFs) model segments directly but extracting segment-level features for Semi-CRFs is still a very challenging problem. This paper presents Gated Recursive Semi-CRFs (grSemi-CRFs), which model segments directly and automatically learn segmentlevel features through a gated recursive convolutional neural network. Our experiments on text chunking and named entity recognition (NER) demonstrate that grSemi-CRFs generally outperform other neural models.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jingwei Zhuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuo:Jingwei", "Yong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yong", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Bo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0010:Bo", "Zaiqing Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Zaiqing"], "pages": -1}
