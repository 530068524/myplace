In this paper, we suggest to decompose convolutional filters in CNN as a truncated expansion with pre-fixed bases, namely the Decomposed Convolutional Filters network (DCFNet), where the expansion coefficients remain learned from data. Such a structure not only reduces the number of trainable parameters and computation, but also imposes filter regularity by bases truncation. Through extensive experiments, we consistently observe that DCFNet maintains accuracy for image classification tasks with a significant reduction of model parameters, particularly with Fourier-Bessel (FB) bases, and even with random bases. Theoretically, we analyze the representation stability of DCFNet with respect to input variations, and prove representation stability under generic assumptions on the expansion coefficients. The analysis is consistent with the empirical observations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Qiang Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Qiang", "Xiuyuan Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiuyuan", "A.
