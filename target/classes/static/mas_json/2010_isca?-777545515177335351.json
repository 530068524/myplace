A promising method to facilitate debugging parallel program is using hardware support to achieve deterministic replay. A hardware-assisted deterministic replay scheme should have a small log size, as well as low design cost, to be feasible for adopting by industrial processors. To achieve the goals, we propose a novel and succinct hardware-assisted deterministic replay scheme named LReplay. The key innovation of LReplay is that instead of recording the logical time orders between instructions or instruction blocks as previous investigations, LReplay is built upon recording the pending period information [6]. According to the experimental results on Godson-3, the overall log size of LReplay is about 0.55B/K-Inst (byte per k-instruction) for sequential consistency, and 0.85B/K-Inst for Godson-3 consistency. The log size is smaller in an order of magnitude than state-of-art deterministic replay schemes incuring no performance loss. Furthermore, LReplay only consumes about $1.3%$ area of Godson-3, since it requires only trivial modifications to the existing components of Godson-3. The above features of LReplay demonstrate the potential of integrating hardware-assisted deterministic replay into future industrial processors.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Yunji Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yunji", "Weiwu Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Weiwu", "Tianshi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Tianshi", "Ruiyang Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ruiyang"], "pages": 11}
