However, model selection---even choosing the number of nodes---remains an open question. Recent work has proposed the use of a horseshoe prior over node pre-activations of a Bayesian neural network, which effectively turns off nodes that do not help explain the data. In this work, we propose several modeling and inference advances that consistently improve the compactness of the model learned while maintaining predictive performance, especially in smaller-sample settings including reinforcement learning.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["IBM", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Soumya Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Soumya", "Jiayu Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Jiayu", "Finale Doshi-Velez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doshi=Velez:Finale"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
