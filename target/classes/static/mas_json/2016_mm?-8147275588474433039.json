{"title": "Multimodal-based Multimedia Analysis, Retrieval, and Services in Support of Social Media Applications.", "fields": ["social media", "metadata", "multimedia", "semantics", "modalities"], "abstract": "The rapid growth in the amount of user-generated content (UGCs) online necessitates for social media companies to automatically extract knowledge structures (concepts) from user-generated images (UGIs) and user-generated videos (UGVs) to provide diverse multimedia-related services. For instance, recommending preference-aware multimedia content, the understanding of semantics and sentics from UGCs, and automatically computing tag relevance for UGIs are benefited from knowledge structures extracted from multiple modalities. Since contextual information captured by modern devices in conjunction with a media item greatly helps in its understanding, we leverage both multimedia content and contextual information (eg., spatial and temporal metadata) to address above-mentioned social media problems in our doctoral research. We present our approaches, results, and works in progress on these problems.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Rajiv Ratn Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Rajiv_Ratn"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 5}
