{"title": "GraphCAR: Content-aware Multimedia Recommendation with Graph Autoencoder.", "fields": ["web service", "graph", "multimedia", "autoencoder", "collaborative filtering"], "abstract": "Precisely recommending relevant multimedia items from massive candidates to a large number of users is an indispensable yet difficult task on many platforms. A promising way is to project users and items into a latent space and recommend items via the inner product of latent factor vectors. However, previous studies paid little attention to the multimedia content itself and couldn't make the best use of preference data like implicit feedback. To fill this gap, we propose a Content-aware Multimedia Recommendation Model with Graph Autoencoder (GraphCAR), combining informative multimedia content with user-item interaction. Specifically, user-item interaction, user attributes and multimedia contents (e.g., images, videos, audios, etc.) are taken as input of the autoencoder to generate the item preference scores for each user. Through extensive experiments on two real-world multimedia Web services: Amazon and Vine, we show that GraphCAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques of both collaborative filtering and content-based methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of East Anglia", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Qidi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Qidi", "Fumin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Fumin", "Li Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0004:Li", "Heng Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Heng_Tao"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
