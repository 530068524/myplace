{"title": "MobTorrent: A Framework for Mobile Internet Access from Vehicles.", "fields": ["internet access", "instruction prefetch", "mobile radio", "control channel", "wireless wan"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present MobTorrent, an on- demand, user-driven framework designed for vehicles which have intermittent high speed access to roadside WiFi access points (AP). Mobile nodes in MobTorrent use the WWAN network as a control channel. When a mobile client wants to initiate a down- load, instead of waiting for contact with the AP, it informs one (or multiple) selected AP(s) to prefetch the content. The scheduling algorithm in MobTorrent then replicates the prefetched data on the mobile helpers so that the total amount of data transferred and the average transfer rate to the mobile clients are maximized. Therefore, instead of limiting high speed data transfer to the short contact periods between APs and mobile clients, high speed transfers among vehicles are opportunistically exploited. Evaluation based on testbed measurement and trace-driven simulation shows that MobTorrent provides substantial improve- ment over existing architectures. For the case of a single AP, its performance approximates that of an off-line optimal scheduler. In case of multiple APs, our evaluation shows that MobTorrent's performance is robust in a variety of settings.", "citation": "Citations (151)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Bin Bin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bin_Bin", "Mun Choon Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Mun_Choon"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
