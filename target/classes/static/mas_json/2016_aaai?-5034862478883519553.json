{"title": "A Combinatorial Search Perspective on Diverse Solution Generation.", "fields": ["satisficing", "existential quantification", "combinatorial search", "constraint programming", "completeness"], "abstract": "Finding diverse solutions has become important in many combinatorial search domains, including Automated Planning, Path Planning and Constraint Programming. Much of the work in these directions has however focussed on coming up with appropriate diversity metrics and compiling those metrics in to the solvers/planners. Most approaches use linear-time greedy algorithms for exploring the state space of solution combinations for generating a diverse set of solutions, limiting not only their completeness but also their effectiveness within a time bound. In this paper, we take a combinatorial search perspective on generating diverse solutions. We present a generic bi-level optimization framework for finding cost-sensitive diverse solutions. We propose complete methods under this framework, which guarantee finding a set of cost sensitive diverse solutions satisficing the given criteria whenever there exists such a set. We identify various aspects that affect the performance of these exhaustive algorithms and propose techniques to improve them. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed framework compared to an existing greedy approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Satya Gautam Vadlamudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vadlamudi:Satya_Gautam", "Subbarao Kambhampati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kambhampati:Subbarao"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
