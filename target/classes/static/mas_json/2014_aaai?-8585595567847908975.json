{"title": "Boosting SBDS for Partial Symmetry Breaking in Constraint Programming.", "fields": ["dynamic method", "soundness", "rectification", "constraint programming", "recursion"], "abstract": "The paper proposes a dynamic method, Recursive SBDS (ReSBDS), for efficient partial symmetry breaking. We first demonstrate how (partial) Symmetry Breaking During Search (SBDS) misses important pruning opportunities when given only a subset of symmetries to break. The investigation pinpoints the culprit and in turn suggests rectification. The main idea is to add extra conditional constraints during search recursively to prune also symmetric nodes of some pruned subtrees. Thus, ReSBDS can break extra symmetry compositions, but is carefully designed to break only the ones that are easy to identify and inexpensive to break. We present theorems to guarantee the soundness and termination of our approach, and compare our method with popular static and dynamic methods. When the variable (value) heuristic is static, ReSBDS is also complete in eliminating all interchangeable variables (values) given only the generator symmetries. Extensive experimentations confirm the efficiency of ReSBDS, when compared against state of the art methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Jimmy H.
