{"title": "visKQWL, a visual renderer for a semantic web query language.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "personal wiki", "web query classification", "semantic web stack", "web search query"], "abstract": "KiWi is a semantic Wiki that combines the Wiki philosophy of collaborative content creation with the methods of the Semantic Web in order to enable effective knowledge management.   Querying a Wiki must be simple enough for beginning users, yet powerful enough to accommodate experienced users.   To this end, the keyword-based KiWi query language (KWQL) supports queries ranging from simple lists of keywords to expressive rules for selecting and reshaping Wiki (meta-)data.   In this demo, we showcase visKWQL, a visual interface for the KWQL language aimed at supporting users in the query construction process. visKWQL and its editor are described, and their functionality is illustrated using example queries.   visKWQL's editor provides guidance throughout the query construction process through hints, warnings and highlighting of syntactic errors.   The editor enables round-tripping between the twin languages KWQL and visKWQL, meaning that users can switch freely between the textual and visual form when constructing or editing a query. It is implemented using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and can thus be used in (almost) any web browser without any additional software.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "authors": ["Andreas Hartl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartl:Andreas", "Klara A.
