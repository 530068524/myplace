Such growing datasets lead to ever-increasing space and performance overheads for maintaining and accessing indexes. Furthermore, there is often considerable skew with popular users and recent data accessed much more frequently. These observations led us to design Shinobi, a system which uses horizontal partitioning as a mechanism for improving query performance to cluster the physical data, and increasing insert performance by only indexing data that is frequently accessed. We present database design algorithms that optimally partition tables, drop indexes from partitions that are infrequently queried, and maintain these partitions as workloads change. We show a 60\u00d7 performance improvement over traditionally indexed tables using a real-world query workload derived from a traffic monitoring application", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Eugene Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0002:Eugene", "Samuel Madden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madden:Samuel"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
