{"title": "Statistical Analysis of Semi-Supervised Learning: The Limit of Infinite Unlabelled Data.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "semi supervised learning", "regularization", "laplace operator", "eigenvalues and eigenvectors"], "abstract": "We study the behavior of the popular Laplacian Regularization method for Semi-Supervised Learning at the regime of a fixed number of labeled points but a large number of unlabeled points. We show that in $\\R^d$, $d \\geq 2$, the method is actually not well-posed, and as the number of unlabeled points increases the solution degenerates to a noninformative function. We also contrast the method with the Laplacian Eigenvector method, and discuss the ``smoothness assumptions associated with this alternate method.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Boaz Nadler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nadler:Boaz", "Nathan Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nathan", "Xueyuan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xueyuan"], "pages": 9}
