(i) We prove that k-party set disjointness has communication complexity Omega(n/4 k ) 1/4  in the randomized and nondeterministic models and Omega(n/4 k ) 1/8  in the Merlin-Arthur model. These lower bounds are close to tight. Previous lower bounds (2007-2008) for k>=3 parties were weaker than Omega(n/2 k 3  ) 1/(k+1)  in all three models.   (ii) We prove that solving l instances of set disjointness requires l*Omega(n/4 k ) 1/4  bits of communication, even to achieve correctness probability exponentially close to 1/2. This gives the first direct-product result for multiparty set disjointness, solving an open problem due to Beame, Pitassi, Segerlind, and Wigderson (2005).   (iii) We construct a read-once {\u2227,\u2228}-circuit of depth 3 with exponentially small discrepancy for up to k\u2248(1/2)log n parties. This result is optimal with respect to depth and solves an open problem due to Beame and Huynh-Ngoc (FOCS '09), who gave a depth-6 construction.
