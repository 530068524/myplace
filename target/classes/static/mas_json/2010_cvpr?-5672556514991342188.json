We make three contributions: (a) we propose computationally efficient algorithms to extract GSS descriptors for classification. These capture the spatial arrangements of self-similarities within the entire image; (b) we show how to use these descriptors efficiently for detection in a sliding-window framework and in a branch-and-bound framework; (c) we experimentally demonstrate on Pascal VOC 2007 and on ETHZ Shape Classes that GSS outperforms LSS for both classification and detection, and that GSS descriptors are complementary to conventional descriptors such as gradients or color.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Thomas Deselaers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deselaers:Thomas", "Vittorio Ferrari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferrari:Vittorio"], "pages": 8}
