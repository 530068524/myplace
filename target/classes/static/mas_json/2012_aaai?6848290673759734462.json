We compare four variants of this approach with a baseline random sampling algorithm, as well as other complete and incomplete algorithms for DCOPs. Under general assumptions, we theoretically show that the solution found by DUCT after  T  steps is approximately  T  \u22121 -close to the optimal. Experimentally, we show that DUCT matches the optimal solution found by the well-known DPOP and O-DPOP algorithms on moderate-size problems, while always requiring less agent communication. For larger problems, where DPOP fails, we show that DUCT produces significantly better solutions than local, incomplete algorithms. Overall, we believe that DUCT is a practical, scalable algorithm for complex DCOPs.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Chalmers University of Technology", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Booking.com"], "authors": ["Brammert Ottens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ottens:Brammert", "Christos Dimitrakakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dimitrakakis:Christos", "Boi Faltings.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faltings:Boi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
