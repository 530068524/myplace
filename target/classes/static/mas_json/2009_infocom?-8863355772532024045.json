STUMP uses propagation delay information to overlap node communication and increase channel utilization. STUMP also provides an upper bound on the performance of many ad hoc MAC protocols previously proposed for underwater networks. Our work yields several important conclusions. First, leveraging node position diversity through scheduling yields large improvements in channel utilization. Second, STUMP does not require tight node synchronization to achieve high channel utilization, allowing nodes to use simple or more energy efficient synchronization protocols. Third, CDMA, a technique commonly proposed for underwater networks, provides no benefit to scheduled MAC protocols when using realistic spreading values. CDMA, however, still provides other benefits in underwater networks, so our work does not attempt to argue against using CDMA. Finally, we briefly present and evaluate distributed and centralized algorithms that derive STUMP schedules.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Kurtis B.
