{"title": "Efficient Query Rewriting in the Description Logic EL and Beyond.", "fields": ["rewriting", "datalog", "query rewriting", "ontology", "description logic"], "abstract": "We propose a new type of algorithm for computing first-order (FO) rewritings of concept queries under ELHdr-TBoxes. The algorithm is tailored towards efficient implementation, yet complete. It outputs a succinct non-recursive datalog rewriting if the input is FO-rewritable and otherwise reports non-FO-rewritability. We carry out experiments with realworld ontologies which demonstrate excellent performance in practice and show that TBoxes originating from applications admit FO-rewritings of reasonable size in almost all cases, even when in theory such rewritings are not guaranteed to exist.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "University of Liverpool"], "authors": ["Peter Hansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hansen_0002:Peter", "Carsten Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutz:Carsten", "Inan\u00e7 Seylan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seylan:Inan=ccedil=", "Frank Wolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolter:Frank"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
