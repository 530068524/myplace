{"title": "From Datalog to flix: a declarative language for fixed points on lattices.", "fields": ["declarative programming", "datalog", "least fixed point", "logic programming", "evaluation strategy"], "abstract": "We present Flix, a declarative programming language for specifying and solving least fixed point problems, particularly static program analyses. Flix is inspired by Datalog and extends it with lattices and monotone functions. Using Flix, implementors of static analyses can express a broader range of analyses than is currently possible in pure Datalog, while retaining its familiar rule-based syntax. We define a model-theoretic semantics of Flix as a natural extension of the Datalog semantics. This semantics captures the declarative meaning of Flix programs without imposing any specific evaluation strategy. An efficient strategy is semi-naive evaluation which we adapt for Flix. We have implemented a compiler and runtime for Flix, and used it to express several well-known static analyses, including the IFDS and IDE algorithms. The declarative nature of Flix clearly exposes the similarity between these two algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Magnus Madsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madsen:Magnus", "Ming-Ho Yee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yee:Ming=Ho", "Ondrej Lhot\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lhot=aacute=k:Ondrej"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2016", "pages": 15}
