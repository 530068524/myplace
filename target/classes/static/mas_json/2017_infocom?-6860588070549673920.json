{"title": "CubeX: Leveraging glocality of cube-based networks for RAM-based key-value store.", "fields": ["node", "backup", "exploit", "associative array", "file server"], "abstract": "RAM-based storage aggregates the RAM of servers in data center networks (DCN) to provide extremely high storage performance. For quick recovery of storage server failures, Mem-Cube [1] exploits the proximity of the BCube network to limit the recovery traffic to the recovery servers' 1-hop neighborhood. However, previous design is applicable only to BCube, and has suboptimal recovery performance due to congestion and contention. To address these problems, in this paper we propose CubeX, which generalizes the \u201c1-hop\u201d principle of MemCube for all cube-based networks, and improves the throughput and recovery performance of RAM-based key-value (KV) store via cross-layer optimizations. At the core of CubeX is to leverage the glocality (= globality + locality) of cube-based networks: it scatters backup data across a large number of disks globally distributed throughout the cube, and restricts all recovery traffic within the small local range of each server node. Our evaluation shows that CubeX efficiently supports RAM-based KV store for cube-based networks, and CubeX remarkably outperforms MemCube in both throughput and recovery time.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "Central South University"], "authors": ["Yiming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yiming", "Dongsheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dongsheng", "Tian Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Tian", "Ping Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Ping"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
