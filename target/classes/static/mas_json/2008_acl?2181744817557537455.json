In this paper, we show how these results can be exploited to improve parsing accuracy by integrating a graph-based and a transition-based model. By letting one model generate features for the other, we consistently improve accuracy for both models, resulting in a significant improvement of the state of the art when evaluated on data sets from the CoNLL-X shared task.", "citation": "Citations (265)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Google", "Computer Scienc ... s and Philology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Joakim Nivre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nivre:Joakim", "Ryan T.
