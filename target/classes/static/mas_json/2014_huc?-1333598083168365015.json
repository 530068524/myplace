While quite a few air quality monitoring stations have been built by governments in a city's public areas, the indoor PM2.5 has not yet been monitored and dealt with effectively. Though many office buildings have an HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system, PM2.5 is not considered as a factor when the system circulates fresh air from outdoors. This paper introduces a real system that we have deployed in the offices of four Microsoft campuses in China. This system instantly monitors indoor air quality on different floors of a building (including office areas, gyms, garages, and restaurants), enabling Microsoft employees to enquire the air quality of a place by using a mobile phone or checking a website. The information can guide a user's decision making, e.g., finding the right time to work out in the gym or turn on individual air filters in her own office. Through analyzing the indoor and outdoor air quality data collected over a long period, our system can even offer actionable and energy-efficient suggestion to HVAC systems, e.g., automatically turning on the system only a few hours earlier than usual if it is a heavily polluted day, or identifying the filters in HVAC system that should be renewed.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Microsoft", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Xuxu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xuxu", "Yu Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0004:Yu", "Yubiao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yubiao", "Qiwei Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Qiwei", "Weiwei Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Weiwei", "Eric Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Eric", "Wei-Ying Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Wei=Ying"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 5}
