This is the result of performance impairments encountered in the past when running on the same system, the workloads becoming ever more sophisticated, leading to contradictory optimization in database design. Recent developments in hardware and database systems are bringing forth research prototypes supporting mixed OLTP and OLAP workloads, challenging this separation. At the same time new benchmarks are proposed to assess these mixed workload systems. In the demonstration, we show an interactive performance monitor and benchmark driver developed for the Composite Benchmark for Transaction Processing and Reporting. The performance monitor allows us to directly determine the impact of changing shares within the workload and to interactively assess behavioral characteristics of different database systems under changing mixed workload conditions.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Anja Bog.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bog:Anja", "Kai Sachs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sachs:Kai", "Hasso Plattner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plattner:Hasso"], "pages": 4}
