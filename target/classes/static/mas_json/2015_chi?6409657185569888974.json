{"title": "New Interaction Tools for Preserving an Old Language.", "fields": ["multimedia", "fabrication", "knowledge transfer", "jungle", "sentence"], "abstract": "The Penan people of Malaysian Borneo were traditionally nomads of the rainforest. They would leave messages in the jungle for each other by shaping natural objects into language tokens and arranging these symbols in specific ways -- much like words in a sentence. With settlement, the language is being lost as it is not being used by the younger generation. We report here, a tangible system designed to help the Penan preserve their unique object writing language. The key features of the system are that: its tangibles are made of real objects; it works in the wild; and new tangibles can be fabricated and added to the system by the users. Our evaluations show that the system is engaging and encourages intergenerational knowledge transfer and thus has the potential to help preserve this language.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Universiti Malaysia Sarawak", "National University of Singapore", "Universiti Malaysia Sarawak"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Beryl Plimmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plimmer:Beryl", "Liang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Liang", "Tariq Zaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaman:Tariq", "Kasun Karunanayaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karunanayaka:Kasun", "Alvin W.
