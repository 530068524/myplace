We consider a number of recent domain transfer methods from machine learning, including some that are novel, and evaluate them on genomic sequence data from model organisms of varying evolutionary distance. We find that in cases where the organisms are not closely related, the use of domain adaptation methods can help improve classification performance.", "citation": "Citations (124)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "University of T\u00fcbingen", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Gabriele Beate Schweikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schweikert:Gabriele_Beate", "Christian Widmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Widmer:Christian", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard", "Gunnar R\u00e4tsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=tsch:Gunnar"], "pages": 8}
