First, we propose a method to automatically generate a data set, which uses click-through logs of the Yahoo! Search Engine to derive the language of a query indirectly from the language of the documents clicked by the users. Next, we use this data set to train two decision tree classifiers; one that only uses linguistic features and is aimed for textual language identification, and one that additionally uses a non-linguistic feature, and is geared towards the identification of the language intended by the users of the search engine. Our results show that our method produces a highly reliable data set very efficiently, and our decision tree classifier outperforms some of the best methods that have been proposed for the task of written language identification on the domain of search engine queries.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of North Texas", "Los Angeles Mission College"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hakan Ceylan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceylan:Hakan", "Yookyung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Yookyung"], "pages": 9}
