Given observation and state transition models, the Kalman Filter (KF) recursively estimates the state variables of a dynamic system. However, the KF requires a cubic time matrix inversion operation at every timestep which prevents its application in domains with large numbers of state variables. We propose Relational Gaussian Models to represent and model dynamic systems with large numbers of variables efficiently. Furthermore, we devise an exact lifted Kalman Filtering algorithm which takes only linear time in the number of random variables at every timestep. We prove that our algorithm takes linear time in the number of state variables even when individual observations apply to each variable. To our knowledge, this is the first lifted (linear time) algorithm for filtering with continuous dynamic relational models.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jaesik Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jaesik", "Abner Guzm\u00e1n-Rivera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guzm=aacute=n=Rivera:Abner", "Eyal Amir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amir:Eyal"], "pages": 8}
