However, the psychological notion of intrinsic motivation has recently inspired inquiry into whether there exist alternate reward functions that enable an agent to learn a task more easily than the natural task-based reward function allows. This paper presents an efficient genetic programming algorithm to search for alternate reward functions that improve agent learning performance.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Scott Niekum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niekum:Scott"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
