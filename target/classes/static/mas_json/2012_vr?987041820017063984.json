More specifically, we analyse the capability of Kinects to track infrared points for use in VR applications. Multiple Kinect sensors may serve as a low cost and affordable means to track position information across a large lab space in applications where precise location tracking is not necessary. We present our findings and analysis of the tracking range of a Kinect sensor in situations in which multiple Kinects are present. Overall, the Kinect sensor works well for this application and in lieu of more expensive options, the Kinect sensors may be a viable option for very low-cost tracking in VR applications.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of W\u00fcrzburg", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Srivishnu Satyavolu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satyavolu:Srivishnu", "Gerd Bruder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruder:Gerd", "Pete Willemsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willemsen:Pete", "Frank Steinicke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinicke:Frank"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
