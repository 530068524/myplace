{"title": "Robust plane-based structure from motion.", "fields": ["motion field", "structure from motion", "image plane", "quarter pixel motion", "degeneracy"], "abstract": "We introduce a new approach to structure and motion recovery directly from one or more large planes in the scene. When such a plane exists, we demonstrate how to automatically detect and track it robustly and consistently over a long video sequence, and how to efficiently self-calibrate the camera using the homographies induced by this plane. We build a complete structure from motion system which does not use any additional off-the-plane information about the scene, and show its advantage over conventional systems in handling two important issues which often occur in real world videos, namely, the plane degeneracy and the dynamic foreground problems. Experimental results on a variety of real video sequences verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our system.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Adobe Systems", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zihan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zihan", "Hailin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Hailin", "Yi Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma_0001:Yi"], "pages": 8}
