{"title": "Occlusion boundary detection and figure/ground assignment from optical flow.", "fields": ["optical flow", "optical imaging", "computational model", "figure ground", "occlusion"], "abstract": "In this work, we propose a contour and region detector for video data that exploits motion cues and distinguishes occlusion boundaries from internal boundaries based on optical flow. This detector outperforms the state-of-the-art on the benchmark of Stein and Hebert [24], improving average precision from. 58 to. 72. Moreover, the optical flow on and near occlusion boundaries allows us to assign a depth ordering to the adjacent regions. To evaluate performance on this edge-based figure/ground labeling task, we introduce a new video dataset that we believe will support further research in the field by allowing quantitative comparison of computational models for occlusion boundary detection, depth ordering and segmentation in video sequences.", "citation": "Citations (143)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Freiburg", "California Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Patrik Sundberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundberg:Patrik", "Thomas Brox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brox:Thomas", "Michael Maire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maire:Michael", "Pablo Arbelaez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arbelaez:Pablo", "Jitendra Malik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malik:Jitendra"], "pages": 8}
