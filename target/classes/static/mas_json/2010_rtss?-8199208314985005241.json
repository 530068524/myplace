While the term \u201cblocking\u201d is well-understood in the context of uniprocessor real-time systems, the same is not true in the multiprocessor case. In this paper, two definitions of blocking are presented that are applicable to suspension-based multiprocessor locking protocols. The need for two definitions arises because of differences in how suspensions are handled in existing schedulability analysis. For each definition, locking protocols are presented that have asymptotically optimal blocking behavior. In particular, protocols are presented for any job-level static-priority global or partitioned scheduling algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Bj\u00f6rn B.
