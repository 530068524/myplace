{"title": "A Two-Step Approach for Modelling Flexibility in Software Processes.", "fields": ["systems engineering", "unified modeling language", "software", "metamodeling", "software development process"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a two-step approach for modelling controlled flexibility in software processes: (1) senior process engineers express which, where and how changes can be applied onto process elements, (2) other process participants can easily identify which changes they are allowed to perform, and act accordingly. To support this, we propose a flexibility meta-model and modelling language, and a software process modelling tool called FlexEPFC. Finally, we compare FlexEPFC with three other prominent process-aware tools: SPADE, JIL/Juliette and Jazz.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes and Alto Douro", "Dept. of Inf.
