Applications designed to combine the benefits of both worlds in a mobile paper-digital ensemble require a theoretical understanding of interaction, to inform the design of adequate interaction techniques. To fill this void, we propose a theory based on the results of a stimulus driven exploratory study.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Felix Heinrichs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinrichs:Felix", "Daniel Schreiber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schreiber:Daniel", "Jochen Huber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huber:Jochen", "Max M\u00fchlh\u00e4user.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=hlh=auml=user:Max"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
