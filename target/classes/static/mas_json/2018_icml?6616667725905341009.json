The state-of-the-art aggregation models, however, either provide inconsistent predictions or require time-consuming aggregation process. We first prove the inconsistency of typical aggregations using disjoint or random data partition, and then present a consistent yet efficient aggregation model for large-scale GP. The proposed model inherits the advantages of aggregations, e.g., closed-form inference and aggregation, parallelization and distributed computing. Furthermore, theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that the new aggregation model performs better due to the consistent predictions that converge to the true underlying function when the training size approaches infinity.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rolls-Royce Motor Cars", "Nanyang Technological University", "Rolls-Royce Motor Cars", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Haitao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Haitao", "Jianfei Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Jianfei", "Yi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yi", "Yew-Soon Ong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ong:Yew=Soon"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
