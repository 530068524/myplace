{"title": "PathSync: Multi-User Gestural Interaction with Touchless Rhythmic Path Mimicry.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "mimicry", "rhythm", "multi user", "computer science"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present PathSync, a novel, distal and multi-user mid-air gestural technique based on the principle of rhythmic path mimicry; by replicating the movement of a screen-represented pattern with their hand, users can intuitively interact with digital objects quickly, and with a high level of accuracy. We present three studies that each contribute (1) improvements to how correlation is calculated in path-mimicry techniques necessary for touchless interaction, (2) a validation of its efficiency in comparison to existing techniques, and (3) a demonstration of its intuitiveness and multi-user capacity 'in the wild'. Our studies consequently demonstrate PathSync's potential as an immediately legitimate alternative to existing techniques, with key advantages for public display and multi-user applications.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "Lancaster University", "University of Melbourne", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Marcus Carter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carter:Marcus", "Eduardo Velloso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Velloso:Eduardo", "John Downs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Downs:John", "Abigail Sellen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sellen:Abigail", "Kenton O'Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Hara:Kenton", "Frank Vetere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vetere:Frank"], "pages": 13}
