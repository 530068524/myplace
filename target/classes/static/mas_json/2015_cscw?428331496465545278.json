{"title": "Connected Through Crisis: Emotional Proximity and the Spread of Misinformation Online.", "fields": ["information seeking", "social computing", "misinformation", "information access", "online community"], "abstract": "During crises, the ability to access relevant information is extremely important for those affected. Previous research shows that social media have become popular for rapid information exchange between members of the online community after crisis events. This study focuses on the effects of proximity to a crisis on information sharing behaviors. Using constructivist grounded theory to guide our inquiry, we conducted interviews with eleven people who used social media in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings. Salient themes emerging from this study suggest that both physical and emotional proximity to a crisis influence online information seeking and sharing behaviors. Additionally, speed of information sharing and information access renders social media especially useful during crisis and particularly susceptible to the spread of misinformation. We view the latter as a consequence of the inevitable sensemaking process that occurs as individuals attempt to make sense of incomplete information.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Y.
