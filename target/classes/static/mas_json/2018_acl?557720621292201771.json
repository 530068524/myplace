While prior methods treat the problem as a two-phase task (i.e., detecting hypernymy pairs followed by organizing these pairs into a tree-structured hierarchy), we argue that such two-phase methods may suffer from error propagation, and cannot effectively optimize metrics that capture the holistic structure of a taxonomy. In our approach, the representations of term pairs are learned using multiple sources of information and used to determine \\textit{which} term to select and \\textit{where} to place it on the taxonomy via a policy network. All components are trained in an end-to-end manner with cumulative rewards, measured by a holistic tree metric over the training taxonomies. Experiments on two public datasets of different domains show that our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art taxonomy induction methods up to 19.6\\% on ancestor F1.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei", "Xiang Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Xiang", "Jiaming Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Jiaming", "Yuning Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Yuning", "Xiaotao Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Xiaotao"], "pages": 11}
