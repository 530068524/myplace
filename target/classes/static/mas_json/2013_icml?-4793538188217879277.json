Computerized methods have been shown to be equally or more effective than human clinicians in diagnosing dementia from neuroimages. Nevertheless, much of the work involves the use of domain expertise to extract handcrafted features. The key technique in this paper is the use of cross-domain features to represent MRI data. We used a sparse autoencoder to learn a set of bases from natural images and then applied convolution to extract features from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Using this new representation, we classify MRI instances into three categories: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Healthy Control (HC). Our approach, in spite of being very simple, achieved high classification performance, which is competitive with or better than other approaches.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["University of L ... e, LA 70504 USA", "University of L ... e, LA 70504 USA", "University of L ... e, LA 70504 USA"], "authors": ["Ashish Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Ashish", "Murat Ayhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ayhan:Murat", "Anthony Maida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maida:Anthony"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 8}
