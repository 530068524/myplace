{"title": "A Deep Regression Architecture with Two-Stage Re-initialization for High Performance Facial Landmark Detection.", "fields": ["face detection", "subnetwork", "initialization", "feature", "regression"], "abstract": "Regression based facial landmark detection methods usually learns a series of regression functions to update the landmark positions from an initial estimation. Most of existing approaches focus on learning effective mapping functions with robust image features to improve performance. The approach to dealing with the initialization issue, however, receives relatively fewer attentions. In this paper, we present a deep regression architecture with two-stage re-initialization to explicitly deal with the initialization problem. At the global stage, given an image with a rough face detection result, the full face region is firstly re-initialized by a supervised spatial transformer network to a canonical shape state and then trained to regress a coarse landmark estimation. At the local stage, different face parts are further separately re-initialized to their own canonical shape states, followed by another regression subnetwork to get the final estimation. Our proposed deep architecture is trained from end to end and obtains promising results using different kinds of unstable initialization. It also achieves superior performances over many competing algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Chongqing Inst. ... hongqing, China", "Chongqing Inst. ... hongqing, China", "Inst. of Autom. ...
