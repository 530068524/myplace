Many hardware and OS-based methods have been proposed. However, they may be hardly adopted in practice due to their non-trivial overheads, high complexities, and/or limited abilities to handle increasingly complicated scenarios of cache contention caused by many-cores.   In order to turn cache partitioning methods into reality in the management of multicore processors, we propose to provide an affordable and lightweight hardware support to coordinate with OS-based cache management policies. The proposed methods are scalable to many-cores, and perform comparably with other proposed hardware solutions, but have much lower overheads, therefore can be easily adopted in commodity processors. Having conducted extensive experiments with 37 multi-programming workloads, we show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methods. For example on 8-core systems, one of our proposed policies improves performance over LRU-based hardware cache management by 14.5% on average.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Iowa State University", "Ohio State University"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Jiang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Jiang", "Qingda Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Qingda", "Xiaoning Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Xiaoning", "Zhao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhao", "Xiaodong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Xiaodong", "P.
