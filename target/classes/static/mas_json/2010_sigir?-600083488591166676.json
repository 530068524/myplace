It is argued that the optimal ranking problem should be factorized into two distinct yet interrelated stages: the relevance prediction stage and ranking decision stage. During retrieval the relevance of documents is not known a priori, and the joint probability of relevance is used to measure the uncertainty of documents' relevance in the collection as a whole. The resulting optimization objective function in the latter stage is, thus, the expected value of the IR metric with respect to this probability measure of relevance. Through statistically analyzing the expected values of IR metrics under such uncertainty, we discover and explain some interesting properties of IR metrics that have not been known before. Our analysis and optimization framework do not assume a particular (relevance) retrieval model and metric, making it applicable to many existing IR models and metrics. The experiments on one of resulting applications have demonstrated its significance in adapting to various IR metrics.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["UCL, London, United Kingdom", "UCL, London, United Kingdom"], "authors": ["Jun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0012:Jun", "Jianhan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jianhan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
