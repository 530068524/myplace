{"title": "HiTune: Dataflow-Based Performance Analysis for Big Data Cloud.", "fields": ["dataflow", "dryad", "profiling", "extensibility", "provisioning"], "abstract": "Although Big Data Cloud (e.g., MapReduce, Hadoop and Dryad) makes it easy to develop and run highly scalable applications, efficient provisioning and fine-tuning of these massively distributed systems remain a major challenge. In this paper, we describe a general approach to help address this challenge, based on distributed instrumentations and dataflow-driven performance analysis. Based on this approach, we have implemented HiTune, a scalable, lightweight and extensible performance analyzer for Hadoop. We report our experience on how HiTune helps users to efficiently conduct Hadoop performance analysis and tuning, demonstrating the benefits of dataflow-based analysis and the limitations of existing approaches (e.g., system statistics, Hadoop logs and metrics, and traditional profiling).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Jinquan Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Jinquan", "Jie Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jie", "Shengsheng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Shengsheng", "Bo Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0002:Bo", "Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yan"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
