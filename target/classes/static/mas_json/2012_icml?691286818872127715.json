PI2 is a recent example of this approach. It combines a derivation from first principles of stochastic optimal control with tools from statistical estimation theory. In this paper, we consider PI2 as a member of the wider family of methods which share the concept of probability-weighted averaging to iteratively update parameters to optimize a cost function. We compare PI2 to other members of the same family - Cross-Entropy Methods and CMAES - at the conceptual level and in terms of performance. The comparison suggests the derivation of a novel algorithm which we call PI2-CMA for \"Path Integral Policy Improvement with Covariance Matrix Adaptation\". PI2-CMA's main advantage is that it determines the magnitude of the exploration noise automatically.", "citation": "Citations (119)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Superior National School of Advanced Techniques", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Freek Stulp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stulp:Freek", "Olivier Sigaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sigaud:Olivier"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
