This limitation might influence how we perceive and react to our surroundings, however, this limitation might endanger us in certain scenarios e.g. firefighting. In this paper, we explore the potential of augmenting the visual sensing of the firefighters using depth and thermal imaging to increase their awareness about the environment. Additionally, we built and evaluated two form factors, hand held and head mounted display. To evaluate our built prototypes, we conducted two user studies in a simulated fire environment with real firefighters. In this workshop paper, we present our findings from the evaluation of the concept and prototypes with real firefighters.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "authors": ["Yomna Abdelrahman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdelrahman:Yomna", "Pascal Knierim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knierim:Pascal", "Pawel W.
