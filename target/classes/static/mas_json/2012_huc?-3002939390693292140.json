These machine learning based methods are designed for the general case of a person holding a mobile device in an unknown location and require only a single low-cost, low-power sensor: a triaxial accelerometer. We evaluate our methods in straight-path indoor walking experiments as well as in natural indoor walking settings. Experiments with 14 human participants to test user generalization show that our pose classifier correctly selects among four device poses with 94% accuracy compared to 82% for previous work, and our walking speed estimates are within 12-15% (straight/indoor walk) of ground truth compared to 17-22% for previous work. Implementation on a mobile phone demonstrates that both methods can run efficiently online.", "citation": "Citations (101)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Nokia"], "authors": ["Jun-geun Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jun=geun", "Ami Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Ami", "Dorothy Curtis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curtis:Dorothy", "Seth J.
