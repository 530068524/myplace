{"title": "UI driven Android application reduction.", "fields": ["android", "instruction cycle", "humanoid robot", "mobile telephony", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "While smartphone\u00ab and mobile apps have been an integral part of our life, modern mobile apps tend to contain a lot of rarely used functionalities. For example, applications contain advertisements and offer extra features such as recommended news stories in weather apps. While these functionalities are not essential to an app, they nonetheless consume power, CPU cycles and bandwidth. In this paper, we design a UI driven approach that allows customizing an Android app by removing its unwanted functionalities. In particular, our technique displays the UI and allows the user to select elements denoting functionalities that she wants to remove. Using this information, our technique automatically removes all the code elements related to the selected functionalities, including all the relevant background tasks. The underlying analysis is a type system, in which each code element is tagged with a type indicating if it should be removed. From the UI hints, our technique infers types for all other code elements and reduces the app accordingly. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on 10 real-world Android apps. The results show that our approach can accurately discover the removable code elements and lead to substantial resource savings in the reduced apps.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Huawei"], "authors": ["Jianjun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jianjun", "Yousra Aafer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aafer:Yousra", "David Mitchel Perry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perry:David_Mitchel", "Xiangyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Xiangyu", "Chen Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Chen"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
