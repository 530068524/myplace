Static ACC focuses on the module views of architecture and especially on rules constraining the modular elements. This paper presents HUSACCT, a static ACC tool that adds extensive support for semantically rich modular architectures (SRMAs) to the current practice of static ACC tools. An SRMA contains modules of semantically different types, like layers and components, which are constrained by rules of different types. HUSACCT provides support for five commonly used types of modules and eleven types of rules. We describe and illustrate how basic and extensive support of these types is provided and how the support can be configured. In addition, we discuss the internal architecture of the tool.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht", "HAN University of Applied Sciences", "University Utre ... ht, Netherlands", "University Utre ... ht, Netherlands"], "authors": ["Leo J.
