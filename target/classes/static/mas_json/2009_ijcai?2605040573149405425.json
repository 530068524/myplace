We show empirically that it can consistently select an appropriate abstraction using very little sample data, and that it significantly improves skill learning performance in a reasonably large real-valued reinforcement learning domain.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["George Konidaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konidaris:George", "Andrew G.
