We use a combination of static and a dynamic analyses of a single representative run of the program to build its model. The model can predict performance of the program under a variety of configurations. This paper outlines how we construct the model and demonstrates how the resultant models accurately predict the performance %and resource utilization of complex multithreaded programs.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University"], "authors": ["Alexander Tarvo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarvo:Alexander", "Steven P.
