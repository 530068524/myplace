Physical-Layer Network Coding was first introduced as a solution to increase the throughput of a two-way relay channel communication. Unlike most wireless communications techniques which try to avoid collisions, PLNC allows two simultaneous transmissions to a common receiver. Such transmitted messages are summed at signal level and then decoded at packet level. In basic topologies, Physical-Layer Network Coding has been shown to significantly enhance the throughput performance compared to classical communications. However, the impact of PLNC in large multi-hop networks remains an open question. We therefore exploit Linear Programming to evaluate the impact of this paradigm in large realistic radio deployments. Our numerical results show that PLNC can increase the throughput in large multi-hop topologies by 30%. Such gains set theoretical benchmarks for designing new access methods and routing protocols to efficiently exploit the Physical-Layer Network Coding concept.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Thales Communications", "Thales Communications", "University of Toulouse", "Thales Communications", "University of Toulouse"], "conf": "infocom", "authors": ["Raphael Naves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naves:Raphael", "Hicham Khalife.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khalife:Hicham", "Gentian Jakllari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jakllari:Gentian", "Vania Conan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conan:Vania", "Andr\u00e9-Luc Beylot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beylot:Andr=eacute==Luc"], "pages": 9}
