The collision attack is the first below the birthday bound to be described for MDC-2 and, with  n  = 128, it has complexity 2124.5, which is to be compared to the birthday attack having complexity 2128. The preimage attacks constitute new time/memory trade-offs; the most efficient attack requires time and space about 2  n  , which is to be compared to the previous best known preimage attack of Lai and Massey (Eurocrypt '92), having time complexity 23 n  /2 and space complexity 2  n  /2, and to a brute force preimage attack having complexity 22 n  .", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Technical University of Denmark", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Technical University of Denmark"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Lars R.
