{"title": "The Wi-Fi privacy ticker: improving awareness & control of personal information exposure on Wi-Fi.", "fields": ["personally identifiable information", "internet privacy", "wireless network", "web traffic", "software"], "abstract": "Anyone within range of an 802.11 wireless network (\"Wi-Fi\") can use free software to collect the unencrypted web traffic of others on the network. However, many Wi-Fi users are completely unaware of the risk that this creates. This work aims to improve users' awareness about what they expose to others on Wi-Fi networks and provide them with some control. Our system, the  Wi-Fi Privacy Ticker , displays information about the exposure of sensitive terms that are sent to and from a user's computer and prevents the unencrypted transmission of terms from the user's computer that she has identified as highly sensitive. In a three-week field study with 17 participants, we found that the Wi-Fi Privacy Ticker improved participants' awareness of the circumstances in which their personal information is transmitted. We show that this heightened awareness contributed to changes in their behavior while on Wi-Fi.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Sunny Consolvo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Consolvo:Sunny", "Jaeyeon Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Jaeyeon", "Ben Greenstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenstein:Ben", "Pauline Powledge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Powledge:Pauline", "Gabriel Maganis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maganis:Gabriel", "Daniel Avrahami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avrahami:Daniel"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
