This paper introduces a hierarchical Bayesian formulation applicable to count time series that can easily account for explanatory variables and share statistical strength across groups of related time series. We derive an efficient approximate inference technique, and illustrate its performance on a number of datasets from supply chain planning.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["ApSTAT Technolo ...
