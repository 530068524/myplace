In this paper we propose a new encoding from Maxclique into MaxSAT and use MaxSAT technology to improve the upper bound based on the partition P. In this way, the strength of specific algorithms for Max-clique in partitioning a graph and the strength of MaxSAT technology in propositional reasoning are naturally combined to solve Maxclique. Experimental results show that the approach is very effective on hard random graphs and on DI-MACS Maxclique benchmarks, and allows to close an open DIMACS problem.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "University of Picardie Jules Verne"], "authors": ["Chu Min Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chu_Min", "Zhe Quan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quan:Zhe"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
