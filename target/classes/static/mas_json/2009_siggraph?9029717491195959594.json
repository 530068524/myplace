Finally the \"Unbelievable 4\" get the call. A superhero team (composed of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and Donald Rumsfeld) receives the urgent message that the earth is under attack and they have five minutes to launch a rocket for a preemptive strike. Over the course of the story, the caricaturized leaders' over-heroic personalities slowly merge with the personalities of rock stars.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": [], "conf": "siggraph", "authors": ["Sukwon Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Sukwon"], "pages": 1}
