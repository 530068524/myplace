Our model generalizes an existing one for this problem by allowing roads with a broad class of stochastic delay models. We then present a fast algorithm based on the sample average approximation (SAA) method and network design techniques to solve this problem approximately. On a small existing benchmark, our algorithm produces near-optimal solutions and the SAA method converges quickly with a small number of samples. We then apply our algorithm to a large real-world problem to optimize the resilience of a road network to failures of stream crossing structures to minimize travel times of emergency medical service vehicles. On medium-sized networks, our algorithm obtains solutions of comparable quality to a greedy baseline method but is 30-60 times faster. Our algorithm is the only existing algorithm that can scale to the full network, which has many thousands of edges.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["XiaoJian Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:XiaoJian", "Daniel Sheldon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheldon:Daniel", "Shlomo Zilberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zilberstein:Shlomo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
