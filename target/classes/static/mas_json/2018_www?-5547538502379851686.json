{"title": "ROSC: Robust Spectral Clustering on Multi-scale Data.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "spectral clustering", "spectral method", "matrix", "reachability"], "abstract": "We investigate the effectiveness of spectral methods in clustering multi-scale data, which is data whose clusters are of various sizes and densities. We review existing spectral methods that are designed to handle multi-scale data and propose an alternative approach that is orthogonal to existing methods. We put forward the algorithm ROSC, which computes an affinity matrix that takes into account both objects\u2019 feature similarity and reachability similarity. We perform extensive experiments comparing ROSC against 9 other methods on both real and synthetic datasets. Our results show that ROSC performs very well against the competitors. In particular, it is very robust in that it consistently performs well over all the datasets tested. Also, it outperforms others by wide margins for datasets that are highly multi-scale.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Xiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiang", "Ben Kao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kao:Ben", "Siqiang Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Siqiang", "Martin Ester.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ester:Martin"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
