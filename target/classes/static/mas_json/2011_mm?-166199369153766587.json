DASH is an emerging ISO/IEC MPEG and 3GPP standard for HTTP streaming. It aims to standardize formats enabling segmented progressive download by exploiting existing Internet infrastructure as such. Our implementation of these formats as described in this paper is based on the well-known VLC. Hence, it is fully integrated into the VLC structure and has been also submitted to the VLC development team for consideration in future releases of VLC. Therefore, it is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The plugin provides a very flexible structure that could be easily extended with respect to different adaptation logics or profiles of the DASH standard. As a consequence, the plugin enables the integration of a variety of adaptation logics and comparison thereof, making it attractive for the research community.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "departments": ["Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt", "Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt"], "authors": ["Christopher M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Christopher", "Christian Timmerer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Timmerer:Christian"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
