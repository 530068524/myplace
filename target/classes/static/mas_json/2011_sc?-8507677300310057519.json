Even current machines are found to be I/O bound for some applications. In this paper, we identify existing performance bottlenecks in data movement for I/O on the IBM Blue Gene/P (BG/P) supercomputer currently deployed at several leadership computing facilities. We improve the I/O performance by exploiting the network topology of BG/P for collective I/O, leveraging data semantics of applications and incorporating asynchronous data staging. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches for synthetic benchmark experiments and for application-level benchmarks at scale on leadership computing systems.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Venkatram Vishwanath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vishwanath:Venkatram", "Mark Hereld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hereld:Mark", "Vitali A.
