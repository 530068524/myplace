{"title": "ACT-AP: ACTivator access point for multicast over WLAN.", "fields": ["distance vector multicast routing protocol", "xcast", "ip multicast", "reliable multicast", "pragmatic general multicast"], "abstract": "Multicast is a major solution in supporting the explosive growth of the wireless video traffic demand. Also, power saving is a key technology to extend battery life of mobile devices. To meet both purposes, IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN) supports power save mode (PSM) for station (STA) while receiving multicast packets. According to recent studies, off-the-shelf chipsets configured to use PSM show un-desired functions, thus resulting in many multicast packet losses. From our extensive measurement, we also verify degradation of multicast performance with widely-used off-the-shelf chipsets using PSM, and present previously-unknown undesired functions. Without modification of the chipsets, STA in PSM cannot enjoy reliable multicast service. Given this, we develop a practical and readily-applicable AP-side solution, called ACT-AP, which avoids multicast packet losses by preventing STA from operating in PSM. Our prototype implementation with off-the-shelf chipsets demonstrates that ACT-AP improves packet delivery ratio by up to 216% with little additional protocol overhead. To our best knowledge, ACT-AP is the first practical effort to support multicast to real devices with undesired functions in PSM.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Gyujin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Gyujin", "Yeonchul Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Yeonchul", "Jonghoe Koo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koo:Jonghoe", "Junyoung Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Junyoung", "Sunghyun Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Sunghyun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
