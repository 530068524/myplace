{"title": "Symbolic Model Checking for One-Resource RB+-ATL.", "fields": ["theoretical computer science", "symbolic trajectory evaluation", "state space", "model checking", "decidability"], "abstract": "RB\u00b1ATL is an extension of ATL where it is possible to model consumption and production of several resources by a set of agents. The model-checking problem for RB\u00b1ATL is known to be decidable. However the only available model-checking algorithm for RB\u00b1ATL uses a forward search of the state space, and hence does not have an efficient symbolic implementation. In this paper, we consider a fragment of RB\u00b1ATL, 1RB\u00b1ATL, that allows only one resource type. We give a symbolic model-checking algorithm for this fragment of RB\u00b1ATL, and evaluate the performance of an MCMAS-based implementation of the algorithm on an example problem that can be scaled to large state spaces.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "Middlesex University"], "authors": ["Natasha Alechina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alechina:Natasha", "Brian Logan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Logan:Brian", "Hoang Nga Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hoang_Nga", "Franco Raimondi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raimondi:Franco"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
