The history of eco-feedback extends back more than 40 years to the origins of environmental psychology. Despite its stated purpose, few HCI eco-feedback studies have attempted to measure behavior change. This leads to two overarching questions: (1) what can HCI learn from environmental psychology and (2) what role should HCI have in designing and evaluating eco-feedback technology? To help answer these questions, this paper conducts a comparative survey of eco-feedback technology, including 89 papers from environmental psychology and 44 papers from the HCI and UbiComp literature. We also provide an overview of predominant models of proenvironmental behaviors and a summary of key motivation techniques to promote this behavior.", "citation": "Citations (722)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Jon Froehlich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Froehlich:Jon", "Leah Findlater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Findlater:Leah", "James A.
