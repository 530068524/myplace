{"title": "Visual Pool: A Tool to Visualize and Interact with the Pooling Method.", "fields": ["data mining", "pooling", "information retrieval", "computer science", "visualization"], "abstract": "Every year more than 25 test collections are built among the main Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation campaigns. They are extremely important in IR because they become the evaluation praxis for the forthcoming years. Test collections are built mostly using the pooling method. The main advantage of this method is that it drastically reduces the number of documents to be judged. It does so at the cost of introducing biases, which are sometimes aggravated by non optimal configuration. In this paper we develop a novel visualization technique for the pooling method, and integrate it in a demo application named  Visual Pool . This demo application enables the user to interact with the pooling method with ease, and develops visual hints in order to analyze existing test collections, and build better ones.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Aldo Lipani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lipani:Aldo", "Mihai Lupu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lupu:Mihai", "Allan Hanbury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanbury:Allan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
