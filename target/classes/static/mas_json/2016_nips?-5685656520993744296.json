Our main contribution is twofold: first, we present a rigorous graph-theoretic framework describing the connecting architectures of RNNs in general. Second, we propose three architecture complexity measures of RNNs: (a) the recurrent depth, which captures the RNN's over-time nonlinear complexity, (b) the feedforward depth, which captures the local input-output non-linearity (similar to the \"depth\" in feedforward neural networks (FNNs)), and (c) the recurrent skip coefficient which captures how rapidly the information propagates over time. We rigorously prove each measure's existence and computability. Our experimental results show that RNNs might benefit from larger recurrent depth and feedforward depth. We further demonstrate that increasing recurrent skip coefficient offers performance boosts on long term dependency problems.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "University of Toronto", "Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Saizheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Saizheng", "Yuhuai Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yuhuai", "Tong Che.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Che:Tong", "Zhouhan Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhouhan", "Roland Memisevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Memisevic:Roland", "Ruslan Salakhutdinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salakhutdinov:Ruslan", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
