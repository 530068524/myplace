{"title": "Selective Versioning in a Secure Disk System.", "fields": ["exploit", "versioning file system", "executable", "linux kernel", "software versioning"], "abstract": "Making vital disk data recoverable even in the event of OS compromises has become a necessity, in view of the increased prevalence of OS vulnerability exploits over the recent years. We present the design and implementation of a secure disk system, SVSDS, that performs selective, flexible, and transparent versioning of stored data, at the disk-level. In addition to versioning, SVSDS actively enforces constraints to protect executables and system log files. Most existing versioning solutions that operate at the disk-level are unaware of the higher-level abstractions of data, and hence are not customizable. We evolve a hybrid solution that combines the advantages of disk-level and file-system--level versioning systems thereby ensuring security, while at the same time allowing flexible policies. We implemented and evaluated a software-level prototype of SVSDS in the Linux kernel and it shows that the space and performance overheads associated with selective versioning at the disk level are minimal.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Swaminathan Sundararaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundararaman:Swaminathan", "Gopalan Sivathanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sivathanu:Gopalan", "Erez Zadok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zadok:Erez"], "pages": 16}
