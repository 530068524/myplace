An effective automatic annotation system for personal albums is desired for both efficient browsing and search. Existing research on image annotation evolves through two stages: learning-based methods and web-based methods. Learning-based methods attempt to learn classifiers or joint probabilities between images and concepts, which are difficult to handle large-scale concept sets due to the lack of training data. Web-based methods leverage web image data to learn relevant annotations, which greatly expand the scale of concepts. However, they still suffer two problems: the query image lacks prior knowledge and the annotations are often noisy and incoherent. To address the above issues, we propose a web-based annotation approach to annotate a collection of photos simultaneously, instead of annotating them independently, by leveraging the abundant correlations among the photos. A multi-graph similarity propagation based semi-supervised learning (MGSP-SSL) algorithm is proposed to suppress the noises in the initial annotations from the Web. Experiments on real personal albums show that the proposed approach outperforms existing annotation methods.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jimin Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jimin", "Nenghai Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Nenghai", "Xian-Sheng Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Xian=Sheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
