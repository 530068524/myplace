The learning examples for this task are time series for which the true alignment is known. We cast the alignment problem as a structured prediction task, and propose realistic losses between alignments for which the optimization is tractable. We provide experiments on real data in the audio-to-audio context, where we show that the learning of a similarity measure leads to improvements in the performance of the alignment task. We also propose to use this metric learning framework to perform feature selection and, from basic audio features, build a combination of these with better alignment performance.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["R\u00e9mi Lajugie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lajugie:R=eacute=mi", "Damien Garreau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garreau:Damien", "Francis R.
