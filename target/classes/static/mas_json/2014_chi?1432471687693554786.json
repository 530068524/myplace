{"title": "End-users publishing structured information on the web: an observational study of what, why, and how.", "fields": ["web development", "web modeling", "web standards", "web design", "web mapping"], "abstract": "End-users are accustomed to filtering and browsing styled collections of data on professional web sites, but they have few ways to create and publish such information architectures for themselves. This paper presents a full-lifecycle analysis of the Exhibit framework - an end-user tool which provides such functionality - to understand the needs, capabilities, and practices of this class of users. We include interviews, as well as analysis of over 1,800 visualizations and 200,000 web interactions with these visualizations. Our analysis reveals important findings about this user population which generalize to the task of providing better end-user structured content publication tools.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Edward Benson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benson:Edward", "David R.
