{"title": "Discriminative Unsupervised Dimensionality Reduction.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "diffusion map", "graph embedding", "dimensionality reduction", "block matrix"], "abstract": "As an important machine learning topic, dimensionality reduction has been widely studied and utilized in various kinds of areas. A multitude of dimensionality reduction methods have been developed, among which unsupervised dimensionality reduction is more desirable when obtaining label information requires onerous work. However, most previous unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods call for an affinity graph constructed beforehand, with which the following dimensionality reduction steps can be then performed. Separation of graph construction and dimensionality reduction leads the dimensionality reduction process highly dependent on quality of the input graph. In this paper, we propose a novel graph embedding method for unsupervised dimensionality reduction. We simultaneously conduct dimensionality reduction along with graph construction by assigning adaptive and optimal neighbors according to the projected local distances. Our method doesn't need an affinity graph constructed in advance, but instead learns the graph concurrently with dimensionality reduction. Thus, the learned graph is optimal for dimensionality reduction. Meanwhile, our learned graph has an explicit block diagonal structure, from which the clustering results could be directly revealed without any postprocessing steps. Extensive empirical results on dimensionality reduction as well as clustering are presented to corroborate the performance of our method.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "authors": ["Xiaoqian Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaoqian", "Yun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yun", "Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Heng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Heng"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
