{"title": "Recommendation Diversification Using Explanations.", "fields": ["recommender system", "result set", "diversification", "cultural diversity", "limiting"], "abstract": "We introduce the novel notion of {\\em explanation-based diversification} to address the well-known problem of {\\em over-specialization} in item recommendations. Over-specialization in recommender systems leads to result sets with items that are too similar to one another, thus reducing the diversity of results and limiting user choices. Traditionally, the problem is addressed through {\\em attribute-based diversification}|grouping items in the result set that share many common attributes (e.g., genre for movies) and selecting only a limited number of items from each group. It is, however, not always applicable, especially for social content recommendations. For example, attributes may not be available as in the case of recommending URLs for users of del.icio.us. Explanation-based diversification provides a novel and complementary alternative|it leverages the {\\em reason for which a particular item is being recommended} (i.e., explanation)|for diversifying the results, without the need to access the attributes of the items. In this paper, we formally define the problem of {\\em explanation-based diversification} and, without going into the details of the actual diversification process, demonstrate its effectiveness on a real world data set, Yahoo!~Movies.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "University of British Columbia", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Cong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Cong", "Laks V.
