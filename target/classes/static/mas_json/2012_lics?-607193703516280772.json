For first-order logic on finite structures, it is PSPACE-complete, and the natural evaluation algorithm exhibits exponential dependence on the formula. We study model checking on the quantified conjunctive fragment of first-order logic, namely, prenex sentences having a purely conjunctive quantifier-free part. Following a number of works, we associate a graph to the quantifier-free part; each sentence then induces a prefixed graph, a quantifier prefix paired with a graph on its variables. We give a comprehensive classification of the sets of prefixed graphs on which model checking is tractable, based on a novel generalization of treewidth, that generalizes and places into a unified framework a number of existing results.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dept. de Tecnol ... arcelona, Spain", "Dept. de Tecnol ... arcelona, Spain"], "authors": ["Hubie Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hubie", "V\u00edctor Dalmau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dalmau:V=iacute=ctor"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
