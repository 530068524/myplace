In particular, role play is used to involve different stakeholders into the use case analysis. To support this kind of co-located collaboration we developed CREW-Space, which allows several users to simultaneously interact through Android-enabled mobile devices with the same model displayed on a shared screen. Furthermore, it keeps track of the current state of the role play and, in addition, each mobile device serves as a private workspace; it actually turns into a tangible digital CRC card.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Trier", "University of Trier", "University of Trier"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Rainer Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutz:Rainer", "Sascha Sch\u00e4fer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=auml=fer_0001:Sascha", "Stephan Diehl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diehl_0001:Stephan"], "pages": 4}
