In this paper, we aim to discover anomalous driving patterns from taxi's GPS traces, targeting applications like automatically detecting taxi driving frauds or road network change in modern cites. To achieve the objective, firstly we group all the taxi trajectories crossing the same source destination cell-pair and represent each taxi trajectory as a sequence of symbols. Secondly, we propose an Isolation-Based Anomalous Trajectory (iBAT) detection method and verify with large scale taxi data that iBAT achieves remarkable performance (AUC>0.99, over 90% detection rate at false alarm rate of less than 2%). Finally, we demonstrate the potential of iBAT in enabling innovative applications by using it for taxi driving fraud detection and road network change detection.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "departments": ["Telecom SudParis", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Telecom SudParis", "Telecom SudParis"], "authors": ["Daqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Daqing", "Nan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Nan", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua", "Chao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0004:Chao", "Lin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Lin", "Shijian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shijian"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
