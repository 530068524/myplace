Rather than using graph-mining and dimensionality-reduction techniques, SenticNet 3 makes use of 'energy flows' to connect various parts of extended common and common-sense knowledge representations to one another. SenticNet 3 models nuanced semantics and sentics (that is, the conceptual and affective information associated with multi-word natural language expressions), representing information with a symbolic opacity of an intermediate nature between that of neural networks and typical symbolic systems.", "citation": "Citations (250)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Erik Cambria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cambria:Erik", "Daniel Olsher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olsher:Daniel", "Dheeraj Rajagopal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajagopal:Dheeraj"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
