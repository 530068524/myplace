{"title": "AGA: Attribute-Guided Augmentation.", "fields": ["architecture", "training set", "data modeling", "annotation", "feature vector"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of data augmentation, i.e., generating artificial samples to extend a given corpus of training data. Specifically, we propose attributed-guided augmentation (AGA) which learns a mapping that allows to synthesize data such that an attribute of a synthesized sample is at a desired value or strength. This is particularly interesting in situations where little data with no attribute annotation is available for learning, but we have access to a large external corpus of heavily annotated samples. While prior works primarily augment in the space of images, we propose to perform augmentation in feature space instead. We implement our approach as a deep encoder-decoder architecture that learns the synthesis function in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the problems of (1) one-shot object recognition in a transfer-learning setting where we have no prior knowledge of the new classes, as well as (2) object-based one-shot scene recognition. As external data, we leverage 3D depth and pose information from the SUN RGB-D dataset. Our experiments show that attribute-guided augmentation of high-level CNN features considerably improves one-shot recognition performance on both problems.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of Salzburg", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mandar Dixit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dixit:Mandar", "Roland Kwitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwitt:Roland", "Marc Niethammer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niethammer:Marc", "Nuno Vasconcelos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasconcelos:Nuno"], "pages": 9}
