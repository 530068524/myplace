Finding suitable replacements for framework elements that were accessed by a client program and deleted as part of the framework's evolution can be a challenging task. We present a recommendation system, SemDiff, that suggests adaptations to client programs by analyzing how a framework adapts to its own changes. In a study of the evolution of the Eclipse JDT framework and three client programs, our approach recommended relevant adaptive changes with a high level of precision, and detected non-trivial changes typically undiscovered by current refactoring detection techniques.", "citation": "Citations (195)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University", "McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Dagenais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dagenais:Barth=eacute=l=eacute=my", "Martin P.
