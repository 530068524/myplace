Aronson, Dyer, Frieze and Suen studied the modified randomized greedy (MRG) algorithm and proved that it approximates the maximum matching within a factor of at least 1/2 + 1/400,000. They use heavy combinatorial methods in their analysis. We introduce a new technique we call Contrast Analysis, and show a 1/2 + 1/256 performance lower bound for the MRG algorithm. The technique seems to be useful not only for the MRG, but also for other related algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Goethe University Frankfurt", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Matthias Poloczek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poloczek:Matthias", "Mario Szegedy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szegedy:Mario"], "pages": 10}
