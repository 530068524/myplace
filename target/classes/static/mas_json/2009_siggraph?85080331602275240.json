While identification is considered important to the organization, it has not been clearly operationalized. The current study tests a proposed model of organizational identification. Self-report data from 297 alumni of an all-male religious college indicate that identification with the alma mater was associated with: (1) the hypothesized organizational antecedents of organizational distinctiveness, organizational prestige, and (absence of) intraorganizational competition, but not with interorganizational competition, (2) the hypothesized individual antecedents of satisfaction with the organization, tenure as students, and sentimentality, but not with recency of attendance, number of schools attended, or the existence of a mentor, and (3) the hypothesized outcomes of making financial contributions, willingness to advise one's offspring and others to attend the college, and participating in various school functions. The findings provide direction for academic administrators seeking to increase alumni support, as well as for corporate managers concerned about the loyalty of workers in an era of mergers and takeovers.", "citation": "Citations (4,891)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Concordia University", "Medical Research Council", "Save the Children", "BRAC University", "London School of Economics and Political Science", "All India Institute of Medical Sciences", "Aga Khan University", "Aga Khan University", "Aga Khan University", "Aga Khan University", "National Radio Astronomy Observatory", "National Radio Astronomy Observatory", "National Radio Astronomy Observatory", "European Southern Observatory", "National Radio Astronomy Observatory", "BRAC University", "University of London", "Medical Research Council", "Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Health", "Johns Hopkins University", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "University of Leeds", "Save the Children", "Save the Children", "Medical Research Council", "Dartmouth College", "U.S. Army Resea ... a, U.S.A. 22333", "National AIDS C ...
