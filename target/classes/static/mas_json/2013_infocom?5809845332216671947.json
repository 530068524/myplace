Before the paper, the only known explicit MBCR codes are given with parameters n = d + r and d = k, while our construction applies to all possible values of n, k, d, r. The code has a brief expression in the polynomial form and the data reconstruction is accomplished by bivariate polynomial interpolation. It is a scalar code and operates over a finite field of size q \u2265 n. Besides, we establish several subspace properties for linear exact MBCR codes. Based on these properties we prove that linear exact MBCR codes cannot achieve repair-by-transfer.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Key Lab. of Mat ...
