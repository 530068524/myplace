We explored the influence of varying conditions of eye-representation in our high-fidelity avatar by measuring how accurately people can identify the avatar's point-of- regard (direction of gaze), together with subjective authenticity assessments of the avatar's behaviour and visual representation. The first of two variables investigated was  socket-deformation , which is to say that our avatar's eyelids, eyebrows and surrounding areas morphed realistically depending on eye-rotation. The second was  vergence  of our avatar's eyes to the exact point-of-regard. Our results suggest that the two variables significantly influence the accuracy of point-of-regard identification. This accuracy is highly dependent on the combination of viewing-angle and the point-of-regard itself. We found that socket-deformation in particular has a highly positive impact on the perceived authenticity of our avatar's overall appearance, and when judging just the eyes. However, despite favourable subjective ratings, overall performance during the point-of-regard identification task was actually worse with the highest quality avatar. This provides more evidence that as we move forward to using higher fidelity avatars, there will be a tradeoff between supporting realism of representation and supporting the actual communicative task.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["William Steptoe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steptoe:William", "Anthony Steed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steed:Anthony"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
