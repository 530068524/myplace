Despite its importance, still much remains to be determined regarding how faults disseminate or at what rate do they impact HPC applications. The understanding of where and how fast faults propagate could lead to more efficient implementation of application-driven error detection and recovery. In this work, we propose a fault propagation framework to analyze how faults propagate in MPI applications and to understand their vulnerability to faults. We employ a combination of compiler-level code transformation and instrumentation, along with a runtime checker. Using the information provided by our framework, we employ machine learning technique to derive application fault propagation models that can be used to estimate the number of corrupted memory locations at runtime.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "University of Central Florida", "IBM"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Rizwan A.
