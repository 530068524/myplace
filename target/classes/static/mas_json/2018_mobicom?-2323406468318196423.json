{"title": "Surface MIMO: Using Conductive Surfaces For MIMO Between Small Devices.", "fields": ["spatial multiplexing", "wideband", "throughput", "mimo", "electrical conductor"], "abstract": "As connected devices continue to decrease in size, we explore the idea of leveraging everyday surfaces such as tabletops and walls to augment the wireless capabilities of devices. Specifically, we introduce Surface MIMO, a technique that enables MIMO communication between small devices via surfaces coated with conductive paint or covered with conductive cloth. These surfaces act as an additional spatial path that enables MIMO capabilities without increasing the physical size of the devices themselves. We provide an extensive characterization of these surfaces that reveal their effect on the propagation of EM waves. Our evaluation shows that we can enable additional spatial streams using the conductive surface and achieve average throughput gains of 2.6-3x for small devices. Finally, we also leverage the wideband characteristics of these conductive surfaces to demonstrate the first Gbps surface communication system that can directly transfer bits through the surface at up to 1.3 Gbps.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "mobicom", "authors": ["Justin Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Justin", "Anran Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Anran", "Vikram Iyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iyer:Vikram", "Shyamnath Gollakota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollakota:Shyamnath"], "pages": 16}
