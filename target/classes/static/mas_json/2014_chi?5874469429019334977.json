{"title": "Now you see me, now you don't: protecting smartphone authentication from shoulder surfers.", "fields": ["chip authentication program", "authentication", "password", "shoulder surfing", "usability"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present XSide, an authentication mechanism that uses the front and the back of smartphones to enter stroke-based passwords. Users can switch sides during input to minimize the risk of shoulder surfing. We performed a user study (n = 32) to explore how switching sides during authentication affects usability and security of the system. The results indicate that switching the sides increases security while authentication speed stays relatively fast (\u2264 4 seconds). The paper furthermore provides insights on accuracy of eyes-free input (as used in XSide) and shows how 3D printed prototype cases can improve the back-of-device interaction experience.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Leibniz Univers ... nnover, Germany"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alexander De Luca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luca:Alexander_De", "Marian Harbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harbach:Marian", "Emanuel von Zezschwitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zezschwitz:Emanuel_von", "Max-Emanuel Maurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maurer:Max=Emanuel", "Bernhard Ewald Slawik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slawik:Bernhard_Ewald", "Heinrich Hussmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hussmann:Heinrich", "Matthew Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith_0001:Matthew"], "pages": 10}
