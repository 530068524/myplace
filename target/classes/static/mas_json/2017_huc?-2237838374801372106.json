{"title": "A scalable manufacturing method for garment-integrated technologies.", "fields": ["process development execution system", "advanced manufacturing", "e textiles", "wearable technology", "integrated computer aided manufacturing"], "abstract": "Reliable, durable, and scalable fabrication of garment-integrated electronics are the major barriers to larger-scale garment integrated applications for wearable technology. This research emphasizes developing hybrid manufacturing processes leveraging the benefits of the traditional labor-intensive apparel industry and the automated electronics industry. The proposed manufacturing process uses the existing technology, resources, and operation sequence of a typical apparel manufacturing facility. A simulation approach is utilized to increase the overall efficiency of the manufacturing method.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Md.
