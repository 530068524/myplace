More precisely, based on some highly non-trivial work by Krajicek, we show that for each prime p there exists a function l(n) G isin Omega(log(n)) for NS and l(n) G Omega (log(log(n)) for PC, such that the prepositional translation of any FO formula (that fails in all finite models), has degree proof complexity over fields of characteristic p, that behave in 4 mutually distinct ways: (i) The degree complexity is bound by a constant. (ii) The degree complexity is at least l(n) for all values of n. (iii) The degree complexity is at least l(n) except in a finite number of regular subsequences of infinite size, where the degree is constant. (iv) The degree complexity fluctuates in a very particular way with the degree complexity taking different constant values on an infinite number of regular subsequences each of infinite size. We leave it as an open question whether the classification remains valid for l[n) isin n Omega (1) or even for I (n) isin Omega(n). Finally, we show that for any non-empty proper subset A sube {(i), (ii), (iii), (iv)} the decision problem of whether a given input FO formula Psi has type belonging to A - is undecidable.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of London"], "authors": ["S\u00f8ren Riis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riis:S=oslash=ren"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
