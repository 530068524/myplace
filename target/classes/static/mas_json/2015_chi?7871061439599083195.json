{"title": "D-Coil: A Hands-on Approach to Digital 3D Models Design.", "fields": ["electromagnetic coil", "3d modeling", "3d printing", "extrusion", "wax"], "abstract": "We introduce D-Coil, a new digital 3D modeling approach using wax coiling to bring tangibility to the design of digital models. After defining a shape to extrude, the users follow the lead of a hand-held actuated extruder to instantiate the actual extrusion using wax. The tangibility of the wax extrusion sets the stage to create the next components until the digital model is completed. The digital model affords all digital attributes (ease of transformation, distribution, and 3D printing) while the wax artifact can be discarded or kept as a one-of-a-kind memento. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of D-Coil and showcase how this additive approach can also be extended to a subtractive process using a digitally actuated cutter. By adding a 6DOF mouse, users can also include scaling, rotation, and bending effects to create a wide variety of shapes often difficult for novices to produce in standard CAD software.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Huaishu Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Huaishu", "Amit Zoran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zoran:Amit", "Fran\u00e7ois Guimbreti\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guimbreti=egrave=re:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 9}
