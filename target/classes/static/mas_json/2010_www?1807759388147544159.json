Given its role in service provisioning, it is very important to assess the performance of middleware in the context of a SOA. This paper presents SOABench, a framework for the automatic generation and execution of testbeds for benchmarking middleware for composite Web services and for assessing the performance of existing SOA infrastructures. SOABench defines a testbed model characterized by the composite services to execute, the workload to generate, the deployment configuration to use, the performance metrics to gather, the data analyses to perform on them, and the reports to produce. We have validated SOABench by benchmarking the performance of different BPEL engines.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Domenico Bianculli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bianculli:Domenico", "Walter Binder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Binder:Walter", "Mauro Luigi Drago.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drago:Mauro_Luigi"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
