{"title": "Extracting Information Seeking Intentions for Web Search Sessions.", "fields": ["information seeking", "copy editing", "information retrieval", "multimedia", "personalization"], "abstract": "We present a method for extracting the self-reported intentions of users engaged in an information seeking episode. We recruited participants to conduct search sessions and subsequently asked them to self-report their intentions. A total of 27 users participated in a lab study, during which they worked on two search tasks. After each search session, participants indicated their intentions during that session while viewing a video replay. Results indicate that the set of search intentions provided to participants was sufficient to account for intentions in four journalism-related information seeking tasks: a copy editing task, interview preparation task, relationships task, and story pitch task. The results also suggest regular patterns in intentions that can be exploited for identification of task type as well as potential applications to personalization and recommendation during a search episode.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Matthew Mitsui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitsui:Matthew", "Chirag Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Chirag", "Nicholas J.
