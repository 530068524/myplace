Therefore, parsing errors inevitably lead to labeling mistakes. To alleviate this problem, we propose to use packed forest, which compactly encodes all parses for a sentence. We design an algorithm to exploit exponentially many parses to learn semantic relations efficiently. Experimental results on the CoNLL-2005 shared task show that using forests achieves an absolute improvement of 1.2% in terms of F1 score over using 1-best parses and 0.6% over using 50-best parses.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Hao Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Hao", "Haitao Mi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mi:Haitao", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Yang", "Qun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qun"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
