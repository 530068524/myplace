In relation to the above question, we put forward the following quantified derandomization challenge:  For a class of circuits  C  (e.g.,  P /poly or  AC  0 ,  AC  0 [2]) and a bounding function  B : N \u2192 N (e.g.,  B ( n ) =  n   log n   or  B ( n ) = exp( n  0.99 ))), given an  n -input circuit  C  from  C  that evaluates to 1 on all but at most  B ( n ) of its inputs, find (in deterministic polynomial-time) an input  x  such that  C ( x ) = 1. Indeed, the  standard  derandomization challenge for the class  C  corresponds to the case of  B ( n ) = 2  n /2  (or to  B ( n ) = 2  n  /3 for the two-sided version case). Our main results regarding the new  quantified  challenge are:   1. Solving the  quantified  derandomization challenge for the class  AC  0  and every sub-exponential bounding function (e.g.,  B ( n ) = exp( n  0.999 )).   2. Showing that solving the  quantified  derandomization challenge for the class  AC  0 [2] and any sub-exponential bounding function (e.g.,  B ( n ) = exp( n  0.001 )), implies solving the  standard  derandomization challenge for the class  AC  0 [2] (i.e., for  B ( n ) = 2  n  /2).   Analogous results are obtained also for stronger (Black-box) forms of efficient derandomization like hitting-set generators.   We also obtain results for other classes of computational devices including log-space algorithms and Arithmetic circuits. For the latter we present a deterministic polynomial-time hitting set generator for the class of  n -variate polynomials of degree  d  over GF(2) that evaluate to 0 on at most an  O (2 - d  ) fraction of their inputs.   In general, the quantified derandomization problem raises a variety of seemingly unexplored questions about many randomized complexity classes, and may offer a tractable approach to unconditional derandomization for some of them.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Institute for Advanced Study"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Oded Goldreich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldreich_0001:Oded", "Avi Wigderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigderson:Avi"], "pages": 10}
