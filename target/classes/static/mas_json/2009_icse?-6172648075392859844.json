SQL Injection (SQLI) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are widespread forms of attack in which the attacker crafts the input to the application to access or modify user data and execute malicious code. In the most serious attacks (called second-order, or persistent, XSS), an attacker can corrupt a database so as to cause subsequent users to execute malicious code.", "citation": "Citations (386)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Stanford University", "Syracuse University", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Adam Kiezun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiezun:Adam", "Philip J.
