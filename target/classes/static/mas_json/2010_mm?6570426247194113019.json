However, due to limited computational power on these devices, a good mobile application requires far more considerations in algorithm design and optimization than for desktop systems. This demo shows two multimedia applications on a mobile phone: mobile visual search and panorama. The innovative components of the system include hybrid tracking and visual matching, optimal region classification and feature selection for faster and more reliable image-related applications, and an optimized image processing pipeline for multimedia applications on a mobile phone.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nokia"], "authors": ["Jiang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jiang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
