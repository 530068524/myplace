{"title": "Modeling video evolution for action recognition.", "fields": ["3d single object recognition", "machine learning", "video tracking", "gesture", "ranking"], "abstract": "In this paper we present a method to capture video-wide temporal information for action recognition. We postulate that a function capable of ordering the frames of a video temporally (based on the appearance) captures well the evolution of the appearance within the video. We learn such ranking functions per video via a ranking machine and use the parameters of these as a new video representation. The proposed method is easy to interpret and implement, fast to compute and effective in recognizing a wide variety of actions. We perform a large number of evaluations on datasets for generic action recognition (Hollywood2 and HMDB51), fine-grained actions (MPII- cooking activities) and gestures (Chalearn). Results show that the proposed method brings an absolute improvement of 7\u201310%, while being compatible with and complementary to further improvements in appearance and local motion based methods.", "citation": "Citations (195)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Basura Fernando.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fernando:Basura", "Efstratios Gavves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavves:Efstratios", "Jos\u00e9 Oramas M......http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=:Jos=eacute=_Oramas", "Amir Ghodrati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghodrati:Amir", "Tinne Tuytelaars.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tuytelaars:Tinne"], "pages": 10}
