{"title": "Automatically Leveraging MapReduce Frameworks for Data-Intensive Applications.", "fields": ["functional specification", "executable", "program synthesis", "programming paradigm", "compiler"], "abstract": "MapReduce is a popular programming paradigm for developing large-scale, data-intensive computation. Many frameworks that implement this paradigm have recently been developed. To leverage these frameworks, however, developers must become familiar with their APIs and rewrite existing code. We present Casper, a new tool that automatically translates sequential Java programs into the MapReduce paradigm. Casper identifies potential code fragments to rewrite and translates them in two steps: (1) Casper uses program synthesis to search for a program summary (i.e., a functional specification) of each code fragment. The summary is expressed using a high-level intermediate language resembling the MapReduce paradigm and verified to be semantically equivalent to the original using a theorem prover. (2) Casper generates executable code from the summary, using either the Hadoop, Spark, or Flink API. We evaluated Casper by automatically converting real-world, sequential Java benchmarks to MapReduce. The resulting benchmarks perform up to 48.2x faster compared to the original.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Maaz Bin Safeer Ahmad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmad:Maaz_Bin_Safeer", "Alvin Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Alvin"], "pages": 16}
