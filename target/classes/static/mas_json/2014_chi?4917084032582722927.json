We present a diary study of 36 individuals that provides an overview of how group coordination is currently performed as well as the challenges people face. Our findings highlight that people primarily use open-channel communication tools (e.g., text messaging, phone calls, email) to coordinate because the alternatives are seen as either disrupting or curbing to the natural conversational processes. Yet the use of open-channel tools often results in conversational overload and a significant disparity of work between coordinating individuals. This in turn often leads to a sense of frustration and confusion about coordination details. We discuss how the findings argue for a significant shift in our thinking about the design of coordination support systems.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["New Jersey Institute of Technology", "Eastern Connecticut State University", "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "New Jersey Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Richard P.
