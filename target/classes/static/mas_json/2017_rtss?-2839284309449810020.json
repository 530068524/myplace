{"title": "An O(Log Log m)-Competitive Algorithm for Online Machine Minimization.", "fields": ["job shop scheduling", "exponential growth", "schedule", "log log plot", "competitive analysis"], "abstract": "This paper considers the online machine minimization problem, a basic real time scheduling problem. The setting for this problem consists of n jobs that arrive over time, where each job has a deadline by which it must be completed. The goal is to design an online scheduler that feasibly schedules the jobs on a nearly minimal number of machines. An algorithm is c-machine optimal if the algorithm will feasibly schedule a collection of jobs on c \u00b7m machines if there exists a feasible schedule on m machines. For over two decades the best known result was a O(log P)-machine optimal algorithm, where P is the ratio of the maximum to minimum job size. In a recent breakthrough, a O(log m)-machine optimal algorithm was given. In this paper, we exponentially improve on this recent result by giving a O(log log m)-machine optimal algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Merced", "University of Washington", "University of Pittsburgh", "Columbia University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Sungjin Im.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Im:Sungjin", "Benjamin Moseley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moseley:Benjamin", "Kirk Pruhs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pruhs:Kirk", "Clifford Stein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stein:Clifford"], "pages": 8}
