{"title": "Randomizable Proofs and Delegatable Anonymous Credentials.", "fields": ["security parameter", "digital credential", "discrete mathematics", "zero knowledge proof", "computer science", "proof of knowledge", "theoretical computer science", "mathematical proof", "commitment scheme"], "abstract": "We construct an efficient delegatable anonymous credentials system. Users can anonymously and unlinkably obtain credentials from any authority, delegate their credentials to other users, and prove possession of a credential L levels away from a given authority. The size of the proof (and time to compute it) is O(Lk), where k is the security parameter. The only other construction of delegatable anonymous credentials (Chase and Lysyanskaya, Crypto 2006) relies on general non-interactive proofs for NP-complete languages of size k ?(2 L ). We revise the entire approach to constructing anonymous credentials and identify randomizable zero-knowledge proof of knowledge systems as the key building block. We formally define the notion of randomizable non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and give the first instance of controlled rerandomization of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs by a third-party. Our construction uses Groth-Sahai proofs (Eurocrypt 2008).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "IBM", "Microsoft", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Brown University"], "authors": ["Mira Belenkiy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belenkiy:Mira", "Jan Camenisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camenisch:Jan", "Melissa Chase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chase:Melissa", "Markulf Kohlweiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohlweiss:Markulf", "Anna Lysyanskaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lysyanskaya:Anna", "Hovav Shacham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shacham:Hovav"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2009", "pages": 18}
