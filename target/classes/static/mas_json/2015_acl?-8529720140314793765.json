However, the previous neural models cannot extract the complicated feature compositions as the traditional methods with discrete features. In this paper, we propose a gated recursive neural network (GRNN) for Chinese word segmentation, which contains reset and update gates to incorporate the complicated combinations of the context characters. Since GRNN is relative deep, we also use a supervised layer-wise training method to avoid the problem of gradient diffusion. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms the previous neural network models as well as the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xinchi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xinchi", "Xipeng Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Xipeng", "Chenxi Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Chenxi", "Xuanjing Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xuanjing"], "pages": 10}
