Notably, we do not use articulated limb parts, but rather capture orientation with a mixture of templates for each part. We describe a general, flexible mixture model for capturing contextual co-occurrence relations between parts, augmenting standard spring models that encode spatial relations. We show that such relations can capture notions of local rigidity. When co-occurrence and spatial relations are tree-structured, our model can be efficiently optimized with dynamic programming. We present experimental results on standard benchmarks for pose estimation that indicate our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, outperforming past work by 50% while being orders of magnitude faster.", "citation": "Citations (1,017)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0007:Yi", "Deva Ramanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanan:Deva"], "pages": 8}
