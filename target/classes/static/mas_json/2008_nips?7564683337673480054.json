These representations are typically high dimensional and assume diverse forms. Thus finding a way to transform them into a unified space of lower dimension generally facilitates the underlying tasks, such as object recognition or clustering. We describe an approach that incorporates multiple kernel learning with dimensionality reduction (MKL-DR). While the proposed framework is flexible in simultaneously tackling data in various feature representations, the formulation itself is general in that it is established upon graph embedding. It follows that any dimensionality reduction techniques explainable by graph embedding can be generalized by our method to consider data in multiple feature representations.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "Academia Sinica", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yen-Yu Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Yen=Yu", "Tyng-Luh Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tyng=Luh", "Chiou-Shann Fuh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuh:Chiou=Shann"], "pages": 8}
