While some concepts for mobile video browsing have been presented, the field still lacks a general understanding of the design space and of the characteristics of interaction concepts. In order to improve user interfaces for mobile video browsing, this paper includes three contributions. First, we setup a design space for mobile video browsing and contribute seven novel interface concepts. They rely on GUI-based, on touch-gesture-based, and on physical interaction. Second, we present the results of an in-depth evaluation and comparison of these concepts. They are based on an ascriptive analysis of 18 hours of video observations from a controlled experiment with 44 participants. The results provide insights into common usability errors and misconceptions. Third, we derive implications for the design of mobile video browsers to minimize errors and to increase usability.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Jochen Huber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huber:Jochen", "J\u00fcrgen Steimle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steimle:J=uuml=rgen", "Max M\u00fchlh\u00e4user.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=hlh=auml=user:Max"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
