{"title": "Communication-Efficient Distributed Optimization using an Approximate Newton-type Method.", "fields": ["stochastic optimization", "quadratic equation", "machine learning", "empirical evidence", "rate of convergence"], "abstract": "We present a novel Newton-type method for distributed optimization, which is particularly well suited for stochastic optimization and learning problems. For quadratic objectives, the method enjoys a linear rate of convergence which provably improves with the data size, requiring an essentially constant number of iterations under reasonable assumptions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence of the advantages of our method compared to other approaches, such as one-shot parameter averaging and ADMM.", "citation": "Citations (120)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ohad Shamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamir:Ohad", "Nathan Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nathan", "Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Tong"], "pages": 9}
