In order to do that, we develop a technique, which we believe can have further applications, of approximating Chase(D, cal T), for a database instance D and a set of tuple generating dependencies and data log rules cal T, by an infinite sequence of finite structures, all of them being models of cal T and D.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw", "School of Informatics"], "authors": ["Tomasz Gogacz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gogacz:Tomasz", "Jerzy Marcinkowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marcinkowski:Jerzy"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
