Bottom-up and top-down parsers typically require a completed string as input. This requirement makes it difficult to incorporate them into phrase-based translation, which generates partial hypothesized translations from left-to-right. Incremental syntactic language models score sentences in a similar left-to-right fashion, and are therefore a good mechanism for incorporating syntax into phrase-based translation. We give a formal definition of one such lineartime syntactic language model, detail its relation to phrase-based decoding, and integrate the model with the Moses phrase-based translation system. We present empirical results on a constrained Urdu-English translation task that demonstrate a significant BLEU score improvement and a large decrease in perplexity.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Air Force Research Laboratory", "Johns Hopkins University", "Ohio State University", "Mayo Clinic"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Lane Schwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwartz:Lane", "Chris Callison-Burch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Callison=Burch:Chris", "William Schuler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuler:William", "Stephen T.
