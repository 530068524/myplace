This paper describes the results of a research project in the intersection of HCI and Futures Studies as well as in the intersection between \"the future information society\" and sustainability. We here present parts of the body of materials that were developed in a multi-year research project with the aim of describing and evaluating the sustainability impact of possible future information societies. We also discuss some of the lessons learned and what HCI and design fiction can learn from Futures Studies in general and from this project in particular. The main stakeholders in this project have been city administrators and corporate partners, and the overarching goal has primarily been to influence planning processes at the regional (Stockholm, Sweden) level.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Pargman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pargman:Daniel", "Elina Eriksson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eriksson:Elina", "Mattias H\u00f6jer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=jer:Mattias", "Ulrika Gunnarsson \u00d6stling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ouml=stling:Ulrika_Gunnarsson", "Luciane Aguiar Borges.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borges:Luciane_Aguiar"], "pages": 13}
