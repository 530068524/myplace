{"title": "A Taxonomy, Dataset, and Classifier for Automatic Noun Compound Interpretation.", "fields": ["taxonomy", "pattern recognition", "noun", "classifier", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "The automatic interpretation of noun-noun compounds is an important subproblem within many natural language processing applications and is an area of increasing interest. The problem is difficult, with disagreement regarding the number and nature of the relations, low inter-annotator agreement, and limited annotated data. In this paper, we present a novel taxonomy of relations that integrates previous relations, the largest publicly-available annotated dataset, and a supervised classification method for automatic noun compound interpretation.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Stephen Tratz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tratz:Stephen", "Eduard H.
