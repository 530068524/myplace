We approximate the L p -norm using a distance function, d(\u2022,\u2022) based on a randomly shifted quad-tree. The algorithm iteratively generates an approximate minimum-cost augmenting path under d(\u2022,\u2022) in time proportional to the length of the path. We show that the total length of the augmenting paths generated by the algorithm is O((n/e)log n), implying that the running time of our algorithm is O(n poly(log n,1/e)).", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["R.
