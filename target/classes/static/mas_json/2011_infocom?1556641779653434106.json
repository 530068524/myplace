This problem has received much attention starting with the work of Grossglauser and Tse (2002), and it has been shown that there is a significant tradeoff between the end-to-end delays and the total achievable rate. We develop algorithms to compute such tradeoffs with provable performance guarantees for arbitrary instances, with general interference models. Given a target delay-bound \u0394( c ) for each session  c , our algorithm gives a stable flow vector with a total throughput within a factor of  O (log \u0394  m  /log \u0394  m  ) of the maximum, so that the persession (end-to-end) delay is  O (((log \u0394  m  /log log \u0394  m  )\u0394( c )) 2 ), where \u0394  m   = max  c  {\u0394( c )}; note that these bounds depend only on the delays, and not on the network size, and this is the first such result, to our knowledge.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Virginia Bioinformatics Institute", "IBM", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Virginia Bioinformatics Institute", "Virginia Bioinformatics Institute", "Virginia Bioinformatics Institute", "IBM", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Guanhong Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Guanhong", "V.
