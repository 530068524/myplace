However, the lack of a uniform framework and a reasonable evaluation method makes it a puzzle to analyze, compare and evaluate the extensive work, let alone picking out a best one when necessary. In this paper, we design a tool called CoDAR, which reveals the generalized procedure of community detection and monitors the real-time structural changes of network during the detection process. Moreover, CoDAR adopts 12 recognized metrics and builds a rating model for performance evaluation of communities to recom- mend the best-performing algorithm. Finally, the tool also provides nice interactive windows for display.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Xiang Ying.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ying:Xiang", "Chaokun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chaokun", "Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Meng", "Jeffrey Xu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jeffrey_Xu", "Jun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jun"], "pages": 4}
