{"title": "Text entry performance of state of the art unconstrained handwriting recognition: a longitudinal user study.", "fields": ["software", "handwriting", "handwriting recognition", "longitudinal study", "word error rate"], "abstract": "We report on a longitudinal study of unconstrained handwriting recognition performance. After 250 minutes of practice, participants had a mean text entry rate of 24.1 wpm. For the first four hours of usage, entry and error rates of handwriting recognition are about the same as for a baseline QWERTY software keyboard. Our results reveal that unconstrained handwriting is faster than what was previously assumed in the text entry literature.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Per Ola Kristensson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kristensson:Per_Ola", "Leif C.
