{"title": "faBrickation: fast 3D printing of functional objects by integrating construction kit building blocks.", "fields": ["multimedia", "computer graphics images", "3d printing", "rapid prototyping", "optical path"], "abstract": "We present a new approach to rapid prototyping of functional objects, such as the body of a head-mounted display. The key idea is to save 3D printing time by automatically substituting sub-volumes with standard building blocks -- in our case Lego bricks. When making the body for a head-mounted display, for example, getting the optical path right is paramount. Users thus mark the lens mounts as \"high-resolution\" to indicate that these should be 3D printed. faBrickator then 3D-prints only these parts. It also generates instructions that show users how to create everything else from Lego bricks. If users iterate on the design later, fa-Brickator offers even greater benefit as it allows re-printing only the elements that changed. We validated our system at the example of three 3D models of functional objects. On average, our system fabricates objects 2.44 times faster than traditional 3d printing while requiring only 14 minutes of manual assembly.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Stefanie Mueller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mueller_0001:Stefanie", "Tobias Mohr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohr:Tobias", "Kerstin Guenther.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guenther:Kerstin", "Johannes Frohnhofen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frohnhofen:Johannes", "Patrick Baudisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baudisch:Patrick"], "pages": 8}
