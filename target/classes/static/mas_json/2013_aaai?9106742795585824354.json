{"title": "Bundling Attacks in Judgment Aggregation.", "fields": ["almost surely", "partition", "computer security", "bundle", "welfare economics"], "abstract": "We consider judgment aggregation over multiple independent issues, where the chairperson has her own opinion, and can try to bias the outcome by bundling several issues together. Since for each bundle judges must give a uniform answer on all issues, different partitions of the issues may result in an outcome that significantly differs from the \"true\", issue-wise, decision.\n\nWe prove that the bundling problem faced by the chairperson, i.e. trying to bias the outcome towards her own opinion, is computationally difficult in the worst case. Then we study the probability that an effective bundling attack exists as the disparity between the opinions of the judges and the chair varies. We show that if every judge initially agrees with the chair on every issue with probability of at least 1/2, then there is almost always a bundling attack (i.e. a partition) where the opinion of the chair on all issues is approved. Moreover, such a partition can be found efficiently. In contrast, when the probability is lower than 1/2 then the chair cannot force her opinion using bundling even on a single issue.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Queen Mary University of London", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Noga Alon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alon:Noga", "Dvir Falik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Falik:Dvir", "Reshef Meir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meir:Reshef", "Moshe Tennenholtz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tennenholtz:Moshe"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
