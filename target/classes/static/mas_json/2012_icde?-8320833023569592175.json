Since current database systems do not provide integrated support for forecasting, it is usually done outside the database system by specially trained experts using forecast models. However, integrating model-based forecasting as a first-class citizen inside a DBMS speeds up the forecasting process by avoiding exporting the data and by applying database-related optimizations like reusing created forecast models. It especially allows subsequent processing of forecast results inside the database. In this demo, we present our prototype F2DB based on PostgreSQL, which allows for transparent processing of forecast queries. Our system automatically takes care of model maintenance when the underlying dataset changes. In addition, we offer optimizations to save maintenance costs and increase accuracy by using derivation schemes for multidimensional data. Our approach reduces the required expert knowledge by enabling arbitrary users to apply forecasting in a declarative way.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Ulrike Fischer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischer:Ulrike", "Frank Rosenthal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenthal:Frank", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
