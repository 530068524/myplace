{"title": "B2B-Swipe: Swipe Gesture for Rectangular Smartwatches from a Bezel to a Bezel.", "fields": ["vocabulary", "wearable computer", "swipe", "gesture", "smartwatch"], "abstract": "We present B2B-Swipe, a single-finger swipe gesture for a rectangular smartwatch that starts at a bezel and ends at a bezel to enrich input vocabulary. There are 16 possible B2B-Swipes because a rectangular smartwatch has four bezels. Moreover, B2B-Swipe can be implemented with a single-touch screen with no additional hardware. Our study shows that B2B-Swipe can co-exist with Bezel Swipe and Flick, with an error rate of 3.7% under the sighted condition and 8.0% under the eyes-free condition. Furthermore, B2B-Swipe is potentially accurate (i.e., the error rates were 0% and 0.6% under the sighted and eyes-free conditions) if the system uses only B2B-Swipes for touch gestures.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yuki Kubo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kubo:Yuki", "Buntarou Shizuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shizuki:Buntarou", "Jiro Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Jiro"], "pages": 5}
