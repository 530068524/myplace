In this paper, we consider the problem of classification based on such indefinite similarities. These indefinite kernels can be problematic for standard kernel-based algorithms as the optimization problems become non-convex and the underlying theory is invalidated. In order to adapt kernel methods for similarity-based learning, we introduce a method that aims to simultaneously find a reproducing kernel Hilbert space based on the given similarities and train a classifier with good generalization in that space. The method is formulated as a convex optimization problem. We propose a simplified version that can reduce overfitting and whose associated convex conic program can be solved efficiently. We compare the proposed simplified version with six other methods on a collection of real data sets.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yihua Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yihua", "Maya R.
