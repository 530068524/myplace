We focus on how the complexity of those projects was measured, and how the success of the students in effectively and efficiently taming that complexity was assessed. This required defining, collecting, validating and analyzing several indicators of size, effort and quality; their rationales, advantages and limitations are discussed. The resulting findings helped to improve the process itself.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Federal Univers ... s|Rua dos Oitis"], "authors": ["Wilson Padua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padua:Wilson"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
