It has however limitations for protocols and web services that are based on databases of keys, contracts, or even access rights, where revocation is possible, so that the set of true facts does not monotonically grow with state transitions. We extend the scope of these over-approximation methods by defining a new way of abstraction that can handle such databases, and we formally prove that the abstraction is sound. We realize a translator from a convenient specification language to standard Horn clauses and use the verifier ProVerif and the theorem prover SPASS to solve them. We show by a number of examples that this approach is practically feasible for wide variety of verification problems of security protocols and web services", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Technical University of Denmark"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Sebastian M\u00f6dersheim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=ouml=dersheim:Sebastian"], "pages": 10}
