Drawing on our engagement with disaster response teams, including ethnography of their training work, we unpack the ways in which situational uncertainty is managed while a shared operational 'picture' is constituted through various practices around tabletop work. Our analysis reveals how this picture is collaboratively assembled as a socially shared object and displayed by drawing on digital and physical resources. Accordingly, we provide a range of principles implicated by our study that guide the design of systems augmenting and enriching disaster response work practices. In turn, we propose the Augmented Bird Table to illustrate how our principles can be implemented to support tabletop work.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Oxford", "University of Southampton"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Joel E.
