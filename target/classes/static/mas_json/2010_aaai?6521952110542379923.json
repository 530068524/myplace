In our previous work, we considered the problem of establishing and maintaining a formation of robots given an already connected network. We now propose a distributed auction-based method to autonomously initialize and reorganize the network structure of a formation of robots.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Mobile Robotics ... wardsville, IL", "Mobile Robotics ... wardsville, IL"], "authors": ["Robert Louis Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Robert_Louis", "Ross Mead.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mead:Ross", "Jerry B.
