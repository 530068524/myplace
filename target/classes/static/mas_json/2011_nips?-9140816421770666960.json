{"title": "Message-Passing for Approximate MAP Inference with Latent Variables.", "fields": ["latent variable", "graphical model", "inference", "maximum a posteriori estimation", "hybrid algorithm"], "abstract": "We consider a general inference setting for discrete probabilistic graphical models where we seek maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for a subset of the random variables (max nodes), marginalizing over the rest (sum nodes). We present a hybrid message-passing algorithm to accomplish this. The hybrid algorithm passes a mix of sum and max messages depending on the type of source node (sum or max). We derive our algorithm by showing that it falls out as the solution of a particular relaxation of a variational framework. We further show that the Expectation Maximization algorithm can be seen as an approximation to our algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets, against several baselines, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Utah", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Jiarong Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Jiarong", "Piyush Rai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rai:Piyush", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
