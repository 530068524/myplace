In this paper, we develop the first concolic testing approach for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). More specifically, we utilise quantified linear arithmetic over rationals to express test requirements that have been studied in the literature, and then develop a coherent method to perform concolic testing with the aim of better coverage. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the concolic testing approach in both achieving high coverage and finding adversarial examples.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Liverpool", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Youcheng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Youcheng", "Min Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Min", "Wenjie Ruan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruan:Wenjie", "Xiaowei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xiaowei", "Marta Kwiatkowska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwiatkowska:Marta", "Daniel Kroening.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kroening:Daniel"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
