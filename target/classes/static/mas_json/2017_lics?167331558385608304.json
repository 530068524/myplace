Specifically, we show that the multiplicativity of the determinant function over the integers is provable in the bounded arithmetic theory VNC 2 , which is a first-order theory corresponding to the complexity class NC 2 . This also establishes the existence of uniform polynomial-size and O(log 2 n)-depth Circuit-Frege (equivalently, Extended Frege) proofs over the integers, of the basic determinant identities (previous proofs hold only over GF(2)). In doing so, we give uniform NC 2 -algorithms for homogenizing algebraic circuits, balancing algebraic circuits (given as input an upper bound on the syntactic-degree of the circuit), and converting circuits with divisions into circuits with a single division gate\u2014all (\u03a3 1  B -) definable in VNC 2 . This also implies an NC 2 -algorithm for evaluating algebraic circuits of any depth.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Royal Holloway, University of London", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Iddo Tzameret.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tzameret:Iddo", "Stephen A.
