However, all current cryptographic instantiations for general FE are too impractical to be implemented. We construct IRON, a provably secure, and practical FE system using Intel's recent Software Guard Extensions (SGX). We show that IRON can be applied to complex functionalities, and even for simple functions, outperforms the best known cryptographic schemes. We argue security by modeling FE in the context of hardware elements, and prove that IRON satisfies the security model.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of Waterloo", "Stanford University", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Ben Fisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fisch:Ben", "Dhinakaran Vinayagamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vinayagamurthy:Dhinakaran", "Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan", "Sergey Gorbunov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorbunov:Sergey"], "pages": 18}
