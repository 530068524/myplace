{"title": "Understanding Feedback Expectations on Facebook.", "fields": ["social media", "social connectedness", "feeling", "computer mediated communication", "information sharing"], "abstract": "When people share updates with their friends on Facebook they have varying expectations for the feedback they will receive. In this study, we quantitatively examine the factors contributing to feedback expectations and the potential outcomes of expectation fulfillment. We conducted two sets of surveys: one asking people about their feedback expectations immediately after posting on Facebook and the other asking how the amount of feedback received on a post matched the participant's expectations. Participants were more likely to expect feedback on content they evaluated as more important, and to a lesser extent more personal. Expectations also depended on participants' age, gender, and level of activity on Facebook. When asked about feedback expectations from specific friends, participants were more likely to expect feedback from closer friends, but expectations varied considerably based on recency of communication, geographical proximity, and the type of relationship (e.g. family, co-worker). Finally, receiving more feedback relative to expectations correlated with a greater feeling of connectedness to one's Facebook friends. The findings suggest implications for the theory and the design of social network sites.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Nir Grinberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grinberg:Nir", "Shankar Kalyanaraman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalyanaraman:Shankar", "Lada A.
