{"title": "Unsupervised Modeling of Dialog Acts in Asynchronous Conversations.", "fields": ["dialog box", "conversation", "probabilistic logic", "asynchronous communication", "structural similarity"], "abstract": "We present unsupervised approaches to the problem of modeling dialog acts in asynchronous conversations; i.e., conversations where participants collaborate with each other at different times. In particular, we investigate a graph-theoretic deterministic framework and two probabilistic conversation models (i.e., HMM and HMM+Mix) for modeling dialog acts in emails and forums. We train and test our conversation models on (a) temporal order and (b) graph-structural order of the datasets. Empirical evaluation suggests (i) the graph-theoretic framework that relies on lexical and structural similarity metrics is not the right model for this task, (ii) conversation models perform better on the graph-structural order than the temporal order of the datasets and (iii) HMM+Mix is a better conversation model than the simple HMM model.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "Microsoft"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Shafiq R.
