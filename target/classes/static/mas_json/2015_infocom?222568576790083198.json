The enhanced inter cell interference coordination (eICIC) has been proposed to protect downlink pico cell transmissions by mitigating interference from neighboring macro cells. The adaptive eICIC configuration problem is studied in this paper to adjust the parameters including the ratio of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS) and the bias of cell range expansion (RE). We formulate the problem as a general form consensus problem with regularization, and solve the problem by providing an efficient distributed optimization framework. Our algorithm is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in which the solutions to local subproblems on each macro cell and pico cell are coordinated to find a solution to the global problem for the whole network. We also propose the dynamic programming based algorithms to solve the local subproblems on macro cell or pico cell. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared with existing approaches, and verify the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Hao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Hao", "Yusheng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Yusheng", "Xiaoyan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Xiaoyan", "Baohua Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Baohua"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
