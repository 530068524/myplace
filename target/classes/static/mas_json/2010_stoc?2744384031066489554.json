This containment is proved by applying a parallelized form of the matrix multiplicative weights update method to a class of semidefinite programs that captures the computational power of quantum interactive proofs. As the containment of PSPACE in QIP follows immediately from the well-known equality IP = PSPACE, the equality QIP = PSPACE follows.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "National University of Singapore", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "National University of Singapore", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Rahul Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0001:Rahul", "Zhengfeng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Zhengfeng", "Sarvagya Upadhyay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Upadhyay:Sarvagya", "John Watrous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watrous:John"], "pages": 10}
