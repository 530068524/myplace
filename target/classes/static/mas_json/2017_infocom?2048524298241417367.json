Such critical network scenarios call for an outright prevention mechanism against contact-based attacks, e.g., blackmailing a legitimate user to compromise sensitive information at a contact. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work on secure routing protocol against contact-based attacks in DTNs. Therefore, in this paper, we first formulate the problem of contact avoidance routing, in which the node holding a message tries to avoid having a contact with an adversary. By applying the phase-type distribution, we build the secure opportunistic path model, which integrates the delivery probability within the deadline and the safety of opportunistic paths. Then, we propose a contact avoidance routing (CAR) protocol to securely deliver a message to its destination against the contact-based compromise attack. In addition, we further propose an adaptive CAR (A-CAR) to accommodate complicated network scenarios, where the capabilities of adversaries are parameterized. The extensive simulations using real traces as well as random graphs demonstrate that the proposed CAR and A-CAR protocols achieve their design goals.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tokyo Metropolitan University", "Tokyo Metropolitan University", "Tokyo Metropolitan University"], "authors": ["Tomoya Osuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osuki:Tomoya", "Kazuya Sakai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakai:Kazuya", "Satoshi Fukumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukumoto:Satoshi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
