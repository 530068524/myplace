We experimentally investigated the effects of altering seating positions on conversations in four-person group communication, two-by-two at identical locations: distant parties seated across from each other vs. distant parties seated side-by-side. In the latter seating arrangement, we found that speaker switches were more evenly distributed between distance-separated participants and co-located participants at points without verbal indication of the next speaker. Participants shared a higher sense of unity and reached a slightly better group solution. These findings demonstrate the importance of providing people with various seating arrangements across distant sites to facilitate different group activities.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "University of Tsukuba", "NTT Communicati ... , Atsugi, Japan", "NTT Communicati ... , Atsugi, Japan"], "authors": ["Naomi Yamashita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamashita:Naomi", "Keiji Hirata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirata:Keiji", "Shigemi Aoyagi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aoyagi:Shigemi", "Hideaki Kuzuoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuzuoka:Hideaki", "Yasunori Harada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harada:Yasunori"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
