{"title": "Bezier Surface Editing Using Marker-based Augmented Reality.", "fields": ["bezier curve", "bezier surface", "augmented reality", "user interface", "tangible user interface"], "abstract": "This paper describes a marker-based Augmented Reality system for editing tensor-product Bezier surfaces. It uses both a small- scale multi-marker mat and a two-marker wand as its interactive elements. The multi-marker mat establishes a coordinate frame for the display of the surface. Because of its size, it allows the user to rotate and translate the mat physically, even while editing it. The wand is used to select individual control points and edit their 3D position with respect to the surface's coordinate frame. Differentiation between selection and modification is accomplished through a bimodal association of two markers at the end of the wand. The wand's mode is switched by rolling it between the fingers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Alabama at Birmingham", "University of Alabama at Birmingham"], "authors": ["David O'Gwynn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Gwynn:David", "John Johnstone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnstone:John"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
