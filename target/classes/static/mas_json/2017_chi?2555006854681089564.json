Congenitally, interactive technologies and ubiquitous environments shape our opportunities for enacting social relations. Proxemics and Spatial Sharing have been suggested as foundations for our understanding of the socio-spatial aspects of computing. By tandeming these theoretical perspectives in a set of cases in the office domain, we develop a contribution comprised of 3 key sensitizing concepts:  Proxemic Malleability, Proxemic Threshold and Proxemic Gravity  articulating socio-spatial qualities at the interplay between interactive systems, spaces, interior elements and co-located people. The sensitizing concepts qualify interaction designers in considering proxemic consequences of technology design; they serve both as analytic lenses and as generative instruments in a design process. The proposed sensitizing concepts and the theoretical work of the paper contribute to enhanced Socio-spatial literacy in HCI.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Microsoft", "Aarhus University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Peter Gall Krogh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krogh:Peter_Gall", "Marianne Graves Petersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petersen:Marianne_Graves", "Kenton O'Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Hara:Kenton", "Jens Emil Groenbaek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Groenbaek:Jens_Emil"], "pages": 12}
