For centuries, pictures of motion (e.g., the revolutionary photographs by Marey and Muybridge of galloping horses and other animals, da Vinci's detailed drawings of hydrodynamics) have factored importantly in making scientific discoveries possible. Today, there is perhaps no tool more powerful than interactive virtual reality (VR) for conveying complex space-time data to scientists, doctors, and others; however, relatively little is known about how to design virtual environments in order to best facilitate these analyses.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "Minneapolis College of Art and Design"], "authors": ["Dane M.
