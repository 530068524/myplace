This problem occurs when considering music data. In this paper, we introduce a model for rhythms based on the distributions of distances between subsequences. A specific implementation of the model when considering Hamming distances over a simple rhythm representation is described. The proposed model consistently outperforms a standard Hidden Markov Model in terms of conditional prediction accuracy on two different music databases.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Idiap Research Institute", "Idiap Research Institute", "Google", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Paiement.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paiement:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois", "Yves Grandvalet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grandvalet:Yves", "Samy Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Samy", "Douglas Eck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eck:Douglas"], "pages": 8}
