{"title": "Hitchhike: Riding control on preambles.", "fields": ["network packet", "data loss", "payload", "channel"], "abstract": "Recently, carrying control signals on passing data packets has emerged as a promising direction for efficient control information transmission. With control messages carried on data payload, the extra air time needed for control packets like RTS/CTS is eliminated and thus channel utilization is improved. However, carrying control signals on the data payload of a packet requires the data packet to have a sufficiently large SNR, otherwise both the data packet and the control messages are lost. In this paper, we propose Hitchhike, a technique that utilizes the preamble field to carry control messages. Hitchhike completely decouples the control messages from the payload and therefore the superposition of (multiple) control messages has little adverse effect on the operation of the payload decoding. We implement and evaluate Hitchhike in the USRP2 platform with 5 nodes. Evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of Hitchhike. Compared with the state-of-the-art, e.g., Side-channel in 802.15.4, Hitchhike improves the detection accuracy of control messages by 40% and reduces the data loss caused by control messages by 15%.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Tsinghua University", "University of Michigan", "University of Science and Technology, Sana'a", "University of Science and Technology, Sana'a"], "authors": ["Xiaoyu Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Xiaoyu", "Jiliang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jiliang", "Mingyan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Mingyan", "Yubo Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Yubo", "Panlong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Panlong", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
