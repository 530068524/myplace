To achieve this, queries are executed over fast changing data from distributed sources. As these queries require data from multiple sources, these queries are executed at an intermediate proxy or data aggregator. Typically, users of these queries are not interested in all the data updates. Query results may be associated with an imprecision bound or threshold which can be used to limit the number of refresh messages.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["IBM", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "authors": ["Rajeev Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Rajeev", "Krithi Ramamritham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramamritham:Krithi"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
