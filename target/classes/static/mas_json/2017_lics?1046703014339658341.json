It rose to prominence following the work of Thomas, who established an exact correspondence with the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level contains languages that can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. One of the most famous open problems in automata theory is to obtain membership algorithms for all levels in this hierarchy.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["L'Abri", "L'Abri"], "authors": ["Thomas Place.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Place:Thomas", "Marc Zeitoun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeitoun:Marc"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
