{"title": "The Product Cut.", "fields": ["data set", "multiplicative function", "mathematical optimization", "mathematics", "graph partition"], "abstract": "We introduce a theoretical and algorithmic framework for multi-way graph partitioning that relies on a multiplicative cut-based objective. We refer to this objective as the Product Cut. We provide a detailed investigation of the mathematical properties of this objective and an effective algorithm for its optimization. The proposed model has strong mathematical underpinnings, and the corresponding algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data sets.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Loyola Marymount University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "City University of New York"], "authors": ["Thomas Laurent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laurent_0001:Thomas", "James H. von Brecht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brecht:James_H=_von", "Xavier Bresson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bresson:Xavier", "Arthur Szlam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szlam:Arthur"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
