This demands a routing path to be constructed traversing all sensors in that area, which is also called to linearize the network. In this paper, we present SURF, a Space filling cURve construction scheme for high genus 3D surFace WSNs, yielding a traversal path provably aperiodic (that is, any node is covered at most a constant number of times). SURF first utilizes the hop-count distance function to construct the iso-contour in discrete settings, then it uses the concept of the Reeb graph and the maximum cut set to divide the network into different regions. Finally it conducts a novel serial traversal scheme, enabling the traversal within and between regions. To the best of our knowledge, SURF is the first high genus 3D surface WSNs targeted and pure connectivity-based solution for linearizing the networks. It is fully distributed and highly scalable, requiring a nearly constant storage and communication cost per node in the network. Extensive simulations on several representative networks demonstrate that SURF works well on high genus 3D surface WSNs.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Chen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0011:Chen", "Hongbo Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Hongbo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
