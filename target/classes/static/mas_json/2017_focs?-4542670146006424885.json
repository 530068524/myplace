It is closely connected to statistical physics and is a benchmark for satisfiability algorithms. We show that when k = \u0398(log n), any Cutting Planes refutation for random k-SAT requires exponential size in the interesting regime where the number of clauses guarantees that the formula is unsatisfiable with high probability.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Noah Fleming.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fleming:Noah", "Denis Pankratov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pankratov:Denis", "Toniann Pitassi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitassi:Toniann", "Robert Robere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robere:Robert"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
