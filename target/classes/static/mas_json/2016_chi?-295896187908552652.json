The proposed design of each magnetic sphere includes a magnetic polyhedron in the center. The magnetic polyhedron provides bi-polar magnetic fields, which are expanded in equal dihedral angles as robust features for tracking, allowing an analog Hall-sensor grid to resolve the near-surface 3D position accurately in real-time. Possible interactions between the magnetic spheres and portable physical constraints in various levels of embodiment were explored using several example applications.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Han-Chih Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Han=Chih", "Rong-Hao Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Rong=Hao", "Long-Fei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Long=Fei", "Bing-Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bing=Yu"], "pages": 5}
