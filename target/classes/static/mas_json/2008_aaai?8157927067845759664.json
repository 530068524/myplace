However, these algorithms yield projective maps which are linear combination of all the original features. The results are difficult to be interpreted psychologically and physiologically. This paper presents a novel technique for learning a sparse projection over graphs. The data in the reduced subspace is represented as a linear combination of a subset of the most relevant features. Comparing to PCA and LDA, the results obtained by sparse projection are often easier to be interpreted. Our algorithm is based on a graph embedding model, which encodes the discriminating and geometrical structure in terms of the data affinity. Once the embedding results are obtained, we then apply regularized regression for learning a set of sparse basis functions. Specifically, by using L1-norm regularizer (e.g. lasso), the sparse projections can be efficiently computed. Experimental results on two document databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Zhejiang University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Deng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Deng", "Xiaofei He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaofei", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
