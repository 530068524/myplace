{"title": "Learning Tag Embeddings and Tag-specific Composition Functions in Recursive Neural Network.", "fields": ["phrase", "deep learning", "syntax", "recurrent neural network", "recursion"], "abstract": "Recursive neural network is one of the most successful deep learning models for natural language processing due to the compositional nature of text. The model recursively composes the vector of a parent phrase from those of child words or phrases, with a key component named composition function. Although a variety of composition functions have been proposed, the syntactic information has not been fully encoded in the composition process. We propose two models, Tag Guided RNN (TGRNN for short) which chooses a composition function according to the part-ofspeech tag of a phrase, and Tag Embedded RNN/RNTN (TE-RNN/RNTN for short) which learns tag embeddings and then combines tag and word embeddings together. In the fine-grained sentiment classification, experiment results show the proposed models obtain remarkable improvement: TG-RNN/TE-RNN obtain remarkable improvement over baselines, TE-RNTN obtains the second best result among all the top performing models, and all the proposed models have much less parameters/complexity than their counterparts.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Samsung", "Samsung"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Qiao Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Qiao", "Bo Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Bo", "Minlie Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Minlie", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yang", "Xuan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xuan", "Xiaoyan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaoyan"], "pages": 10}
