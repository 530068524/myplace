{"title": "On Computing Explanations in Argumentation.", "fields": ["probabilistic argumentation", "argumentation theory", "artificial intelligence", "semantics", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Argumentation can be viewed as a process of generating explanations. However, existing argumentation semantics are developed for identifying acceptable arguments within a set, rather than giving concrete justifications for them. In this work, we propose a new argumentation semantics, related admissibility, designed for giving explanations to arguments in both Abstract Argumentation and Assumption-based Argumentation. We identify different types of explanations defined in terms of the new semantics. We also give a correct computational counterpart for explanations using dispute forests.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Xiuyi Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Xiuyi", "Francesca Toni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toni:Francesca"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
