The usability of the rendered search process and results can be increased by appropriate visualization techniques or new interaction paradigms, or both. In this article we present the HoneyComb\u2122 paradigm, an information visualization style that aims to render and manage large quantities of information items. We describe the design objectives and the prototype of HC\u2122. Finally, we present a short evaluation of the HC\u2122 paradigm in the context of search and browsing.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["National University of Ireland, Galway", "National University of Ireland, Galway"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sebastian Ryszard Kruk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kruk:Sebastian_Ryszard", "Bill McDaniel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McDaniel:Bill"], "pages": 4}
