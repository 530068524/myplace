In the uplink, there is no central node that arranges transmission schedules of all stations. To overcome this limitation, we devise a novel MAC protocol, called WLAN Opportunistic Waiver (WOW), where an access point (AP) indirectly controls transmission instants of stations by not sending a CTS frame if the received signal strength (RSS) of an RTS frame is below a certain threshold that is station- dependent. We develop an analytic model for WOW with a three- dimensional Markov chain. We can find the optimal threshold to maximize the system throughput. To avoid optimization burdens, we propose a simple algorithm which can determine a near- optimal threshold. Both analysis and ns-2 simulation results show that the throughput of WOW increases with the number of stations and the improvement compared with Receiver Based Auto Rate (RBAR) is up to 43 % while maintaining access fairness as achieved by IEEE 802.11.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Seong-il Hahm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hahm:Seong=il", "Jongwon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jongwon", "Chong-kwon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Chong=kwon"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
