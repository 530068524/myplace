{"title": "Impact of channel state information on the stability of cognitive shared channels.", "fields": ["precoding", "channel state information", "cognitive radio", "binary erasure channel", "cognitive network"], "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of calculating the stability region of a two-user cognitive shared channel where the secondary (lower priority) user, whose channel is modeled as a two-state Gilbert-Elliott channel, utilizes the channel state information to adapt its transmission probabilities accordingly. The analysis also takes into account the compound effects of multipacket reception at the receiver as well as the cooperative relaying capability of the secondary node, on the stability region of the cognitive network. Results clearly illustrate that the knowledge of the secondary channel state benefits not only the secondary user, but also the primary user as well.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["United States Naval Research Laboratory", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "Silver Spring Networks", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Sastry Kompella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kompella:Sastry", "Gam D.
