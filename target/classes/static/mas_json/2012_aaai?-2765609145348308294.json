We develop the problem formally as a stochastic optimization problem over a network cascade model describing the population spread, and present a solution approach that reduces the stochastic problem to a novel variant of a Steiner tree problem. We give a primal-dual algorithm for the problem that computes both a feasible solution and a bound on the quality of an optimal solution. Our experiments, using actual conservation data and a standard diffusion model, show that the approach produces near optimal results and is much more scalable than more generic off-the-shelf optimizers.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Shan Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Shan", "Alan Fern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fern:Alan", "Daniel Sheldon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheldon:Daniel"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
