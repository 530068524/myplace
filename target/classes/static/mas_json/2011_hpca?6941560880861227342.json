HAsim is able to model a shared-memory multicore system including detailed core pipelines, cache hierarchy, and on-chip network, using a single FPGA. We describe the scaling techniques that make this possible, including novel uses of time-multiplexing in the core pipeline and on-chip network. We compare our time-multiplexed approach to a direct implementation, and present a case study that motivates why high-detail simulations should continue to play a role in the architectural exploration process.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Intel", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Intel", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Michael Pellauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pellauer:Michael", "Michael Adler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adler:Michael", "Michel A.
