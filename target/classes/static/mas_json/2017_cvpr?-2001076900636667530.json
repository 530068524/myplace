However, several challenging issues arise in the video-based case such as self-occlusion, motion blur, and uncommon poses with few or no examples in the training data. Temporal information can provide additional cues about the location of body joints and help to alleviate these issues. In this paper, we propose a deep structured model to estimate a sequence of human poses in unconstrained videos. This model can be efficiently trained in an end-to-end manner and is capable of representing the appearance of body joints and their spatio-temporal relationships simultaneously. Domain knowledge about the human body is explicitly incorporated into the network providing effective priors to regularize the skeletal structure and to enforce temporal consistency. The proposed end-to-end architecture is evaluated on two widely used benchmarks for video-based pose estimation (Penn Action and JHMDB datasets). Our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jie Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song_0006:Jie", "Limin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Limin", "Luc Van Gool.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gool:Luc_Van", "Otmar Hilliges.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hilliges:Otmar"], "pages": 10}
