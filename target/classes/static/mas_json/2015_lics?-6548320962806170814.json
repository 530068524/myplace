The decidability of branching bisimilarity on nor med BPA was once a long-standing open problem which was closed by Yuxi Fu. The EXPTIME-hardness is an inference of a slight modification of the reduction presented by Richard Mayr. The result in this paper claims that this problem is EXPTIME-complete.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Chaodong He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Chaodong", "Mingzhang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Mingzhang"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
