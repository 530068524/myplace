A standard solution to this problem involves computing a search tree whose nodes are abstractions of zones. These abstractions preserve underlying simulation relations on the state space of the automaton. For both effectiveness and efficiency reasons, they are parameterized by the maximal lower and upper bounds (LU-bounds) occurring in the guards of the automaton. We consider the aLU abstraction defined by Behrmann et al. Since this abstraction can potentially yield non-convex sets, it has not been used in implementations. We prove that aLU abstraction is the coarsest abstraction with respect to LU-bounds that is sound and complete for reachability. We also provide an efficient technique to use the aLU abstraction to solve the reachability problem.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Bordeaux", "Chennai Mathematical Institute", "University of Bordeaux"], "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Herbreteau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herbreteau:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "B.
