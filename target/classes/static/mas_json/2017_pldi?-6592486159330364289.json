{"title": "DemoMatch: API discovery from demonstrations.", "fields": ["software framework", "database", "eclipse", "computer science", "java"], "abstract": "We introduce DemoMatch, a tool for API discovery that allows the user to discover how to implement functionality using a software framework by demonstrating the functionality in existing applications built with the same framework. DemoMatch matches the demonstrations against a database of execution traces called Semeru and generates code snippets explaining how to use the functionality. We evaluated DemoMatch on several case studies involving Java Swing and Eclipse RCP.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kuat Yessenov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yessenov:Kuat", "Ivan Kuraj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuraj:Ivan", "Armando Solar-Lezama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solar=Lezama:Armando"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2017", "pages": 15}
