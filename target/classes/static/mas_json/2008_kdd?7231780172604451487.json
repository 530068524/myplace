Pattern comparison (comparing results of the data mining process) and meta-mining are high level pattern operations that can be applied in a variety of applications, from database change management to image comparison and retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Piraeus", "University of Piraeus", "University of Piraeus", "University of Piraeus"], "authors": ["Evangelos E.
