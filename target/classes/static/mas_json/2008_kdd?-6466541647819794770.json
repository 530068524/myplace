But although these techniques  cluster  the attributes collectively, they do not  model  them collectively. For example, in citations in the research literature, canonical venue strings and title strings are dependent -- because venues tend to focus on a few research areas -- but this dependence is not modeled by current unsupervised techniques. We call this dependence between fields in a record a  cross-field dependence . In this paper, we present an unsupervised generative model for the deduplication problem that explicitly models cross-field dependence. Our model uses a single set of latent variables to control two disparate clustering models: a Dirichlet-multinomial model over titles, and a non-exchangeable string-edit model over venues. We show that modeling cross-field dependence yields a substantial improvement in performance -- a 58% reduction in error over a standard Dirichlet process mixture.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Robert Hall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hall:Robert", "Charles A.
