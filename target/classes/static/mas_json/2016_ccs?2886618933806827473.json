We will consider the numbers represented in form a-\u03c6 b where \u03c6 is the golden ratio, and in form (-1) s .2 e  where e is a fixed-point number. We develop basic arithmetic operations together with some frequently used elementary functions. All the operations are implemented and benchmarked on SHAREMIND secure multi-party computation framework. It turns out that the new proposals provide viable alternatives to standard floating- and fixed-point implementations from the performance/error viewpoint in various settings. However, the optimal choice still depends on the exact requirements of the numerical algorithm to be implemented.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "Cybernetica", "Cybernetica", "Cybernetica", "STACC, Tartu, Estonia"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Vassil Dimitrov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dimitrov:Vassil", "Liisi Kerik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kerik:Liisi", "Toomas Krips.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krips:Toomas", "Jaak Randmets.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Randmets:Jaak", "Jan Willemson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willemson:Jan"], "pages": 12}
