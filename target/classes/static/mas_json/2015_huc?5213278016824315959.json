{"title": "Beyond activity recognition: skill assessment from accelerometer data.", "fields": ["judgement", "rule induction", "activity recognition", "accelerometer", "generalization"], "abstract": "The next generation of human activity recognition applications in ubiquitous computing scenarios focuses on assessing the quality of activities, which goes beyond mere identification of activities of interest. Objective quality assessments are often difficult to achieve, hard to quantify, and typically require domain specific background information that bias the overall judgement and limit generalisation. In this paper we propose a framework for skill assessment in activity recognition that enables automatic quality analysis of human activities. Our approach is based on a hierarchical rule induction technique that effectively abstracts from noise-prone activity data and assesses activity data at different temporal contexts. Our approach requires minimal domain specific knowledge about the activities of interest, which makes it largely generalisable. By means of an extensive case study we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the context of dexterity training of 15 medical students engaging in 50 attempts of surgical activities.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "authors": ["Aftab Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Aftab", "Sebastian Mellor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mellor:Sebastian", "Eugen Berlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berlin:Eugen", "Robin Thompson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thompson:Robin", "Roisin McNaney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McNaney:Roisin", "Patrick Olivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivier:Patrick", "Thomas Pl\u00f6tz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pl=ouml=tz:Thomas"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
