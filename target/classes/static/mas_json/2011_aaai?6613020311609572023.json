Typically, the availability of patches changes over time, and recommendations must be made dynamically. This is a challenging prototypical example of a sequential optimization problem under uncertainty in computational sustainability. Existing techniques do not scale to problems of realistic size. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm for adaptively making recommendations for dynamic conservation planning, and prove that it obtains near-optimal performance. We further evaluate our approach on a detailed reserve design case study of conservation planning for three rare species in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "ETH Zurich", "North Carolina State University", "United States Geological Survey", "United States Fish and Wildlife Service"], "authors": ["Daniel Golovin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golovin:Daniel", "Andreas Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause_0001:Andreas", "Beth Gardner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gardner:Beth", "Sarah J.
