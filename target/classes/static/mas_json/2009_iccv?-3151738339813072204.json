{"title": "Robust tracking-by-detection using a detector confidence particle filter.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "object detection", "particle filter", "probabilistic logic", "ground plane"], "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for multi-person tracking-by-detection in a particle filtering framework. In addition to final high-confidence detections, our algorithm uses the continuous confidence of pedestrian detectors and online trained, instance-specific classifiers as a graded observation model. Thus, generic object category knowledge is complemented by instance-specific information. A main contribution of this paper is the exploration of how these unreliable information sources can be used for multi-person tracking. The resulting algorithm robustly tracks a large number of dynamically moving persons in complex scenes with occlusions, does not rely on background modeling, and operates entirely in 2D (requiring no camera or ground plane calibration). Our Markovian approach relies only on information from the past and is suitable for online applications. We evaluate the performance on a variety of datasets and show that it improves upon state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (604)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Michael D.
