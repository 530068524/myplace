{"title": "An Aligned Subtree Kernel for Weighted Graphs.", "fields": ["kernel embedding of distributions", "string kernel", "tree kernel", "kernel smoother", "graph kernel"], "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a new entropic matching kernel for weighted graphs by aligning depthbased representations. We demonstrate that this kernel can be seen as an aligned subtree kernel that incorporates explicit subtree correspondences, and thus addresses the drawback of neglecting the relative locations between substructures that arises in the R-convolution kernels. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that our kernel can easily outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels in terms of classification accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Central University of Finance and Economics", "University of Birmingham", "Xiamen University", "University of York"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Lu Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai_0001:Lu", "Luca Rossi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossi_0004:Luca", "Zhihong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhihong", "Edwin R.
