In this paper, we propose a classification of direct and indirect physiological sensor input to  augment  traditional game control. To find out which sensors work best for which game mechanics, we conducted a mixed-methods study using different sensor mappings. Our results show participants have a preference for direct physiological control in games. This has two major design implications for physiologically controlled games: (1) Direct physiological sensors should be mapped intuitively to reflect an action in the virtual world; (2) Indirect physiological input is best used as a dramatic device in games to influence features altering the game world.", "citation": "Citations (181)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Lennart E.
