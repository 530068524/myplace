In this paper, we propose an interactive object annotation method that incrementally trains an object detector while the user provides annotations. In the design of the system, we have focused on minimizing human annotation time rather than pure algorithm learning performance. To this end, we optimize the detector based on a realistic annotation cost model based on a user study. Since our system gives live feedback to the user by detecting objects on the fly and predicts the potential annotation costs of unseen images, data can be efficiently annotated by a single user without excessive waiting time. In contrast to popular tracking-based methods for video annotation, our method is suitable for both still images and video. We have evaluated our interactive annotation approach on three datasets, ranging from surveillance, television, to cell microscopy.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Angela Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Angela", "Juergen Gall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gall:Juergen", "Christian Leistner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leistner:Christian", "Luc J.
