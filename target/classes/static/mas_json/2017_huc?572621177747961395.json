My research builds an understanding patient and provider needs and challenges to advance the design of personal informatics systems and theoretical understandings of patient-provider collaboration. Through studies of patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome and people who want to eat healthier, I study people's current tracking experiences and their collaborative review practices with providers. Based on these findings, I propose design and theoretical considerations regarding interactions among providers, patients, and patient-tracked data. I design and evaluate systems in situ to understand potential use of lightweight data collection and integration to support collaboration around personal informatics data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Washington"], "authors": ["Chia-Fang Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Chia=Fang"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
