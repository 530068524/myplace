{"title": "Generalized Correspondence-LDA Models (GC-LDA) for Identifying Functional Regions in the Brain.", "fields": ["data type", "machine learning", "missing data", "cognition", "probability distribution"], "abstract": "This paper presents Generalized Correspondence-LDA (GC-LDA), a generalization of the Correspondence-LDA model that allows for variable spatial representations to be associated with topics, and increased flexibility in terms of the strength of the correspondence between data types induced by the model. We present three variants of GC-LDA, each of which associates topics with a different spatial representation, and apply them to a corpus of neuroimaging data. In the context of this dataset, each topic corresponds to a functional brain region, where the region's spatial extent is captured by a probability distribution over neural activity, and the region's cognitive function is captured by a probability distribution over linguistic terms. We illustrate the qualitative improvements offered by GC-LDA in terms of the types of topics extracted with alternative spatial representations, as well as the model's ability to incorporate a-priori knowledge from the neuroimaging literature. We furthermore demonstrate that the novel features of GC-LDA improve predictions for missing data.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Indiana University Bloomington", "University of Texas at Austin", "SurveyMonkey"], "authors": ["Timothy N.
