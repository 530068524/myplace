When the agent number increases largely, the learning becomes intractable due to the curse of the dimensionality and the exponential growth of user interactions. In this paper, we present Mean Field Reinforcement Learning where the interactions within the population of agents are approximated by those between a single agent and the average effect from the overall population or neighboring agents; the interplay between the two entities is mutually reinforced: the learning of the individual agent's optimal policy depends on the dynamics of the population, while the dynamics of the population change according to the collective patterns of the individual policies. We develop practical mean field Q-learning and mean field Actor-Critic algorithms and analyze the convergence of the solution. Experiments on resource allocation, Ising model estimation, and battle game tasks verify the learning effectiveness of our mean field approaches in handling many-agent interactions in population.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Yaodong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yaodong", "Rui Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Rui", "Minne Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Minne", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Ming", "Weinan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Weinan", "Jun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jun"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
