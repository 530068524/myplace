Existing methods for solving the multi-camera relative pose problem require extra correspondences, are slow to compute, and/or produce a multitude of solutions. Our solution uses a first-order approximation to relative pose in order to simplify the problem and produce an accurate estimate quickly. The solver is applicable to sequential multi-camera motion estimation and is fast enough for real-time implementation in a random sampling framework. Our experiments show that our approach is both stable and efficient on challenging test sequences.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Colorado Colorado Springs", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jonathan Ventura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Ventura:Jonathan", "Clemens Arth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arth:Clemens", "Vincent Lepetit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepetit:Vincent"], "pages": 9}
