We show that this output structure is equivalent to a finite quasi-ultrametric space and study admissibility with respect to two desirable properties. We prove that a modified version of single linkage is the only admissible quasi-clustering method. Moreover, we show stability of the proposed method and we establish invariance properties fulfilled by it. Algorithms are further developed and the value of quasi-clustering analysis is illustrated with a study of internal migration within United States.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Ohio State University", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Gunnar E.
