{"title": "Computer-Aided Security Proofs for the Working Cryptographer.", "fields": ["elgamal encryption", "automated proof checking", "cramer shoup cryptosystem", "proof assistant", "computer assisted proof"], "abstract": "We present EasyCrypt, an automated tool for elaborating security proofs of cryptographic systems from proof sketches-compact, formal representations of the essence of a proof as a sequence of games and hints. Proof sketches are checked automatically using off-the-shelf SMT solvers and automated theorem provers, and then compiled into verifiable proofs in the CertiCrypt framework. The tool supports most common reasoning patterns and is significantly easier to use than its predecessors. We argue that EasyCrypt is a plausible candidate for adoption by working cryptographers and illustrate its application to security proofs of the Cramer-Shoup and Hashed ElGamal cryptosystems.", "citation": "Citations (189)", "departments": ["IMDEA", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "IMDEA"], "authors": ["Gilles Barthe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthe:Gilles", "Benjamin Gr\u00e9goire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=eacute=goire:Benjamin", "Sylvain Heraud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heraud:Sylvain", "Santiago Zanella B\u00e9guelin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=eacute=guelin:Santiago_Zanella"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2011", "pages": 20}
