{"title": "Selective Sharing for Multilingual Dependency Parsing.", "fields": ["parsing", "third generation programming language", "dependency grammar", "ontology language", "second generation programming language"], "abstract": "We present a novel algorithm for multilingual dependency parsing that uses annotations from a diverse set of source languages to parse a new unannotated language. Our motivation is to broaden the advantages of multilingual learning to languages that exhibit significant differences from existing resource-rich languages. The algorithm learns which aspects of the source languages are relevant for the target language and ties model parameters accordingly. The model factorizes the process of generating a dependency tree into two steps: selection of syntactic dependents and their ordering. Being largely language-universal, the selection component is learned in a supervised fashion from all the training languages. In contrast, the ordering decisions are only influenced by languages with similar properties. We systematically model this cross-lingual sharing using typological features. In our experiments, the model consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art multi-lingual parser. The largest improvement is achieved on the non Indo-European languages yielding a gain of 14.4%.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Tahira Naseem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naseem:Tahira", "Regina Barzilay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barzilay:Regina", "Amir Globerson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Globerson:Amir"], "pages": 9}
