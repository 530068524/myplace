{"title": "On the Complexity of Global Scheduling Constraints under Structural Restrictions.", "fields": ["scheduling", "mathematical optimization", "computer science", "computational complexity theory", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "We investigate the computational complexity of two global constraints, CUMULATIVE and INTERDISTANCE. These are key constraints in modeling and solving scheduling problems. Enforcing domain consistency on both is NP-hard. However, restricted versions of these constraints are often sufficient in practice. Some examples include scheduling problems with a large number of similar tasks, or tasks sparsely distributed over time. Another example is runway sequencing problems in air-traffic control, where landing periods have a regular pattern. Such cases can be characterized in terms of structural restrictions on the constraints. We identify a number of such structural restrictions and investigate how they impact the computational complexity of propagating these global constraints. In particular, we prove that such restrictions often make propagation tractable.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "NICTA", "NICTA", "University of Melbourne", "NICTA"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Geoffrey Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Geoffrey", "Serge Gaspers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaspers:Serge", "Nina Narodytska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narodytska:Nina", "Andreas Schutt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schutt:Andreas", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "pages": 7}
