Our main technical result gives the precise distribution of the magnitude of the projection of the data onto a given subspace, and enables us to develop inference procedures for a broad class of group-sparse selection methods, including the group lasso, iterative hard thresholding, and forward stepwise regression. We give numerical results to illustrate these tools on simulated data and on health record data.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "Microsoft", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Fan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Fan", "Rina Foygel Barber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barber:Rina_Foygel", "Prateek Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0002:Prateek", "John D.
