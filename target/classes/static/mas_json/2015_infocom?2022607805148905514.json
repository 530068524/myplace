These DBA algorithms use packet delay as an important quality of service (QoS) metric. This has led to a significant interest in developing mathematical models for analyzing the delay. These delay models often provide valuable qualitative results and worthwhile insights in understanding the mechanism of the delay and the manner in which it depends upon algorithm characteristics. Up to now, the delay models have been developed under some approximations, e.g., fixed packet sizes, negligible distances between a server and its users, a gated bandwidth assignment method, and Poisson traffic. In this paper, we develop the delay models for more realistic scenarios than the current state-of-the-art, including gated and limited bandwidth assignment methods, Poisson and Pareto traffic, and long-reach PONs in which the distance between the server and the users is significant and hence not negligible. We model different DBA paradigms, such as REPORT after data, REPORT before data, and multi-thread polling. The results from simulation experiments confirm the accuracy of the delay models.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University"], "authors": ["Abhishek Dixit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dixit:Abhishek", "Bart Lannoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lannoo:Bart", "Didier Colle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colle:Didier", "Mario Pickavet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pickavet:Mario", "Piet Demeester.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demeester:Piet"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
