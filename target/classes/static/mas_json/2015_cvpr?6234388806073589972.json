Typically, it is assumed that the to-be-fused heterogeneous features work well by themselves for the query. However, in a more realistic situation, one does not know in advance whether a feature is effective or not for a given query. As a result, it is of great importance to identify feature effectiveness in a query-adaptive manner.", "citation": "Citations (198)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Liang Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0001:Liang", "Shengjin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shengjin", "Lu Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Lu", "Fei He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Fei", "Ziqiong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ziqiong", "Qi Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Qi"], "pages": 10}
