Results indicate that improved web forms lead to faster completion times, fewer form submission trials, and fewer eye movements. Data from subjective questionnaires and interviews further show increased user satisfaction. Overall, our findings highlight the importance for web designers to improve their web forms using UX guidelines.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Basel", "University of Basel", "Google", "University of Basel", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mirjam Seckler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seckler:Mirjam", "Silvia Heinz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinz:Silvia", "Javier A.
