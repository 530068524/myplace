Temporal regularization in video is challenging because both the camera and the scene may be in motion. Thus Euclidean distance in the space-time volume is not a good proxy for correspondence. We optimize the mapping of pixels to a Euclidean feature space so as to minimize distances between corresponding points. Structured prediction is performed by a dense CRF that operates on the optimized features. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented approach increases the accuracy and temporal consistency of semantic video segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "Intel"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Abhijit Kundu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kundu:Abhijit", "Vibhav Vineet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vineet:Vibhav", "Vladlen Koltun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koltun:Vladlen"], "pages": 8}
