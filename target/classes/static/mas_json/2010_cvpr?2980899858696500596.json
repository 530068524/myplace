{"title": "Pushing the envelope of modern methods for bundle adjustment.", "fields": ["bundle adjustment", "3d reconstruction", "conjugate gradient method", "bundle", "pixel", "sparse matrix", "iterative reconstruction"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present results and experiments with several methods for bundle adjustment, producing the fastest bundle adjuster ever published. The fastest methods work with the well known reduced camera system and handle the block-sparse pattern arising in the reduced camera system in a natural way. Adapting to the naturally arising block-sparsity allows the use of BLAS3, efficient memory handling, fast variable ordering, and customized sparse solving all at the same time. We present two methods, one using exact minimum degree ordering and block-based LDL solving, and one using block-based preconditioned conjugate gradient, both on the reduced camera system. We show experimentally that the adaptation to the natural block sparsity allows both these methods to perform better than previous ones. Further speed improvements are achieved by the novel use of embedded point iterations. The embedded point iterations take place inside each camera update step, yielding a higher cost decrease from each camera update step. This is especially true for points projecting far out on the flatter region of the robustifier.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["KAIST", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "KAIST", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "KAIST"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yekeun Jeong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeong:Yekeun", "David Nist\u00e9r.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nist=eacute=r:David", "Drew Steedly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steedly:Drew", "Richard Szeliski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szeliski:Richard", "In-So Kweon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kweon:In=So"], "pages": 8}
