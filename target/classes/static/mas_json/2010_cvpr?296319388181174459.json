If the sampling times of multiple cameras are different from each other, there is no corresponding point in the images of moving points and we cannot calibrate these cameras. In this paper we analyze geometric relationships of multiple cameras in the frequency space, and show that they enable us to calibrate multiple unsynchronized cameras accurately even if exact corresponding points do not exist in images. The proposed method does not require any interpolation of moving points in images.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hiroki Matsumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsumoto:Hiroki", "Jun Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Jun", "Fumihiko Sakaue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakaue:Fumihiko"], "pages": 8}
