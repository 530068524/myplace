The motivation for MIRank stems from the hydrogen abstraction problem in computational chemistry, that of predicting the group of hydrogen atoms from which a hydrogen is abstracted (removed) during metabolism. The model predicts the preferred hydrogen group within a molecule by ranking the groups, with the ambiguity of not knowing which hydrogen atom within the preferred group is actually abstracted. This paper formulates MIRank in its general context and proposes an algorithm for solving MIRank problems using successive linear programming. The method outperforms multiple instance classification models on several real and synthetic datasets.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Charles Bergeron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergeron:Charles", "Jed Zaretzki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaretzki:Jed", "Curt M.
