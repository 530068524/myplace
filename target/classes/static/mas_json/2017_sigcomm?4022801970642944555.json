{"title": "Constant Time Updates in Hierarchical Heavy Hitters.", "fields": ["network packet", "probabilistic logic", "prefix", "denial of service attack", "overhead"], "abstract": "Monitoring tasks, such as anomaly and DDoS detection, require identifying frequent flow aggregates based on common IP prefixes. These are known as hierarchical heavy hitters (HHH), where the hierarchy is determined based on the type of prefixes of interest in a given application. The per packet complexity of existing HHH algorithms is proportional to the size of the hierarchy, imposing significant overheads.   In this paper, we propose a randomized constant time algorithm for HHH. We prove probabilistic precision bounds backed by an empirical evaluation. Using four real Internet packet traces, we demonstrate that our algorithm indeed obtains comparable accuracy and recall as previous works, while running up to 62 times faster. Finally, we extended Open vSwitch (OVS) with our algorithm and showed it is able to handle 13.8 million packets per second. In contrast, incorporating previous works in OVS only obtained 2.5 times lower throughput.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Bell Labs", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul", "Bell Labs"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Ran Ben-Basat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Basat:Ran", "Gil Einziger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Einziger:Gil", "Roy Friedman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedman:Roy", "Marcelo Caggiani Luizelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luizelli:Marcelo_Caggiani", "Erez Waisbard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waisbard:Erez"], "pages": 14}
