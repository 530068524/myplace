We show that the local velocity vectors at each instant of the trajectory are an effective basis for motion segmentation. We decompose the velocity profiles of point tracks into different motion components and corresponding non-negative weights using non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF). We then segment the different motions using spectral clustering on the derived weights. We test our algorithm on the Hopkins 155 benchmarking database and several new sequences, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm can accurately segment multiple motions at a speed of a few seconds per frame. We show that our algorithm is particularly successful on low-level tracks from real-world video that are fragmented, noisy and inaccurate.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Anil M.
