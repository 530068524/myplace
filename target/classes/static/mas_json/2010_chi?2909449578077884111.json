In particular, we resolve the location of finger taps on the arm and hand by analyzing mechanical vibrations that propagate through the body. We collect these signals using a novel array of sensors worn as an armband. This approach provides an always available, naturally portable, and on-body finger input system. We assess the capabilities, accuracy and limitations of our technique through a two-part, twenty-participant user study. To further illustrate the utility of our approach, we conclude with several proof-of-concept applications we developed.", "citation": "Citations (532)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Chris Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Chris", "Desney S.
