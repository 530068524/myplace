{"title": "Augmented reality flavors: gustatory display based on edible marker and cross-modal interaction.", "fields": ["exploratory research", "augmented reality", "sensation", "scarcity", "olfaction"], "abstract": "The main contribution of this paper is to realize computer generated augmented flavors and establish a method to integrate gustatory information into computer human interactions. There are several reasons for the scarcity of research on gustatory information. One reason is that taste sensations are affected by a number of factors, such as vision, olfaction and memories. This produces a complex cognition mechanism for a user's gustatory sensation, and makes it difficult to build up a gustatory display which produces a specific taste on demand.   Our hypothesis is that the complexity of gustatory sensation can be applied to the realization of a \"Pseudo-gustatory\" display that presents the desired flavors by means of a cross-modal effect elicited by visual and olfactory augmented reality. We propose the Edible Marker system, which can detect the state [number/shape/6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) coordinate] of each piece of bitten or divided food in real time, and the \"Pseudo-gustation\" method to change the perceived taste of food by changing its appearance and scent. We construct \"MetaCookie+\" as an implementation and discuss its validity through an exploratory study.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Takuji Narumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narumi:Takuji", "Shinya Nishizaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishizaka:Shinya", "Takashi Kajinami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kajinami:Takashi", "Tomohiro Tanikawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanikawa:Tomohiro", "Michitaka Hirose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirose:Michitaka"], "pages": 10}
