{"title": "Providing bandwidth guarantees, work conservation and low latency simultaneously in the cloud.", "fields": ["cloud computing", "bandwidth", "testbed", "dynamic bandwidth allocation", "low latency"], "abstract": "Today's cloud is shared among multiple tenants running different applications, and a desirable multi-tenant datacenter network infrastructure should provide bandwidth guarantees for throughput-intensive applications, low latency for latency-sensitive short messages, as well as work conservation to fully utilize the network bandwidth. Despite significant efforts in recent years, none of them can achieve these three properties simultaneously. In this paper, we identify the key deficiency of prior solutions and use this insight to motivate our design of Trinity \u2014 a simple, practical yet effective solution that achieves bandwidth guarantees, work conservation and low latency simultaneously in the cloud. We implement Trinity using existing commodity hardwares and demonstrate its superior performance over prior solutions using testbed experiments.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Nanjing University", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Shuihai Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Shuihai", "Wei Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai_0001:Wei", "Kai Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0005:Kai", "Chen Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Chen", "Ying Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ying", "Haitao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Haitao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
