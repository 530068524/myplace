{"title": "The \"Beauty Dilemma\": beauty is valued but discounted in product choice.", "fields": ["user experience design", "usability", "dilemma", "beauty", "spurious relationship"], "abstract": "The empirical study of aesthetics in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is concerned with - among other topics - the relationship between beauty and usability and the general impact of beauty on product choice and use. Specifically, the present paper explores the notion of a \"beauty dilemma\" - the idea that people discount beauty in a choice situation, although they value it in general (i.e., they are not choosing what makes them happy). We explored this idea in three studies with a total of over 600 participants. Study 1 revealed a reluctance to pay for beauty due to its hedonic nature (i.e., associated with luxury etc.). Study 2 showed that people prefer a more beautiful product, but justify their choice by referring to spurious advantages in usability. Finally, Study 3 revealed that a choice situation which requires a trade-off between beauty and usability, and which offers no further way to justify choosing beauty, leads to a sharp increase in the preference of usability. The underlying reasons for this \"beauty dilemma\" and further implications are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["University of Koblenz and Landau", "University of Siegen"], "authors": ["Sarah Diefenbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diefenbach:Sarah", "Marc Hassenzahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassenzahl:Marc"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
