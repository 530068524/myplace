Although this has been found highly useful globally, its effect on different queries may vary. In this paper, we examine the impact of query suggestion on queries of different degrees of difficulty. It turns out that query suggestion is much more useful for difficult queries than easy queries. In addition, the suggestions for difficult queries should rely less on their similarity to the original query. In this paper, we use a learning-to-rank approach to select query suggestions, based on several types of features including a query performance prediction. As query suggestion has different impacts on different queries, we propose an adaptive suggestion approach that makes suggestions only for difficult queries. We carry out experiments on real data from a search engine. Our results clearly indicate that an approach targeting difficult queries can bring higher gain than a uniform suggestion approach.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yang", "Ruihua Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Ruihua", "Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yu", "Jian-Yun Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Jian=Yun", "Ji-Rong Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Ji=Rong"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
