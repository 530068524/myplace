This suite has been designed to use patterns of collaboration to support therapists in their use of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). In this paper, we discuss the observations collected during a field study where two therapists used the system for social competence training sessions with 8 children. We conclude with lessons learned from meshing software enhanced collaboration within the CBT model.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Haifa", "University of Haifa", "FBK, Trento, Italy", "FBK, Trento, Italy"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Leonardo Giusti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giusti:Leonardo", "Massimo Zancanaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zancanaro:Massimo", "Eynat Gal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gal:Eynat", "Patrice L.
