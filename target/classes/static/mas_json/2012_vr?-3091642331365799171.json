To render the augmented surfaces interactive, we may exploit directly existing computer vision techniques. However, when using video projection to alter directly the appearance of surfaces, most vision-based algorithms fail. Even Wear Ur World [5], a recent and otherwise well-received interactive projector-camera system, relies on colored thimbles as markers. As notable exception, Tele-Graffiti [6] was designed for normal visible-light cameras without markers, but still considers the light emitted from the projector as unwanted interference, limiting its application.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Samuel Audet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Audet:Samuel", "Masatoshi Okutomi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okutomi:Masatoshi", "Masayuki Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka_0001:Masayuki"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
