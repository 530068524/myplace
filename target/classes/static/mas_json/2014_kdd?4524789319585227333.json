{"title": "FAST-PPR: scaling personalized pagerank estimation for large graphs.", "fields": ["approximation error", "social search", "pagerank", "speedup", "directed graph"], "abstract": "We propose a new algorithm, FAST-PPR, for computing personalized PageRank: given start node  s  and target node  t  in a directed graph, and given a threshold \u03b4, it computes the Personalized PageRank \u03c0_s(t) from  s  to  t , guaranteeing that the relative error is small as long \u03c0  s  ( t ) > \u03b4. Existing algorithms for this problem have a running-time of \u03a9(1/\u03b4 in comparison, FAST-PPR has a provable average running-time guarantee of  O (\u221a d /\u03b4) (where  d  is the average in-degree of the graph). This is a significant improvement, since \u03b4 is often  O (1/ n ) (where  n  is the number of nodes) for applications. We also complement the algorithm with an \u03a9(1/\u221a\u03b4) lower bound for PageRank estimation, showing that the dependence on \u03b4 cannot be improved.   We perform a detailed empirical study on numerous massive graphs, showing that FAST-PPR dramatically outperforms existing algorithms. For example, on the 2010 Twitter graph with 1.5 billion edges, for target nodes sampled by popularity, FAST-PPR has a 20 factor speedup over the state of the art. Furthermore, an enhanced version of FAST-PPR has a 160 factor speedup on the Twitter graph, and is at least 20 times faster on all our candidate graphs.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Sandia National Laboratories"], "authors": ["Peter Lofgren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lofgren:Peter", "Siddhartha Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Siddhartha", "Ashish Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Ashish", "Seshadhri Comandur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Comandur:Seshadhri"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
