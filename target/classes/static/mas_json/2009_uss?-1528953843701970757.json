{"title": "xBook: Redesigning Privacy Control in Social Networking Platforms.", "fields": ["service provider", "information flow", "social network", "private information retrieval", "usability"], "abstract": "Social networking websites have recently evolved from being service providers to platforms for running third party applications. Users have typically trusted the social networking sites with personal data, and assume that their privacy preferences are correctly enforced. However, they are now being asked to trust each third-party application they use in a similar manner. This has left the users' private information vulnerable to accidental or malicious leaks by these applications.\n\nIn this work, we present a novel framework for building privacy-preserving social networking applications that retains the functionality offered by the current social networks. We use information flow models to control what untrusted applications can do with the information they receive. We show the viability of our design by means of a platform prototype. The usability of the platform is further evaluated by developing sample applications using the platform APIs. We also discuss both security and nonsecurity challenges in designing and implementing such a framework.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Google", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Kapil Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Kapil", "Sumeer Bhola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhola:Sumeer", "Wenke Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wenke"], "pages": 18}
