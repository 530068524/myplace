In this paper, we present our exploratory investigation of utilizing wireless transmissions in DCNs. Our work aims to solve the congestion problem caused by a few hot nodes to improve the global performance. We model the wireless transmissions in a DCN by considering both the wireless interference and the adaptive transmission rate. Moreover, both throughput and job completion time are taken into account to evaluate the impact of wireless transmissions on the global performance. Based on this model, we formulate the channel allocation in wireless DCNs as an optimization problem and design a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to address it. To demonstrate the effectiveness of wireless transmissions as well as our GA-based algorithm in a wireless DCN, extensive simulation study is carried out and the results validate our design.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "George Washington University"], "authors": ["Yong Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui_0001:Yong", "Hongyi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hongyi", "Xiuzhen Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiuzhen"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
