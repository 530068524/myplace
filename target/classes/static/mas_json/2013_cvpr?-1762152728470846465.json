{"title": "Robust Multi-resolution Pedestrian Detection in Traffic Scenes.", "fields": ["context model", "pedestrian detection", "bottleneck", "coordinate descent", "multi task learning"], "abstract": "The serious performance decline with decreasing resolution is the major bottleneck for current pedestrian detection techniques. In this paper, we take pedestrian detection in different resolutions as different but related problems, and propose a Multi-Task model to jointly consider their commonness and differences. The model contains resolution aware transformations to map pedestrians in different resolutions to a common space, where a shared detector is constructed to distinguish pedestrians from background. For model learning, we present a coordinate descent procedure to learn the resolution aware transformations and deformable part model (DPM) based detector iteratively. In traffic scenes, there are many false positives located around vehicles, therefore, we further build a context model to suppress them according to the pedestrian-vehicle relationship. The context model can be learned automatically even when the vehicle annotations are not available. Our method reduces the mean miss rate to 60% for pedestrians taller than 30 pixels on the Caltech Pedestrian Benchmark, which noticeably outperforms previous state-of-the-art (71%).", "citation": "Citations (154)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Nat.
