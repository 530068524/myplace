{"title": "Fast and Provably Good Seedings for k-Means.", "fields": ["data set", "k means clustering", "markov chain monte carlo", "seeding", "orders of magnitude"], "abstract": "Seeding - the task of finding initial cluster centers - is critical in obtaining high-quality clusterings for k-Means. However, k-means++ seeding, the state of the art algorithm, does not scale well to massive datasets as it is inherently sequential and requires k full passes through the data. It was recently shown that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can be used to efficiently approximate the seeding step of k-means++. However, this result requires assumptions on the data generating distribution. We propose a simple yet fast seeding algorithm that produces *provably* good clusterings even *without assumptions* on the data. Our analysis shows that the algorithm allows for a favourable trade-off between solution quality and computational cost, speeding up k-means++ seeding by up to several orders of magnitude. We validate our theoretical results in extensive experiments on a variety of real-world data sets.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Olivier Bachem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bachem:Olivier", "Mario Lucic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucic:Mario", "Seyed Hamed Hassani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassani:Seyed_Hamed", "Andreas Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause_0001:Andreas"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
