It can help the on-line review websites to relieve the damage of spammers in time, but has never been investigated by previous work. This paper proposes a novel neural network model to detect review spam for the cold-start problem, by learning to represent the new reviewers\u2019 review with jointly embedded textual and behavioral information. Experimental results prove the proposed model achieves an effective performance and possesses preferable domain-adaptability. It is also applicable to a large-scale dataset in an unsupervised way.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xuepeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xuepeng", "Kang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Kang", "Jun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Jun"], "pages": 11}
