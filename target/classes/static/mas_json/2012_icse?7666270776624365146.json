{"title": "Co-adapting human collaborations and software architectures.", "fields": ["collaborative software", "software architecture", "knowledge sharing", "software maintenance", "context awareness"], "abstract": "Human collaboration has become an integral part of large-scale systems for massive online knowledge sharing, content distribution, and social networking. Maintenance of these complex systems, however, still relies on adaptation mechanisms that remain unaware of the prevailing user collaboration patterns. Consequently, a system cannot react to changes in the interaction behavior thereby impeding the collaboration's evolution. In this paper, we make the case for a human architecture model and its mapping onto software architecture elements as fundamental building blocks for system adaptation.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Christoph Dorn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dorn:Christoph", "Richard N.
