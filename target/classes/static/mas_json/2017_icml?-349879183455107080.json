Players perform steps on a dance platform in synchronization with music as directed by on-screen step charts. While many step charts are available in standardized packs, players may grow tired of existing charts, or wish to dance to a song for which no chart exists. We introduce the task of learning to choreograph. Given a raw audio track, the goal is to produce a new step chart. This task decomposes naturally into two subtasks: deciding when to place steps and deciding which steps to select. For the step placement task, we combine recurrent and convolutional neural networks to ingest spectrograms of low-level audio features to predict steps, conditioned on chart difficulty. For step selection, we present a conditional LSTM generative model that substantially outperforms n-gram and fixed-window approaches.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Chris Donahue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Donahue:Chris", "Zachary C.
