{"title": "Evidence-Specific Structures for Rich Tractable CRFs.", "fields": ["conditional random field", "crfs", "discriminative model", "speedup", "order of magnitude"], "abstract": "We present a simple and effective approach to learning tractable conditional random fields with structure that depends on the evidence. Our approach retains the advantages of tractable discriminative models, namely efficient exact inference and arbitrarily accurate parameter learning in polynomial time. At the same time, our algorithm does not suffer a large expressive power penalty inherent to fixed tractable structures. On real-life relational datasets, our approach matches or exceeds state of the art accuracy of the dense models, and at the same time provides an order of magnitude speedup.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Anton Chechetka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechetka:Anton", "Carlos Guestrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guestrin:Carlos"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
