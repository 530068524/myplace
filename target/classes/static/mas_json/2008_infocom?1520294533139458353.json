The proposed protocol is characterized by the generation of on-the-fly short-time anonymous keys between on-board units (OBUs) and roadside units (RSUs), which can provide fast anonymous authentication and privacy tracking while minimizing the required storage for short-time anonymous keys. We demonstrate the merits gained by the proposed protocol through extensive analysis.", "citation": "Citations (551)", "departments": ["Dept. of Electr ... y, Waterloo, ON", "Dept. of Electr ... y, Waterloo, ON", "Dept. of Electr ... y, Waterloo, ON", "Dept. of Electr ... y, Waterloo, ON", "Dept. of Electr ... y, Waterloo, ON"], "authors": ["Rongxing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Rongxing", "Xiaodong Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xiaodong", "Haojin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Haojin", "Pin-Han Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Pin=Han", "Xuemin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xuemin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
