In this paper, we focus on the problem of performing multi-label classification on networked data, where the instances in the network can be assigned multiple labels. In contrast to traditional content-only classification methods, relational learning succeeds in improving classification performance by leveraging the correlation of the labels between linked instances. However, instances in a network can be linked for various causal reasons, hence treating all links in a homogeneous way can limit the performance of relational classifiers.   In this paper, we propose a multi-label iterative relational neighbor classifier that employs social context features (SCRN). Our classifier incorporates a class propagation probability distribution obtained from instances' social features, which are in turn extracted from the network topology. This class-propagation probability captures the node's intrinsic likelihood of belonging to each class, and serves as a prior weight for each class when aggregating the neighbors' class labels in the collective inference procedure. Experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed classifier boosts classification performance over common benchmarks on networked multi-label data.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "authors": ["Xi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xi", "Gita Sukthankar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sukthankar:Gita"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
