Given a balanced bipartite graph G with edge costs, the \"assignment problem\" asks for a perfect matching in G of minimum total cost. The Hungarian Method can solve assignment problems in time O(mn + n^2 log n), where n := |X| = |Y| and m := |E|. If the edge weights are integers bounded in magnitude by C > 1, then algorithms using \"weight scaling\", such as that of Gabow and Tarjan, can lower the time to O(m sqrt(n) log(nC)). There are important applications in which G is \"unbalanced\", with |X| not equal |Y|, and we require a min-cost matching of size r := min(|X|, |Y|) or, more generally, of some specified size s than or equal to r. The Hungarian Method extends easily to find such a matching in time O(ms + s2 log r), but weightscaling algorithms do not extend so easily. We introduce new machinery to find such a matching in time O(mps log(sC)) via weight scaling. Our results provide some insight into the design space of efficient weight-scaling matching algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Princeton University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Lyle Ramshaw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramshaw:Lyle", "Robert Endre Tarjan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarjan:Robert_Endre"], "pages": 10}
