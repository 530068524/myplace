Recent proposals on multitasking GPUs have focused on either spatial multitasking, which partitions GPU resource at a streaming multiprocessor (SM) granularity, or simultaneous multikernel (SMK), which runs multiple kernels on the same SM. However, multitasking performance varies heavily depending on the resource partitions within each scheme, and the application mixes. In this paper, we propose GPU Maestro that performs dynamic resource management for efficient utilization of multitasking GPUs. GPU Maestro can discover the best performing GPU resource partition exploiting both spatial multitasking and SMK. Furthermore, dynamism within a kernel and interference between the kernels are automatically considered because GPU Maestro finds the best performing partition through direct measurements. Evaluations show that GPU Maestro can improve average system throughput by 20.2% and 13.9% over the baseline spatial multitasking and SMK, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Hongik University", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Jason Jong Kyu Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jason_Jong_Kyu", "Yongjun Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Yongjun", "Scott A.
