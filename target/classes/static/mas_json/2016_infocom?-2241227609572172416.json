Multicast of videos to a set of heterogeneous users over multiple wireless access points, however, is challenging because of the trade-offs between high transmission rate, load balancing, and multicast opportunities. In this paper, we present JurCast, a joint user and rate allocation scheme for video multicast over multiple APs. Our approach balances the trade-off between these factors by determining user to Access Points (APs) association, the video resolution version (quality) to be delivered for each session, and the transmission link rate for each video version. The aim of our solution is to maximize the overall received video quality over all users. We have implemented and evaluated our solution on a WiFi testbed as well as the simulation of a large scale deployment. The results indicate that our method considerably outperforms the baseline schemes and achieves up to 3dB and 55% improvements in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and goodput, respectively.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Hui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hui", "Wei Tsang Ooi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ooi:Wei_Tsang", "Mun Choon Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Mun_Choon"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
