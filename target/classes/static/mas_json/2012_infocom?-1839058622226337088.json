In this work, we study a joint tenant (e.g., server or virtual machine) placement and routing problem to minimize traffic costs. These two complementary degrees of freedom\u2014placement and routing\u2014are mutually-dependent, however, are often optimized separately in today's data centers. Leveraging and expanding the technique of Markov approximation, we propose an efficient online algorithm in a dynamic environment under changing traffic loads. The algorithm requires a very small number of virtual machine migrations and is easy to implement in practice. Performance evaluation that employs the real data center traffic traces under a spectrum of elephant and mice flows, demonstrates a consistent and significant improvement over the benchmark achieved by common heuristics.", "citation": "Citations (313)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "George Washington University", "Princeton University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Joe Wenjie Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Joe_Wenjie", "Tian Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Tian", "Sangtae Ha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ha:Sangtae", "Minghua Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Minghua", "Mung Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang:Mung"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
