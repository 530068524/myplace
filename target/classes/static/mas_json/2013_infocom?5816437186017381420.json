Mobile nodes in MSNs generally visit community homes frequently, while other locations are visited less frequently. We propose a novel zero-knowledge MSN routing algorithm, homing spread (HS). The community homes have a higher priority to spread messages into the network. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm can spread a given number of message copies in an optimal way when the inter-meeting times between any two nodes and between a node and a community home follow exponential distributions. We also calculate the expected delivery delay of HS. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted. Results show that community homes are important factors in efficient message spreading. By using homes to spread messages faster, HS achieves a better performance than existing zero-knowledge MSN routing algorithms, including Epidemic, with a given number of copies, and Spray&Wait.", "citation": "Citations (137)", "departments": ["Temple University", "Temple University", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Jie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Jie", "Mingjun Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Mingjun", "Liusheng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Liusheng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
