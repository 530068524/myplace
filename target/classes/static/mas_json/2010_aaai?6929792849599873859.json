{"title": "Collaborative Filtering Meets Mobile Recommendation: A User-Centered Approach.", "fields": ["global positioning system", "machine learning", "mobile broadband", "collaborative filtering", "popularity"], "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of location tracking services such as GPS, more and more mobile data are being accumulated. Based on such data, a potentially useful service is to make timely and targeted recommendations for users on places where they might be interested to go and activities that they are likely to conduct. For example, a user arriving in Beijing might wonder where to visit and what she can do around the Forbidden City. A key challenge for such recommendation problems is that the data we have on each individual user might be very limited, while to make useful and accurate recommendations, we need extensive annotated location and activity information from user trace data. In this paper, we present a new approach, known as user-centered collaborative location and activity filtering (UCLAF), to pull many users' data together and apply collaborative filtering to find like-minded users and like-patterned activities at different locations. We model the user-location-activity relations with a tensor representation, and propose a regularized tensor and matrix decomposition solution which can better address the sparse data problem in mobile information retrieval. We empirically evaluate UCLAF using a real-world GPS dataset collected from 164 users over 2.5 years, and showed that our system can outperform several state-of-the-art solutions to the problem.", "citation": "Citations (278)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Vincent Wenchen Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Vincent_Wenchen", "Bin Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao_0001:Bin", "Yu Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0004:Yu", "Xing Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Xing", "Qiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Qiang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
