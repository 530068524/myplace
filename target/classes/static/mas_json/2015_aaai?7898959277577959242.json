{"title": "An Unsupervised Framework of Exploring Events on Twitter: Filtering, Extraction and Categorization.", "fields": ["categorization", "haystack", "lexicon", "microblogging", "exploit"], "abstract": "Twitter, as a popular microblogging service, has become a new information channel for users to receive and exchange the most up-to-date information on current events. However, since there is no control on how users can publish messages on Twitter, finding newsworthy events from Twitter becomes a difficult task like \"finding a needle in a haystack\".\n\nIn this paper we propose a general unsupervised framework to explore events from tweets, which consists of a pipeline process of filtering, extraction and categorization. To filter out noisy tweets, the filtering step exploits a lexicon-based approach to separate tweets that are event-related from those that are not. Then, based on these event-related tweets, the structured representations of events are extracted and categorized automatically using an unsupervised Bayesian model without the use of any labelled data. Moreover, the categorized events are assigned with the event type labels without human intervention. The proposed framework has been evaluated on over 60 millions tweets which were collected for one month in December 2010. A precision of 70.49% is achieved in event extraction, outperforming a competitive baseline by nearly 6%. Events are also clustered into coherence groups with the automatically assigned event type label.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Southeast University", "Southeast University", "Aston University"], "authors": ["Deyu Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Deyu", "Liangyu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Liangyu", "Yulan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yulan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
