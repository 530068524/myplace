{"title": "Content Models with Attitude.", "fields": ["snippet", "social media", "probabilistic logic", "topic model", "inference"], "abstract": "We present a probabilistic topic model for jointly identifying properties and attributes of social media review snippets. Our model simultaneously learns a set of properties of a product and captures aggregate user sentiments towards these properties. This approach directly enables discovery of highly rated or inconsistent properties of a product. Our model admits an efficient variational mean-field inference algorithm which can be parallelized and run on large snippet collections. We evaluate our model on a large corpus of snippets from Yelp reviews to assess property and attribute prediction. We demonstrate that it outperforms applicable baselines by a considerable margin.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Christina Sauper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sauper:Christina", "Aria Haghighi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haghighi:Aria", "Regina Barzilay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barzilay:Regina"], "pages": 9}
