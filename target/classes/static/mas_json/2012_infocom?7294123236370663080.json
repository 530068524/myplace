STROBE is a cross-layer approach that exploits the multi-stream capabilities of existing technologies such as 802.11n and the upcoming 802.11ac standard where multi-antenna APs can construct simultaneous data streams using Zero-Forcing Beamforming (ZFBF). Instead of using this technique for simultaneous data stream generation, STROBE utilizes ZFBF by allowing an AP to use one stream to communicate with an intended user and the remaining streams to orthogonally \u201cblind\u201d (actively interfere with) any potential eavesdropper thereby preventing eavesdroppers from decoding nearby transmissions. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we show that STROBE consistently outperforms Omnidirectional, Single-User Beamforming (SUBF), and directional antenna based transmission methods by keeping the transmitted signal at the intended receiver and shielded from eavesdroppers. In an indoor Wireless LAN environment, STROBE consistently serves an intended user with an SINR 15 dB greater than an eavesdropper.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Hewlett-Packard", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Narendra Anand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anand:Narendra", "Sung-Ju Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sung=Ju", "Edward W.
