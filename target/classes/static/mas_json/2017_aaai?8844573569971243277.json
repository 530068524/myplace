In particular, we focus on detecting planar surfaces, which are common in most structured or semi-structured environments. This segmentation is then used to minimize the amount of parameters necessary to properly create a 3D occupancy model of the surveyed space, thus increasing computational speed and decreasing memory requirements. As the 3D modeling tool, an extension to Hilbert Maps was selected, since it naturally uses a feature-based representation of the environment to achieve real-time performance. Experiments conducted in simulated and real large-scale datasets show a substantial gain in performance, while decreasing the amount of stored information by orders of magnitude without sacrificing accuracy.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Sydney", "University of Sydney"], "authors": ["Vitor Campanholo Guizilini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guizilini:Vitor_Campanholo", "Fabio Tozeto Ramos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramos:Fabio_Tozeto"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
