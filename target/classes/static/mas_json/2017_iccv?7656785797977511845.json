Specifically, we pose a cooperative \u2018image guessing\u2019 game between two agents \u2013 Q-BOT and A-BOT\u2013 who communicate in natural language dialog so that Q-BOT can select an unseen image from a lineup of images. We use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents end-to-end \u2013 from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward.,,We demonstrate two experimental results.,,First, as a \u2018sanity check\u2019 demonstration of pure RL (from scratch), we show results on a synthetic world, where the agents communicate in ungrounded vocabularies, i.e., symbols with no pre-specified meanings (X, Y, Z). We find that two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain symbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes (shape/color/style). Thus, we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among \u2018visual\u2019 dialog agents with no human supervision.,,Second, we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset [5], where we pretrain on dialog data with supervised learning (SL) and show that the RL finetuned agents significantly outperform supervised pretraining. Interestingly, the RL Q-BOT learns to ask questions that A-BOT is good at, ultimately resulting in more informative dialog and a better team.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Abhishek Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Abhishek", "Satwik Kottur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kottur:Satwik", "Jos\u00e9 M.
