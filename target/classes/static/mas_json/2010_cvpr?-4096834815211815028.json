Unlike previous methods which focus on the original spatial resolution, we hierarchically reduce the disparity search range. By fixing the number of disparity levels on the original resolution, our method solves the message updating problem in a time linear in the number of pixels contained in the image and requires only constant memory space. Specifically, for a 800 \u00d7 600 image with 300 disparities, our message updating method is about 30\u00d7 faster (1.5 second) than standard method, and requires only about 0.6% memory (9 MB). Also, our algorithm lends itself to a parallel implementation. Our GPU implementation (NVIDIA Geforce 8800GTX) is about 10\u00d7 faster than our CPU implementation. Given the trend toward higher-resolution images, stereo matching using belief propagation with large number of disparity levels as efficient as the small ones makes our method future-proof. In addition to the computational and memory advantages, our method is straightforward to implement 1 .", "citation": "Citations (261)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Kentucky", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Qingxiong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Qingxiong", "Liang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Liang", "Narendra Ahuja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahuja:Narendra"], "pages": 8}
