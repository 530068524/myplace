{"title": "Doubly Accelerated Stochastic Variance Reduced Dual Averaging Method for Regularized Empirical Risk Minimization.", "fields": ["variance reduction", "regular polygon", "empirical risk minimization", "training set", "convex function"], "abstract": "We develop a new accelerated stochastic gradient method for efficiently solving the convex regularized empirical risk minimization problem in mini-batch settings. The use of mini-batches has become a golden standard in the machine learning community, because the mini-batch techniques stabilize the gradient estimate and can easily make good use of parallel computing. The core of our proposed method is the incorporation of our new ``double acceleration'' technique and variance reduction technique. We theoretically analyze our proposed method and show that our method much improves the mini-batch efficiencies of previous accelerated stochastic methods, and essentially only needs size $\\sqrt{n}$ mini-batches for achieving the optimal iteration complexities for both non-strongly and strongly convex objectives, where $n$ is the training set size. Further, we show that even in non-mini-batch settings, our method achieves the best known convergence rate for non-strongly convex and strongly convex objectives.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["NTT DATA", "National Presto Industries"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tomoya Murata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murata:Tomoya", "Taiji Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Taiji"], "pages": 10}
