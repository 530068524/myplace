{"title": "CE-Storm: Confidential Elastic Processing of Data Streams.", "fields": ["operator", "scaling", "data stream", "data stream mining", "server"], "abstract": "Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) are crucial for modern high-volume/high-velocity data-driven applications, necessitating a distributed approach to processing them. In addition, data providers often require certain levels of confidentiality for their data, especially in cases of user-generated data, such as those coming out of physical activity/health tracking devices (i.e., our motivating application). This demonstration will showcase Synefo, an infrastructure that enables elastic scaling of DSMS operators, and CryptStream, a framework that provides confidentiality and access controls for data streams while allowing computation on untrusted servers, fused as  CE-Storm . We will demonstrate both systems working in tandem and also visualize their behavior over time under different scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Nick R.
