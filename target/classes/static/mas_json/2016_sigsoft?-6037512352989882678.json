{"title": "FSX: a tool for fine-grained incremental unit test generation for C/C++ programs.", "fields": ["symbolic execution", "test suite", "software deployment", "software quality", "unit testing"], "abstract": "Automated unit test generation bears the promise of significantly reducing test cost and hence improving software quality. However, the maintenance cost of the automatically generated tests presents a significant barrier to adoption of this technology. To address this challenge, in previous work, we proposed a novel technique for automated and fine-grained incremental generation of unit tests through minimal augmentation of an existing test suite. In this paper we describe a tool FSX, implementing this technique. We describe the architecture, user-interface, and salient features of FSX, and specific practical use-cases of its technology. We also report on a real, large-scale deployment of FSX, as a practical validation of the underlying research contribution and of automated test generation research in general.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Fujitsu", "Fujitsu", "Fujitsu", "Fujitsu", "Fujitsu"], "authors": ["Hiroaki Yoshida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshida:Hiroaki", "Susumu Tokumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tokumoto:Susumu", "Mukul R.
