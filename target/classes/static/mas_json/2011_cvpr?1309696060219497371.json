An action is originally modelled as a bag of visual-words (BoVW), which is sensitive to view changes. We argue that, as opposed to visual words, there exist some higher level features which can be shared across views and enable the connection of action models for different views. To discover these features, we use a bipartite graph to model two view-dependent vocabularies, then apply bipartite graph partitioning to co-cluster two vocabularies into visual-word clusters called bilingual-words (i.e., high-level features), which can bridge the semantic gap across view-dependent vocabularies. Consequently, we can transfer a BoVW action model into a bag-of-bilingual-words (BoBW) model, which is more discriminative in the presence of view changes. We tested our approach on the IXMAS data set and obtained very promising results. Moreover, to further fuse view knowledge from multiple views, we apply a Locally Weighted Ensemble scheme to dynamically weight transferred models based on the local distribution structure around each test example. This process can further improve the average recognition rate by about 7%.", "citation": "Citations (219)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Central Florida", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jingen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jingen", "Mubarak Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Mubarak", "Benjamin Kuipers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuipers:Benjamin", "Silvio Savarese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savarese:Silvio"], "pages": 8}
