Designing an automatic multimodal MCR system applicable to general medical data sets still presents an open research problem, as indicated by the ImageCLEF 2013 MCR challenge, where the best submitted runs achieved only moderate retrieval performance and used purely textual techniques. This project therefore aims at designing a multimodal MCR model that is capable of achieving a substantially better retrieval performance on the ImageCLEF data set than state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, the potential of further improvement by leveraging relevance feedback of medical expert users for long-term learning will be investigated.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt"], "authors": ["Mario Taschwer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taschwer:Mario"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
