{"title": "FREE-p: Protecting non-volatile memory against both hard and soft errors.", "fields": ["soft error", "pointer", "memory controller", "non volatile random access memory", "process variation"], "abstract": "Emerging non-volatile memories such as phase-change RAM (PCRAM) offer significant advantages but suffer from write endurance problems. However, prior solutions are oblivious to soft errors (recently raised as a potential issue even for PCRAM) and are incompatible with high-level fault tolerance techniques such as chipkill. To additionally address such failures requires unnecessarily high costs for techniques that focus singularly on wear-out tolerance. In this paper, we propose fine-grained remapping with ECC and embedded pointers (FREE-p). FREE-p remaps fine-grained worn-out NVRAM blocks without requiring large dedicated storage. We discuss how FREE-p protects against both hard and soft errors and can be extended to chipkill. Further, FREE-p can be implemented purely in the memory controller, avoiding custom NVRAM devices. In addition to these benefits, FREE-p increases NVRAM lifetime by up to 26% over the state-of-the-art even with severe process variation while performance degradation is less than 2% for the initial 7 years.", "citation": "Citations (176)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Doe Hyun Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Doe_Hyun", "Naveen Muralimanohar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muralimanohar:Naveen", "Jichuan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Jichuan", "Parthasarathy Ranganathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranganathan:Parthasarathy", "Norman P.
