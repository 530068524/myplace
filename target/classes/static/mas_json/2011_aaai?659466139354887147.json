The procedure obtains its solution by solving a sequence of unconstrained subproblems of minimizing $J(x)+\\frac{1}{2}\\|Ax-b^{k}\\|_{2}^{2}$ , where b k is iteratively updated. In practice, the subproblem at each iteration is solved at a relatively low accuracy. Let w k denote the error introduced by early stopping a subproblem solver at iteration k. We show that if all w k are sufficiently small so that Bregman iteration enters the optimal face, then while on the optimal face, Bregman iteration enjoys an interesting error-forgetting property: the distance between the current point $\\bar{x}^{k}$ and the optimal solution set X ? is bounded by ?w k+1?w k ?, independent of the previous errors w k?1,w k?2,?,w 1. This property partially explains why the Bregman iterative procedure works well for sparse optimization and, in particular, for ? 1-minimization. The error-forgetting property is unique to J(x) that is a piece-wise linear function (also known as a polyhedral function), and the results of this article appear to be new to the literature of the augmented Lagrangian method.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["Rice University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Western Sydney", "University of Western Sydney", "University of Iowa", "University of Notre Dame", "University of Florida", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Utah", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Istituto Dalle  ... o, Switzerland", "Istituto Dalle  ... o, Switzerland", "Istituto Dalle  ... o, Switzerland"], "authors": ["Yi Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yi", "Yan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Yan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
