{"title": "Guaranteed authenticity and integrity of data from untrusted servers.", "fields": ["data administration", "database server", "view", "database schema", "database testing"], "abstract": "Data are often stored at untrusted database servers. The lack of trust arises naturally when the database server is owned by a third party, as in the case of cloud computing. It also arises if the server may have been compromised, or there is a malicious insider. Ensuring the trustworthiness of data retrieved from such untrusted database is of utmost importance. Trustworthiness of data is defined by faithful execution of valid and authorized transactions on the initial data. Earlier work on this problem is limited to cases where data are either not updated, or data are updated by a single trustworthy entity. However, for a truly dynamic database, multiple clients should be allowed to update data without having to route the updates through a central server. In this demonstration, we present a system to establish authenticity and integrity of data in a dynamic database where the clients can run transactions directly on the database server. Our system provides provable authenticity and integrity of data with absolutely no requirement for the server to be trustworthy. Our system also provides assured provenance of data. This demonstration is built using the solutions proposed in our previous work[5]. Our system is built on top of Oracle with no modifications to the database internals. We show that the system can be easily adopted in existing databases without any internal changes to the database. We also demonstrate how our system can provide authentic provenance.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Rohit Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Rohit", "Sunil Prabhakar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakar:Sunil"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
