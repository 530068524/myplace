We derive these schemes by applying a hash proof technique from Alwen et.al. (Eurocrypt '10) to variants of the existing IBE schemes of Boneh-Boyen, Waters, and Lewko-Waters. As a result, we achieve leakage-resilience under the respective static assumptions of the original systems in the standard model, while also preserving the efficiency of the original schemes. Moreover, our results extend to the Bounded Retrieval Model (BRM), yielding the first regular and identity-based BRM encryption schemes from static assumptions in the standard model.   The first LR-IBE system, based on Boneh-Boyen IBE, is only selectively secure under the simple  Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman  assumption (DBDH), and serves as a stepping stone to our second fully secure construction. This construction is based on Waters IBE, and also relies on the simple DBDH. Finally, the third system is based on Lewko-Waters IBE, and achieves full security with shorter public parameters, but is based on three static assumptions related to composite order bilinear groups.", "citation": "Citations (159)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Sherman S.
