{"title": "A Unified Approach for Multi-step Temporal-Difference Learning with Eligibility Traces in Reinforcement Learning.", "fields": ["exponential growth", "pi", "sigma", "bellman equation", "temporal difference learning"], "abstract": "Recently, a new multi-step temporal learning algorithm, called $Q(\\sigma)$, unifies $n$-step Tree-Backup (when $\\sigma=0$) and $n$-step Sarsa (when $\\sigma=1$) by introducing a sampling parameter $\\sigma$. However, similar to other multi-step temporal-difference learning algorithms, $Q(\\sigma)$ needs much memory consumption and computation time. Eligibility trace is an important mechanism to transform the off-line updates into efficient on-line ones which consume less memory and computation time. In this paper, we further develop the original $Q(\\sigma)$, combine it with eligibility traces and propose a new algorithm, called $Q(\\sigma ,\\lambda)$, in which $\\lambda$ is trace-decay parameter. This idea unifies Sarsa$(\\lambda)$ (when $\\sigma =1$) and $Q^{\\pi}(\\lambda)$ (when $\\sigma =0$). Furthermore, we give an upper error bound of $Q(\\sigma ,\\lambda)$ policy evaluation algorithm. We prove that $Q(\\sigma,\\lambda)$ control algorithm can converge to the optimal value function exponentially. We also empirically compare it with conventional temporal-difference learning methods. Results show that, with an intermediate value of $\\sigma$, $Q(\\sigma ,\\lambda)$ creates a mixture of the existing algorithms that can learn the optimal value significantly faster than the extreme end ($\\sigma=0$, or $1$).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Long Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Long", "Minhao Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Minhao", "Qian Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Qian", "Wenjia Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Wenjia", "Gang Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Gang"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
