{"title": "Schedulability Analysis of Non-preemptive Real-Time Scheduling for Multicore Processors with Shared Caches.", "fields": ["multi core processor", "cache", "embedded software", "shared memory", "integer programming"], "abstract": "Shared caches in multicore processors introduce serious difficulties in providing guarantees on the real-time properties of embedded software due to the interaction and the resulting contention in the shared caches. To address this problem, we develop a new schedulability analysis for real-time multicore systems with shared caches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the schedulability problem with inter-core cache interference. We construct an integer programming formulation, which can be transformed to an integer linear programming formulation, to calculate an upper bound on cache interference exhibited by a task within a given execution window. Using the integer programming formulation, an iterative algorithm is presented to obtain the upper bound on cache interference a task may exhibit during one job execution. The upper bound on cache interference is subsequently integrated into the schedulability analysis to derive a new schedulability condition. A range of experiments is performed to investigate how the schedulability is degraded by shared cache interference.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Jun Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Jun", "Sebastian Altmeyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altmeyer:Sebastian", "Andy D.
