Unfortunately, parametric specifications are not easy to formulate by nonexperts and, consequently, are rarely available. This paper presents a general approach for mining parametric specifications from program executions, based on a strict separation of concerns: (1) a trace slicer first extracts sets of independent interactions from parametric execution traces; and (2) the resulting non-parametric trace slices are then passed to any conventional non-parametric property learner. The presented technique has been implemented in jMiner, which has been used to automatically mine many meaningful and non-trivial parametric properties of OpenJDK 6.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Choonghwan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Choonghwan", "Feng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0006:Feng", "Grigore Rosu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosu:Grigore"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
