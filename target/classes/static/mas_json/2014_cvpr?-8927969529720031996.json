However, using context to improve unsupervised human action clustering has never been considered before, and cannot be achieved using existing clustering methods. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel, general purpose algorithm, Dual Assignment k-Means (DAKM), which is uniquely capable of performing two co-occurring clustering tasks simultaneously, while exploiting the correlation information to enhance both clusterings. Furthermore, we describe a spectral extension of DAKM (SDAKM) for better performance on realistic data. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and on three realistic human action datasets with scene context show that DAKM/SDAKM can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art clustering methods by taking into account the contextual relationship between actions and scenes.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "University of Sheffield"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Simon Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones:Simon", "Ling Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao_0001:Ling"], "pages": 8}
