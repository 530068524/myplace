We assume that the dataset is partitioned and stored across nodes of a cluster. Our procedure involves an independent MCMC posterior sampler at each node based on its local partition of the data. Moment statistics of the local posteriors are collected from each sampler and propagated across the cluster using expectation propagation message passing with low communication costs. The moment sharing scheme improves posterior estimation quality by enforcing agreement among the samplers. We demonstrate the speed and inference quality of our method with empirical studies on Bayesian logistic regression and sparse linear regression with a spike-and-slab prior.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "University College London", "University of Oxford", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Minjie Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Minjie", "Balaji Lakshminarayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lakshminarayanan:Balaji", "Yee Whye Teh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teh:Yee_Whye", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Bo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0010:Bo"], "pages": 9}
