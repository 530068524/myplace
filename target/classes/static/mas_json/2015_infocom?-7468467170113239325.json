Information exchange is a basic operation in which each node of the network sends an information packet to other nodes within a specific distance R. Our study is motivated by the increasing presence and popularity of wireless networks and devices that operate on multiple channels. Consequently, there is a need for a better understanding of how and by how much multiple channels can improve communication. Based on the SINR interference model, we propose a multi-channel network model which incorporates certain features commonly seen in wireless ad hoc networks, including asynchrony, little non-local knowledge, limited message size, and limited power control. We then present a randomized algorithm that can accomplish information exchange in O ((\u0394/F + \u0394log n/P) log n + log \u0394 log n) timeslots with high probability, where n is the number of nodes in the network, \u0394 is the maximum number of nodes within the range R, F is the number of available channels and P is the maximum number of packets that can fit in a message. Our algorithm significantly surpasses the best known results in single-channel networks, achieving a \u0398(F) times speedup if \u0394 and P are sufficiently large. We conducted empirical studies that confirmed the performance of the proposed algorithm as derived in the analysis.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "Zhejiang University", "Tsinghua University", "Qufu Normal University", "University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Dongxiao Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Dongxiao", "Yuexuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuexuan", "Yu Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Yu", "Jiguo Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jiguo", "Francis C.
