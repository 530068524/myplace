This paper presents DesignScape, a system which aids the design process by making interactive layout suggestions, i.e., changes in the position, scale, and alignment of elements. The system uses two distinct but complementary types of suggestions: refinement suggestions, which improve the current layout, and brainstorming suggestions, which change the style. We investigate two interfaces for interacting with suggestions. First, we develop a suggestive interface, where suggestions are previewed and can be accepted. Second, we develop an adaptive interface where elements move automatically to improve the layout. We compare both interfaces with a baseline without suggestions, and show that for novice designers, both interfaces produce significantly better layouts, as evaluated by other novices.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Adobe Systems", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Peter O'Donovan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Donovan:Peter", "Aseem Agarwala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwala:Aseem", "Aaron Hertzmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hertzmann:Aaron"], "pages": 4}
