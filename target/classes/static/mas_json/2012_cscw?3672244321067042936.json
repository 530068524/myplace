We posit the existence of a latent demand for contribution: many users want to contribute but don't. We then test a simple interface that can induce these users to actually contribute: we display a popup window asking users to contribute. In a real-world randomized field experiment, we found that asking them to contribute right now is ineffective, but reminding the users to contribute actually leads to approximately a 23% increase in contributions with no reduction in quality. However, this effect wanes as users habituate to the popups.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Rick Wash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wash:Rick", "Cliff Lampe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampe:Cliff"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
