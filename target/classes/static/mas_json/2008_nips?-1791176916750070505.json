We constraint the mean-payoff function with a dissimilarity function over X in a way that is more general than Lipschitz. We construct an arm selection policy whose regret improves upon previous result for a large class of problems. In particular, our results imply that if X is the unit hypercube in a Euclidean space and the mean-payoff function has a finite number of global maxima around which the behavior of the function is locally Holder with a known exponent, then the expected regret is bounded up to a logarithmic factor by $\\sqrt{n}$, i.e., the rate of the growth of the regret is independent of the dimension of the space. Moreover, we prove the minimax optimality of our algorithm for the class of mean-payoff functions we consider.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "University of Alberta", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["S\u00e9bastien Bubeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bubeck:S=eacute=bastien", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi", "Gilles Stoltz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoltz:Gilles", "Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szepesv=aacute=ri:Csaba"], "pages": 8}
