We extract the surrounding textual context of the pronoun and gather, from a large corpus, the distribution of words that occur within that context. We learn to reliably classify these distributions as representing either referential or non-referential pronoun instances. Despite its simplicity, experimental results on classifying the English pronoun it show the system achieves the highest performance yet attained on this important task.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Google", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shane Bergsma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergsma:Shane", "Dekang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Dekang", "Randy Goebel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goebel:Randy"], "pages": 9}
