{"title": "Tradeoffs between Incentive Mechanisms in Boolean Games.", "fields": ["nash equilibrium", "search algorithm", "economics", "incentive", "welfare economics"], "abstract": "Two incentive mechanisms for Boolean games were proposed recently - taxation schemes and side payments. Both mechanisms have been shown to be able to secure a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) for Boolean games. A complete characterization of outcomes that can be transformed to PNEs is given for each of the two incentive mechanisms. Side payments are proved to be a weaker mechanism in the sense that the outcomes that they can transform to PNEs are a subset of those transformable by taxation. A family of social-network-based Boolean games, which demonstrates the differences between the two mechanisms for securing a PNE, is presented. A distributed search algorithm for finding the side payments needed for securing a PNE is proposed. An empirical evaluation demonstrates the properties of the two mechanisms on the family of social-network-based Boolean games.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ariel University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Vadim Levit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levit:Vadim", "Zohar Komarovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komarovsky:Zohar", "Tal Grinshpoun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grinshpoun:Tal", "Amnon Meisels.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meisels:Amnon"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
