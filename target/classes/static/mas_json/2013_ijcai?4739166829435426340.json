In practice, this constraint suffers from the rigidity of its semantics. To tackle this issue, we propose three generalizations of the FOCUS constraint. We provide for each one a complete filtering algorithm as well as discussing decompositions.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["NICTA", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Institut national des sciences appliqu\u00e9es de Toulouse", "NICTA"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Nina Narodytska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narodytska:Nina", "Thierry Petit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petit:Thierry", "Mohamed Siala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siala_0002:Mohamed", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "pages": 7}
