{"title": "G-CNN: An Iterative Grid Based Object Detector.", "fields": ["alpha numeric grid", "object detection", "grid file", "grid", "detector"], "abstract": "We introduce G-CNN, an object detection technique based on CNNs which works without proposal algorithms. G-CNN starts with a multi-scale grid of fixed bounding boxes. We train a regressor to move and scale elements of the grid towards objects iteratively. G-CNN models the problem of object detection as finding a path from a fixed grid to boxes tightly surrounding the objects. G-CNN with around 180 boxes in a multi-scale grid performs comparably to Fast R-CNN which uses around 2K bounding boxes generated with a proposal technique. This strategy makes detection faster by removing the object proposal stage as well as reducing the number of boxes to be processed.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mahyar Najibi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Najibi:Mahyar", "Mohammad Rastegari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rastegari:Mohammad", "Larry S.
