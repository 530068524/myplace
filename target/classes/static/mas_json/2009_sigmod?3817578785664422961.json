As aggregators can be untrusted or compromised, it is essential for a sensing service to be able to verify the correctness of aggregation results. This work presents SECOA, a framework with a family of novel and optimally-secure protocols for secure outsourced aggregation. Our framework is based on a unified use of one-way chains. It supports a large and diverse set of aggregate functions, can have multiple hierarchically organized aggregators, can deterministically detect any malicious aggregation behavior without communication with sensors, and incurs a small and workload-independent communication load on sensors. We also present extensive evaluation results to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Microsoft", "National University of Singapore", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Suman Nath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nath:Suman", "Haifeng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Haifeng", "Haowen Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Haowen"], "pages": 14}
