{"title": "On Round-Optimal Zero Knowledge in the Bare Public-Key Model.", "fields": ["modular exponentiation", "mathematical proof", "zero knowledge proof", "commitment scheme", "public key cryptography"], "abstract": "In this paper we revisit previous work in the BPK model and point out subtle problems concerning security proofs of concurrent and resettable zero knowledge (c\u01b5\u0198 and r\u01b5\u0198, for short). Our analysis shows that the c\u01b5\u0198 and r\u01b5\u0198 simulations proposed for previous (in particular all round-optimal) protocols are distinguishable from real executions. Therefore some of the questions about achieving round optimal c\u01b5\u0198 and r\u01b5\u0198 in the BPK model are still open. We then show our main protocol, \u03a0c\u01b5\u0198, that is a round-optimal concurrently sound c\u01b5\u0198 argument of knowledge (AoK, for short) for NP under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions. Next, using complexity leveraging arguments, we show a protocol \u03a0r\u01b5\u0198 that is round-optimal and concurrently sound r\u01b5\u0198 for NP. Finally we show that \u03a0c\u01b5\u0198 and \u03a0r\u01b5\u0198 can be instantiated efficiently through transformations based on number-theoretic assumptions. Indeed, starting from any language admitting a perfect \u03a3-protocol, they produce concurrently sound protocols \u03a0c\u01b5\u0198 and \u03a0r\u01b5\u0198, where \u03a0c\u01b5\u0198 is a round-optimal c\u01b5\u0198AoK, and \u03a0r\u01b5\u0198 is a 5-round r\u01b5\u0198 argument. The r\u01b5\u0198 protocols are mainly inherited from the ones of Yung and Zhao [31].", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Salerno", "University of Salerno"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Alessandra Scafuro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scafuro:Alessandra", "Ivan Visconti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Visconti:Ivan"], "pages": 19}
