An integrated set of these elements is called a domain-specific development infrastructure (DSDI). DSDIs are commonly created in a costly, ad-hoc fashion because current model-driven engineering (MDE) technologies lack sufficient mechanisms for capturing the semantics of domain concepts. In this paper, we propose a methodology for incorporating semantics within MDE frameworks to simplify and automate DSDI integration. We also present and evaluate a framework, called XTEAM, that implements our approach, resulting in structured processes and enforceable guidelines for DSDI integration. We have applied our approach to several DSDIs, and report on the benefits accrued.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["George Edwards.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edwards:George", "Nenad Medvidovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medvidovic:Nenad"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
