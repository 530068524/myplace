Previous research on differential privacy has focused on designing measurement processes whose output is likely to be useful on its own. We consider the potential of applying probabilistic inference to the measurements and measurement process to derive posterior distributions over the data sets and model parameters thereof. We find that probabilistic inference can improve accuracy, integrate multiple observations, measure uncertainty, and even provide posterior distributions over quantities that were not directly measured.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Oliver Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Oliver", "Frank McSherry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McSherry:Frank"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
