{"title": "Generating Concise Entity Matching Rules.", "fields": ["program synthesis", "interpretability", "negation", "data integration", "personalization"], "abstract": "Entity matching (EM) is a critical part of data integration and cleaning. In many applications, the users need to understand why two entities are considered a match, which reveals the need for  interpretable  and  concise  EM rules. We model EM rules in the form of  General Boolean Formulas  ( GBF s) that allows arbitrary attribute matching combined by conjunctions (\u2228), disjunctions (\u2227), and negations. (\u00ac)  GBF s can generate more concise rules than traditional EM rules represented in disjunctive normal forms ( DNF s). We use  program synthesis , a powerful tool to automatically generate rules (or programs) that provably satisfy a high-level specification, to automatically synthesize EM rules in  GBF  format, given  only  positive and negative matching examples.   In this demo, attendees will experience the following features: (1)  Interpretability  -- they can see and measure the conciseness of EM rules defined using  GBF s; (2)  Easy customization  -- they can provide custom experiment parameters for various datasets, and, easily modify a rich predefined (default) synthesis grammar, using a Web interface; and (3)  High performance  -- they will be able to compare the generated concise rules, in terms of accuracy, with probabilistic models (e.g., machine learning methods), and hand-written EM rules provided by experts. Moreover, this system will serve as a general platform for evaluating different methods that discover EM rules, which will be released as an open-source tool on GitHub.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Arizona State University", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Arizona State University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Rohit Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh_0002:Rohit", "Venkata Vamsikrishna Meduri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meduri:Venkata_Vamsikrishna", "Ahmed K.
