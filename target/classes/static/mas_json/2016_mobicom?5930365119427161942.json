DopEnc can automatically identify the persons that users interact with in the context of encountering. DopEnc performs encounter profiling in two major steps: (1) Doppler profiling to detect that two persons approach and stop in front of each other via an  effective  trajectory, and (2) voice profiling to confirm that they are thereafter engaged in an interactive conversation. DopEnc is further extended to support parallel acoustic exploration of many users by incorporating a unique multiple access scheme within the limited inaudible acoustic frequency band. All implementation of DopEnc is based on commodity sensors like speakers, microphones and accelerometers integrated on commercial-off-the-shelf smartphones. We evaluate DopEnc with detailed experiments and a real use-case study of 11 participants. Overall DopEnc achieves an accuracy of 6.9% false positive and 9.7% false negative in real usage.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "authors": ["Huanle Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Huanle", "Wan Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Wan", "Pengfei Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Pengfei", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo", "Prasant Mohapatra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohapatra:Prasant"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
