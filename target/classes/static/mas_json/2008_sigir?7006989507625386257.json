Much of this work focuses on modeling and establishing a profile for each user to aid in personalization. Our work takes a more query-centric approach. In this paper, we present a method for efficient, automatic identification of a class of queries we define as  localizable  from a web search engine query log. We determine a set of relevant features and use conventional machine learning techniques to classify queries. Our experiments find that our technique is able to identify localizable queries with 94% accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Michael J.
