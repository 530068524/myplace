{"title": "Cloudy forecast: an exploration of the factors underlying shared repository use.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "task management", "qualitative research", "affordance", "software versioning"], "abstract": "Many teams are now adopting  shared repositories  for their work. Such adoption is paradoxical, however, as past research has repeatedly shown major  co-organizational barriers ; teams cannot agree a common organizational scheme, making it difficult to retrieve information organized by others. Another barrier is  email competition ; email provides a reliable alternative for distributing files that are then personally organized. To address this paradox, we explored how 27 participants actively using shared repositories overcome these barriers in a qualitative study. We found teams addressed co-organization using 4 strategies. First they create  ContentMaps  that provide explicit structure to organize shared information. Participants also co-organize using implicit strategies based on  task structure, expertise , and  tool affordances . Greater shared repository use also leads to a changed role for email. Versioning problems mean email is not used for distributing attachments, instead for task management. We present technical implications suggesting how new tools might be better integrated with email facilitating these continued email uses.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Imimtek, Inc, P ... o Alto, CA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Charlotte Massey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massey:Charlotte", "Thomas Lennig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lennig:Thomas", "Steve Whittaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittaker:Steve"], "pages": 10}
