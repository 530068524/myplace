For a given change in a requirements document, NARCIA calculates quantitative scores suggesting how likely each requirements statement in the document is to be impacted. These scores, computed using Natural Language Processing (NLP), are used for sorting the requirements statements, enabling the user to focus on statements that are most likely to be impacted. To increase the accuracy of change impact analysis, NARCIA provides a mechanism for making explicit the rationale behind changes. NARCIA has been empirically evaluated on two industrial case studies. The results of this evaluation are briefly highlighted.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "SES TechCom, Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Chetan Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora_0002:Chetan", "Mehrdad Sabetzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabetzadeh:Mehrdad", "Arda Goknil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goknil:Arda", "Lionel C.
