This field study in the upstream oil and gas industry illustrates that apart from geographical distribution, the onshore and offshore teams are confronted by considerable challenges due to asymmetries in tasks related, demographic, and cultural attributes. While with the industrywide move towards real-time data and video communication physical distances have become easier to bridge, other asymmetries still require attention. Using semi-structured interviews and observations, coordination requirements between subgroups, interdependencies, and task-specific asymmetries were identified. Implications for media requirements to support distributed asymmetric teams are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Petra Saskia Bayerl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bayerl:Petra_Saskia", "Kristina Lauche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lauche:Kristina"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
