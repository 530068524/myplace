The metrics can be used to understand and diagnose query performance issues. However, analytic queries over big data presents new challenges for query monitoring tools. A long-running query may generate tens of thousands of values so simply reporting the metrics may overwhelm the user. Second, analytic queries may be written by database novices who have trouble interpreting the metrics. Third, analytic queries may access data or processing outside the database through user-defined functions and connectors. The impact of these on query performance must be understood. Vertica Query Analyzer (VQA) is a query monitoring tool to address these challenges. VQA is both a useful tool and a research platform for query analytics. It presents query performance metrics through a variety of views and granularities. In addition, it analyzes the metrics for typical performance problems and suggests corrective actions. We demonstrate VQA using TPC-DS queries which have a wide range of query duration and complexity.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "HP Vertica, Cam ... bridge, MA, USA", "HP Vertica, Cam ... bridge, MA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Alkis Simitsis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simitsis:Alkis", "Kevin Wilkinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilkinson:Kevin", "Jason Blais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blais:Jason", "Joe Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Joe"], "pages": 4}
