Instead of including TPs as additional constraints during minimization of the energy function, we devise an efficient algorithm for modifying the unary potentials such that the resulting segmentation is guaranteed with the desired properties. Our method is more flexible in the sense that it handles more topology constraints than previous methods, which were only able to enforce pairwise or global connectivity. In particular, our method is very fast, making it for the first time possible to enforce global topological properties in practical image segmentation tasks.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Bar-Ilan University", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chao", "Daniel Freedman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freedman:Daniel", "Christoph H.
