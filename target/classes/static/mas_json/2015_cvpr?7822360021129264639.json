Our method can be used to find globally-optimal matching solutions even for problems involving very large motions. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is competitive on the MPI-Sintel dataset and that it can significantly outperform existing methods on problems involving large motions.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ryan Kennedy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kennedy:Ryan", "Camillo J.
