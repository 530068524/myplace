{"title": "Eye movement analysis for activity recognition.", "fields": ["eye tracking", "activity recognition", "copying", "specific activity", "feature selection"], "abstract": "In this work we investigate eye movement analysis as a new modality for recognising human activity. We devise 90 different features based on the main eye movement characteristics: saccades, fixations and blinks. The features are derived from eye movement data recorded using a wearable electrooculographic (EOG) system. We describe a recognition methodology that combines minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection (mRMR) with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We validate the method in an eight participant study in an office environment using five activity classes: copying a text, reading a printed paper, taking hand-written notes, watching a video and browsing the web. In addition, we include periods with no specific activity. Using a person-independent (leave-one-out) training scheme, we obtain an average precision of 76.1% and recall of 70.5% over all classes and participants. We discuss the most relevant features and show that eye movement analysis is a rich and thus promising modality for activity recognition.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Andreas Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Andreas", "Jamie A.
