Recently, array databases have gained popularity for scientific data processing due to performance benefits. In this paper, we address uncertain data management in array databases, which may involve both  value uncertainty  within individual tuples and  position uncertainty  regarding where a tuple should belong in an array given uncertain dimension attributes. Our work defines the formal semantics of array operations under both value and position uncertainty. To address the new challenge raised by position uncertainty, we propose a suite of storage and evaluation strategies for array operations, with a focus on a new scheme that bounds the overhead of querying by strategically treating tuples with large variances via replication in storage. Results from real datasets show that for common workloads, our best-performing techniques outperform alternative methods based on state-of-the-art indexes by 1.7x to 4.3x for the  Subarray  operation and 1 to 2 orders of magnitude for  Structure-Join , at only a small storage cost.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Liping Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Liping", "Yanlei Diao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diao:Yanlei"], "pages": 16}
