{"title": "Application of Formal Word-Level Analysis to Constrained Random Simulation.", "fields": ["constraint satisfaction problem", "hardware description language", "binary decision diagram", "boolean data type", "static analysis"], "abstract": "Constrained random simulation is supported by constraint solvers integrated within simulators. These constraint solvers need to be fast and memory efficient to maintain simulation performance. Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) have been successfully applied to represent constraints in this context. However, BDDs are vulnerable to size explosions depending on the constraints they are representing and the number of Boolean variables appearing in them. In this paper, we present a word-level analysis tool  DomRed to reduce the number of Boolean variables required to represent constraints by reducing the domain of constraint variables.  DomRed employs static analysis techniques to obtain these reductions. We present experimental results to illustrate the impact of this tool.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "Cadence Design Systems", "Cadence Design Systems", "Cadence Design Systems", "Cadence Design Systems"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Hyondeuk Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyondeuk", "HoonSang Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:HoonSang", "Kavita Ravi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravi:Kavita", "Petr Spacek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spacek:Petr", "John Pierce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pierce:John", "Robert P.
