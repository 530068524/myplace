{"title": "Consistency-preserving edit scripts in model versioning.", "fields": ["software development", "abstraction layer", "executable", "software versioning", "software evolution"], "abstract": "In model-based software development, models are iteratively evolved. To optimally support model evolution, developers need adequate tools for model versioning tasks, including comparison, patching, and merging of models. A significant disadvantage of tools currently available is that they display, and operate with, low-level model changes which refer to internal model representations and which can lead to intermediate inconsistent states. Higher-level consistency-preserving edit operations including refactorings are better suited to explain changes or to resolve conflicts. This paper presents an automatic procedure which transforms a low-level difference into an executable edit script which uses consistency-preserving edit operations only. Edit scripts support consistent model patching and merging on a higher abstraction level. Our approach to edit script generation has been evaluated in a larger real-world case study.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "Philipps-Univ.  ... arburg, Germany"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Timo Kehrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kehrer:Timo", "Udo Kelter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelter:Udo", "Gabriele Taentzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taentzer:Gabriele"], "pages": 11}
