This paper has two intentions: to offer guidance on practical issues when applying GT, and to clarify the space of methodological possibilities. We describe an extended GT study on understanding why practitioners choose particular usability evaluation methods. We describe five stages in this study to highlight our experiences and choices made. We draw out seven practical and methodological considerations in applying GT in a CHI context. This challenges the more traditional inductive and objective positions on GT use; it sensitizes novices of GT to these issues; and through the extended case study it provides substance for debate on issues that affect those that use qualitative methods more broadly.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dominic Furniss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furniss:Dominic", "Ann Blandford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blandford:Ann", "Paul Curzon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curzon:Paul"], "pages": 10}
