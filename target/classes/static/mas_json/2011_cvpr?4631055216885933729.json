Our representation is both conceptually and computationally superior to the bag-of-visual words: (1) We iteratively generate a Maximum Likelihood estimate of an image given a set of characteristic features in contrast to the BoW methods where an image is represented as a histogram of visual words, (2) We randomly sample a set of characteristic features instead of employing computation-intensive clustering algorithms used during the vocabulary generation step of BoW methods. Our performance compares favorably to the state-of-the-art on experiments over three challenging human action and a scene categorization dataset, demonstrating the universal applicability of our method.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Michigan State University", "University of Central Florida"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Subhabrata Bhattacharya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhattacharya:Subhabrata", "Rahul Sukthankar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sukthankar:Rahul", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong", "Mubarak Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Mubarak"], "pages": 8}
