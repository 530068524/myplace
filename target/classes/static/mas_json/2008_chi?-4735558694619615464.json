In this paper, we report on the design, implementation and evaluation of an automated meeting capture system that applies television production principles to capture and present videos of small group meetings in a compelling manner. The system uses inputs from a motion capture system and microphones to drive multiple pan-tilt-zoom cameras and uses heuristics to frame shots and cut between them. An evaluation of the system indicates that its performance approaches that of a professional crew while requiring significantly fewer human resources.", "citation": "Citations (39)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Cornell University", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Abhishek Ranjan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranjan:Abhishek", "Jeremy P.
