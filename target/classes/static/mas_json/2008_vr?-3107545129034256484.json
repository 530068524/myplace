The game provides a new and unique user experience, which links rich interactive content to time and places. We introduce the development of such a game, including a universal mechanism to define and setup multi-modal user interfaces for game challenges.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society"], "authors": ["Iris Herbst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herbst:Iris", "Anne-Kathrin Braun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braun:Anne=Kathrin", "Rod McCall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCall:Rod", "Wolfgang Broll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broll:Wolfgang"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
