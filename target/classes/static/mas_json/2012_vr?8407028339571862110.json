For maintaining appropriate omni-directional observation, the virtual objects must be situated in a certain volume. We first analyze and parameterize the volume derived from the geometrical configurations of the 3-D display. Then we simplify the volume as the primitive shape of a sphere. The volume visualizes the restrictions in the 3-D scene creation and helps content creators concentrate on their creative work using their favorite tools.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["NICT Universal  ... earch Institute"], "authors": ["Shunsuke Yoshida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshida:Shunsuke"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
