It differs from previous works in two aspects. First, we learn flexible face decomposition from real faces unsupervisedly instead of designing face template manually, for which two simple priors are embedded into learning procedure through constrained EM formulation. Second, both face representation and transition are derived from an unified probabilistic framework. Based on the learned face representation, the face distance measurement could be defined, which enables us to synthesize face via specifying distance with respect to reference faces and depict the full transition trace of two or more given faces with distinct age, gender and race.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Xiong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiong", "Liwei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Liwei", "Huanxi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Huanxi", "Yuncai Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yuncai"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
