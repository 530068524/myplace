{"title": "Aurio: Audio Processing, Analysis and Retrieval.", "fields": ["file format", "dynamic time warping", "novelty", "audio signal processing", "streams"], "abstract": "Aurio is an open source software library written for audio-based processing, analysis, and retrieval of audio and video recordings. The novelty of this library is the implementation of a number of fingerprinting and time warping algorithms to retrieve, match and synchronize media streams, which no other library currently offers. It is designed with simplicity, performance and versatility in mind, can be easily integrated into .NET applications, and offers a collection of many basic signal processing methods. It can read many file formats, offers multiple export abilities for further processing, and contains various UI widgets for graphical applications. Built upon the Aurio library, AudioAlign is an additionally released open source application for the (semi-)automatic synchronization of media recordings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt"], "authors": ["Mario Guggenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guggenberger:Mario"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
