Our tremor detection scheme uses inaudible sound emitted by the built-in speaker on the smartphone. We measure the movement of the hand by extracting the phase of sound waves reflected by the hand. Our application can classify whether the hand is static, moving, or trembling, without requiring the patient to hold the phone. The application can also determine the intensity of the tremor by measuring parameters such as the trembling frequency and the trembling magnitude.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wei", "Lei Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Lei", "Xun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xun"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
