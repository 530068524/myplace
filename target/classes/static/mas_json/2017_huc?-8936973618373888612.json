This is particularly true for cities like London, which are major tourist hubs and yet exhibit very high crime rates. In this paper, we propose CrimeSafe, a highly interactive and novel mobile application that shows police recorded and crowdsourced crimes in any London locality. The application displays crime data using colour coded maps at various aggregated granularity and also using location based services to proactively prompt users in taking appropriate cautionary measures. Initial evaluations demonstrate need and effectiveness of the application.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of East London", "University of East London", "University of East London", "University of East London"], "authors": ["Syed Islam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Islam:Syed", "Usman Naeem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naeem:Usman", "Mhd Saeed Sharif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharif:Mhd_Saeed", "Arnold Dovnarovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dovnarovic:Arnold"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
