{"title": "First-Fit Scheduling for Beaconing in Multihop Wireless Networks.", "fields": ["network packet", "approximation algorithm", "interference", "spread spectrum", "schedule"], "abstract": "Beaconing is a primitive communication task in which every node locally broadcasts a packet to all its neighbors within a fixed distance. Assume that all communications proceed in synchronous time-slots and each node can transmit at most one fixed-size packet in each time-slot. The problem Minimum-latency beaconing schedule (MLBS) in multihop wireless networks seeks a shortest schedule for beaconing subject to the interference constraint. MLBS has been intensively studied since the mid-1980s, but all assume the protocol interference model with uniform interference radii. In this paper, we first present a constant-approximation algorithm for MLBS under the protocol interference model with arbitrary interference radii. Then, we develop a constant-approximation algorithm for MLBS under the physical interference model. Both approximation algorithms have efficient implementations in a greedy first-fit manner.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Peng-Jun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Peng=Jun", "Zhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhu", "Hongwei Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Hongwei", "Scott C.-H.
