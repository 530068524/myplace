{"title": "Combining implicit and explicit topic representations for result diversification.", "fields": ["web resource", "random walk", "topic model", "diversification", "anchor text"], "abstract": "Result diversification deals with ambiguous or multi-faceted queries by providing documents that cover as many subtopics of a query as possible. Various approaches to subtopic modeling have been proposed. Subtopics have been extracted internally, e.g., from retrieved documents, and externally, e.g., from Web resources such as query logs. Internally modeled subtopics are often implicitly represented, e.g., as latent topics, while externally modeled subtopics are often explicitly represented, e.g., as reformulated queries.   We propose a framework that: i)combines both implicitly and explicitly represented subtopics; and ii)allows flexible combination of multiple external resources in a transparent and unified manner. Specifically, we use a random walk based approach to estimate the similarities of the explicit subtopics mined from a number of heterogeneous resources: click logs, anchor text, and web n-grams. We then use these similarities to regularize the latent topics extracted from the top-ranked documents, i.e., the internal (implicit) subtopics. Empirical results show that regularization with explicit subtopics extracted from the right resource leads to improved diversification results, indicating that the proposed regularization with (explicit) external resources forms better (implicit) topic models. Click logs and anchor text are shown to be more effective resources than web n-grams under current experimental settings. Combining resources does not always lead to better results, but achieves a robust performance. This robustness is important for two reasons: it cannot be predicted which resources will be most effective for a given query, and it is not yet known how to reliably determine the optimal model parameters for building implicit topic models.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["Centrum Wiskund ... am, Netherlands", "Centrum Wiskund ... am, Netherlands", "Centrum Wiskund ... am, Netherlands"], "authors": ["Jiyin He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Jiyin", "Vera Hollink.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hollink:Vera", "Arjen P. de Vries.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vries:Arjen_P=_de"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
