Such data is commonly modeled as Markovian streams; examples include words/sentences inferred from raw audio signals, or discrete location sequences inferred from RFID or GPS data. The rich semantics and large volumes of these streams make them difficult to query efficiently. In this paper, we study the effects\u2014on both efficiency and accuracy\u2014of two common stream approximations. Through experiments on a realworld RFID data set, we identify conditions under which these approximations can improve performance by several orders of magnitude, with only minimal effects on query results. We also identify cases when the full rich semantics are necessary.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Washington", "Intel"], "authors": ["Julie Letchner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Letchner:Julie", "Christopher R\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=eacute=:Christopher", "Magdalena Balazinska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balazinska:Magdalena", "Matthai Philipose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Philipose:Matthai"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
