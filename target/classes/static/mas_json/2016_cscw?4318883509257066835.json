Through their \u00e2  data narratives\u00e2   \u00e2   accounts of their data management practices, including device usage patterns and negotiations with system and brand ecosystems \u00e2   we explore how individuals negotiate a complex, multi-service, and morally-charged sociotechnical landscape, balancing demands to share and to safeguard their data in appropriate ways against a shifting background of changing technologies, relationships, individuals, and corporations. We describe the guiding framework that people use to make decisions as a \u00e2  moral economy\u00e2   of data management, contributing to our understanding of context-specific system choices.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Yahoo!", "Princeton University", "Cornell University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Janet Vertesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vertesi:Janet", "Jofish Kaye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaye:Jofish", "Samantha N.
