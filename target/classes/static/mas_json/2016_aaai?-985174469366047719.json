{"title": "Robust Complex Behaviour Modeling at 90Hz.", "fields": ["bernoulli distribution", "context model", "maximization", "matlab", "anomaly detection"], "abstract": "Modeling complex crowd behaviour for tasks such as rare event detection has received increasing interest. However, existing methods are limited because (1) they are sensitive to noise often resulting in a large number of false alarms; and (2) they rely on elaborate models leading to high computational cost thus unsuitable for processing a large number of video inputs in real-time. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by introducing a novel complex behaviour modeling framework, which consists of a Binarized Cumulative Directional (BCD) feature as representation, novel spatial and temporal context modeling via an iterative correlation maximization, and a set of behaviour models, each being a simple Bernoulli distribution. Despite its simplicity, our experiments on three benchmark datasets show that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art for both temporal video segmentation and rare event detection. Importantly, it is extremely efficient \u2014 reaches 90Hz on a normal PC platform using MATLAB.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Queen Mary University of London"], "authors": ["Xiangyu Kong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kong:Xiangyu", "Yizhou Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Yizhou", "Tao Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Tao"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
