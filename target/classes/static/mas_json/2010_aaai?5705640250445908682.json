{"title": "Combining Human Reasoning and Machine Computation: Towards a Memetic Network Solution to Satisfiability.", "fields": ["network model", "social computing", "computation", "knowledge representation and reasoning", "social network"], "abstract": "We propose a framework where humans and computers can collaborate seamlessly to solve problems. We do so by developing and applying a network model, namely Memenets, where human knowledge and reasoning are combined with machine computation to achieve problem-solving. The development of a Memenet is done in three steps: first, we simulate a machine-only network, as previous results have shown that memenets are efficient problem-solvers. Then, we perform an experiment with human agents organized in a online network. This allows us to investigate human behavior while solving problems in a social network and to postulate principles of agent communication in Memenets. These postulates describe an initial theory of how human-computer interaction functions inside social networks. In the third stage, postulates of step two allow one to combine human and machine computation to propose an integrated Memenet-based problem-solving computing model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul", "Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul", "Department of I ... elotas, Brazil"], "authors": ["Daniel S.
