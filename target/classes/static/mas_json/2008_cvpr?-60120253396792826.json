The maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) data association problem is mapped into a cost-flow network with a non-overlap constraint on trajectories. The optimal data association is found by a min-cost flow algorithm in the network. The network is augmented to include an explicit occlusion model(EOM) to track with long-term inter-object occlusions. A solution to the EOM-based network is found by an iterative approach built upon the original algorithm. Initialization and termination of trajectories and potential false observations are modeled by the formulation intrinsically. The method is efficient and does not require hypotheses pruning. Performance is compared with previous results on two public pedestrian datasets to show its improvement.", "citation": "Citations (706)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Li Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Li", "Yuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuan", "Ramakant Nevatia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nevatia:Ramakant"], "pages": -1}
