{"title": "RADA: a tool for reasoning about algebraic data types with abstractions.", "fields": ["recursion", "algebraic data type", "network security", "complex data type", "catamorphism"], "abstract": "We present RADA, a portable, scalable tool for reasoning about formulas containing algebraic data types using catamorphism (fold) functions. It can work as a back-end for reasoning about recursive programs that manipulate algebraic types. RADA operates by successively unrolling catamorphisms and uses either CVC4 and Z3 as reasoning engines. We have used RADA for reasoning about functional implementations of complex data structures and to reason about guard applications that determine whether XML messages should be allowed to cross network security domains. Promising experimental results demonstrate that RADA can be used in several practical contexts.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Tuan-Hung Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Tuan=Hung", "Michael W.
