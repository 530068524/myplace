In this paper, we explore online resource allocation policies which combine size-dependent scheduling with redundant execution and opportunistic checkpointing to minimize the overall job flowtime. We introduce a simplified model for the job service capacity of a computing cluster while leveraging redundant execution/checkpointing. In this setting, we propose two resource allocation algorithms, SRPT+R and LAPS+R(\u03b2) subject to checkpointing overhead not exceeding the number of jobs which are processed. We provide new theoretical performance bounds for these algorithms: SRPT+R is shown to be O(1/\u220a) competitive under (1 + \u220a)-speed resource augmentation, while LAPS+R(\u03b2) is shown to be O(1/\u03b2\u220a) competitive under (2+ 2\u03b2 + 2\u220a)-speed resource augmentation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dongguan University of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Huanle Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huanle", "Gustavo de Veciana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veciana:Gustavo_de", "Wing Cheong Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Wing_Cheong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
