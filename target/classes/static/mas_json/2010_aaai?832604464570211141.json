{"title": "A First Practical Algorithm for High Levels of Relational Consistency.", "fields": ["constraint logic programming", "sequential consistency", "weak consistency", "causal consistency", "hybrid algorithm"], "abstract": "Consistency properties and algorithms for achieving them are at the heart of the success of Constraint Programming. In this paper, we study the relational consistency property R(*,m)C, which is equivalent to m-wise consistency proposed in relational databases. We also define wR(*,m)C, a weaker variant of this property. We propose an algorithm for enforcing these properties on a Constraint Satisfaction Problem by tightening the existing relations and without introducing new ones. We empirically show that wR(*,m)C solves in a backtrack-free manner all the instances of some CSP benchmark classes, thus hinting at the tractability of those classes.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Montpellier"], "authors": ["Shant Karakashian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karakashian:Shant", "Robert J.
