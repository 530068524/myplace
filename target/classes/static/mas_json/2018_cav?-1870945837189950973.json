For example, we may need to draw a verdict on whether the system satisfies or violates the property \u201cp holds infinitely often.\u201d The problem is that there is always a continuation of a finite trace that satisfies the property and a different continuation that violates it.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Austrian Institute of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ezio Bartocci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartocci:Ezio", "Roderick Bloem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bloem:Roderick", "Dejan Nickovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nickovic:Dejan", "Franz R\u00f6ck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=ouml=ck:Franz"], "pages": 18}
