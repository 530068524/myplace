It is well-known that the corresponding proof system is not complete (unless one adds auxiliary variables). We describe a hierarchy of proof systems where each level  k  corresponds to a generalized notion of thread modularity (level 1 corresponds to the original notion). Each level is strictly more expressive than the previous. Further, each level precisely captures programs that can be proved using uniform Ashcroft invariants with  k  universal quantifiers. We demonstrate the usefulness of the hierarchy by giving a compositional proof of the Mach shootdown algorithm for TLB consistency. We show a proof at level 2 that shows the algorithm is correct for an arbitrary number of CPUs. However, there is no proof for the algorithm at level 1 which does not involve auxiliary state.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "MPI-SWS, Germany"], "authors": ["Jochen Hoenicke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoenicke:Jochen", "Rupak Majumdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majumdar:Rupak", "Andreas Podelski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Podelski:Andreas"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
