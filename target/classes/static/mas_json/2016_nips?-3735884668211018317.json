This paper introduces stochastic recurrent neural networks which glue a deterministic recurrent neural network and a state space model together to form a stochastic and sequential neural generative model. The clear separation of deterministic and stochastic layers allows a structured variational inference network to track the factorization of the model\u2019s posterior distribution. By retaining both the nonlinear recursive structure of a recurrent neural network and averaging over the uncertainty in a latent path, like a state space model, we improve the state of the art results on the Blizzard and TIMIT speech modeling data sets by a large margin, while achieving comparable performances to competing methods on polyphonic music modeling.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "Google", "Department of A ... omputer Science", "Copenhagen Cent ... alth Technology"], "authors": ["Marco Fraccaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fraccaro:Marco", "S\u00f8ren Kaae S\u00f8nderby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=oslash=nderby:S=oslash=ren_Kaae", "Ulrich Paquet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paquet:Ulrich", "Ole Winther.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winther:Ole"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
