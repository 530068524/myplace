{"title": "Active Dual Collaborative Filtering with Both Item and Attribute Feedback.", "fields": ["data set", "recommender system", "user profile", "random walk", "collaborative filtering"], "abstract": "The new user problem (aka user cold start) is very common in online recommender systems. Active collaborative filtering (active CF) tries to solve this problem by intelligently soliciting user feedback in order to build an initial user profile with minimal costs. Existing methods only query the user for feedback on items, while users can have preferences over items as well as certain item attributes. In this paper, we extend active CF via user feedback on both items and attributes. For example, when making movie recommendations, the system can ask users for not only their favorite movies, but also attributes such as genres, actors, etc. We design a unified active CF framework for incorporating both item and attribute feedback based on the random walk model. We test the active CF algorithm on real-world movie recommendation data sets to demonstrate that appropriately querying for both item and feature feedback can significantly reduce the overall user effort measured in terms of number of queries. We show that we can achieve much better recommendation quality as compared to traditional active CF methods that support only item feedback.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Luheng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Luheng", "Nathan Nan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Nathan_Nan", "Qiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Qiang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
