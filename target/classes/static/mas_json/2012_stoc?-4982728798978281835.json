We use this result to resolve several open problems regarding the computational complexity of computing key quantities associated with some classic and heavily studied stochastic processes, including multi-type branching processes and stochastic context-free grammars.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "Columbia University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Kousha Etessami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etessami:Kousha", "Alistair Stewart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stewart:Alistair", "Mihalis Yannakakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yannakakis:Mihalis"], "pages": 10}
