In this paper we introduce a novel approach to reason about liquid containability - the affordance of containing liquid. Our approach analyzes container objects based on two simple physical processes: the Fill and Transfer of liquid. First, it reasons about whether a given 3D object is a liquid container and its best filling direction. Second, it proposes directions to transfer its contained liquid to the outside while avoiding spillage. We compare our simplified model with a common fluid dynamics simulation and demonstrate that our algorithm makes human-like choices about the best directions to fill containers and transfer liquid from them. We apply our approach to reason about the containability of several real-world objects acquired using a consumer-grade depth camera.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Boston", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Singapore University of Technology and Design"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Lap-Fai Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Lap=Fai", "Noah Duncan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duncan:Noah", "Sai Kit Yeung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeung:Sai_Kit"], "pages": 9}
