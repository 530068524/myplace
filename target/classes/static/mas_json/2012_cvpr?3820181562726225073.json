Our approach integrates both depth and intensity information in a common framework. We show the benefit of our CLM-Z method in both accuracy and convergence rates over regular CLM formulation through experiments on publicly available datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate a way to combine a rigid head pose tracker with CLM-Z that benefits rigid head tracking. We show better performance than the current state-of-the-art approaches in head pose tracking with our extension of the generalised adaptive view-based appearance model (GAVAM).", "citation": "Citations (250)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "USC Institute f ... aterfront Drive"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tadas Baltrusaitis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baltrusaitis:Tadas", "Peter Robinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robinson_0001:Peter", "Louis-Philippe Morency.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morency:Louis=Philippe"], "pages": 8}
