{"title": "Jointly Modeling Review Content and Aspect Ratings for Review Rating Prediction.", "fields": ["deep learning", "business intelligence", "missing data", "semantics", "sentiment analysis"], "abstract": "Review rating prediction is of much importance for sentiment analysis and business intelligence. Existing methods work well when aspect-opinion pairs can be accurately extracted from review texts and aspect ratings are complete. The challenges of improving prediction accuracy are how to capture the semantics of review content and how to fill in the missing values of aspect ratings. In this paper, we propose a novel review rating prediction method, which improves the prediction accuracy by capturing deep semantics of review content and alleviating data missing problem of aspect ratings. The method firstly learns the latent vector representation of review content using skip-thought vectors, a state-of-the-art deep learning method, then, the missing values of aspect ratings are filled in based on users? history reviewing behaviors, finally, a novel optimization framework is proposed to predict the review rating. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Arizona", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Zhipeng Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Zhipeng", "Qiudan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qiudan", "Daniel Dajun Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Daniel_Dajun", "YongCheng Zhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhan:YongCheng", "Ruoran Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ruoran", "Lei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0062:Lei", "Hongyuan Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Hongyuan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
