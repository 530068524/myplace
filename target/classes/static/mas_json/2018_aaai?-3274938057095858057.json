{"title": "Dependence in Propositional Logic: Formula-Formula Dependence and Formula Forgetting - Application to Belief Update and Conservative Extension.", "fields": ["operator", "forgetting", "conservative extension", "propositional calculus", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Dependence is an important concept for many tasks in artificial intelligence. A task can be executed more efficiently by discarding something independent from the task. In this paper, we propose two novel notions of dependence in propositional logic: formula-formula dependence and formula forgetting. The first is a relation between formulas capturing whether a formula depends on another one, while the second is an operation that returns the strongest consequence independent of a formula. We also apply these two notions in two well-known issues: belief update and conservative extension. Firstly, we define a new update operator based on formula-formula dependence. Furthermore, we reduce conservative extension to formula forgetting.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": [], "authors": ["Liangda Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Liangda", "Hai Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Hai", "Xianqiao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xianqiao", "Biqing Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Biqing", "Zhao-Rong Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Zhao=Rong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
