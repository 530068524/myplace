{"title": "Coordinated Exploration in Concurrent Reinforcement Learning.", "fields": ["machine learning", "sampling", "pattern recognition", "regret", "reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "We consider a team of reinforcement learning agents that concurrently learn to operate in a common environment. We identify three properties - adaptivity, commitment, and diversity - which are necessary for efficient coordinated exploration and demonstrate that straightforward extensions to single-agent optimistic and posterior sampling approaches fail to satisfy them. As an alternative, we propose seed sampling, which extends posterior sampling in a manner that meets these requirements. Simulation results investigate how per-agent regret decreases as the number of agents grows, establishing substantial advantages of seed sampling over alternative exploration schemes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Maria Dimakopoulou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dimakopoulou:Maria", "Benjamin Van Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Benjamin_Van"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
