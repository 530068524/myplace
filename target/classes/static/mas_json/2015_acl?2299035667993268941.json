{"title": "Transferring Coreference Resolvers with Posterior Regularization.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "regularization", "robustness", "coreference", "resolver"], "abstract": "We propose a cross-lingual framework for learning coreference resolvers for resource-poor target languages, given a resolver in a source language. Our method uses word-aligned bitext to project information from the source to the target. To handle task-specific costs, we propose a softmax-margin variant of posterior regularization, and we use it to achieve robustness to projection errors. We show empirically that this strategy outperforms competitive cross-lingual methods, such as delexicalized transfer with bilingual word embeddings, bitext direct projection, and vanilla posterior regularization.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 F.
