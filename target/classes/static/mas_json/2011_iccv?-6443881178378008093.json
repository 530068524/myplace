{"title": "High quality image reconstruction from RAW and JPEG image pair.", "fields": ["file format", "design rule for camera file system", "jpeg file interchange format", "image file formats", "jpeg"], "abstract": "A camera RAW file contains minimally processed data from the image sensor. The contents of the RAW file include more information, and potentially higher quality, than the commonly used JPEG file. But the RAW file is typically several times larger than the JPEG file (taking fewer images, slower quick shooting) and lacks the standard file format (not ready-to-use, prolonging the image workflow). These drawbacks limit its applications. In this paper, we suggest a new \u201chybrid\u201d image capture mode: a high-res JPEG file and a low-res RAW file as alternative of the original RAW file. Most RAW users can be benefited from such a combination. To address this problem, we provide an effective approach to reconstruct a high quality image by combining the advantages of two kinds of files. We formulate this reconstruction process as a global optimization problem by enforcing two constraints: reconstruction constraint and detail consistency constraint. The final recovered image is smaller than the full-res RAW file, enables faster quick shooting, and has both richer information (e.g., color space, dynamic range, lossless 14 bits data) and higher resolution. In practice, the functionality of capturing such a \u201chybrid\u201d image pair in one-shot has been supported in some existing digital cameras.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Microsoft Research Asia (China)", "Microsoft Research Asia (China)"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Lu Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Lu", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian"], "pages": 8}
