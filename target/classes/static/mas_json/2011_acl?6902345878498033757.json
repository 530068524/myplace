{"title": "Adjoining Tree-to-String Translation.", "fields": ["bleu", "parsing", "string", "nist", "rule based machine translation"], "abstract": "We introduce synchronous tree adjoining grammars (TAG) into tree-to-string translation, which converts a source tree to a target string. Without reconstructing TAG derivations explicitly, our rule extraction algorithm directly learns tree-to-string rules from aligned Treebank-style trees. As tree-to-string translation casts decoding as a tree parsing problem rather than parsing, the decoder still runs fast when adjoining is included. Less than 2 times slower, the adjoining tree-to-string system improves translation quality by +0.7 BLEU over the baseline system only allowing for tree substitution on NIST Chinese-English test sets.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Yang", "Qun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qun", "Yajuan L\u00fc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=uuml=:Yajuan"], "pages": 10}
