{"title": "L1 rotation averaging using the Weiszfeld algorithm.", "fields": ["tangent space", "line search", "geometric median", "robustness", "norm"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of rotation averaging under the L 1  norm. This problem is related to the classic Fermat-Weber problem for finding the geometric median of a set of points in IR n . We apply the classical Weiszfeld algorithm to this problem, adapting it iteratively in tangent spaces of SO(3) to obtain a provably convergent algorithm for finding the L 1  mean. This results in an extremely simple and rapid averaging algorithm, without the need for line search. The choice of L 1  mean (also called geometric median) is motivated by its greater robustness compared with rotation averaging under the L 2  norm (the usual averaging process). We apply this problem to both single-rotation averaging (under which the algorithm provably finds the global L 1  optimum) and multiple rotation averaging (for which no such proof exists). The algorithm is demonstrated to give markedly improved results, compared with L 2  averaging. We achieve a median rotation error of 0.82 degrees on the 595 images of the Notre Dame image set.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Richard I.
