{"title": "Designing mobile health technology for bipolar disorder: a field trial of the monarca system.", "fields": ["health technology", "health care", "field trial", "bipolar disorder", "disease"], "abstract": "An increasing number of pervasive healthcare systems are being designed, that allow people to monitor and get feedback on their health and wellness. To address the challenges of self-management of mental illnesses, we have developed the MONARCA system - a personal monitoring system for bipolar patients. We conducted a 14 week field trial in which 12 patients used the system, and we report findings focusing on their experiences. The results were positive; compared to using paper-based forms, the adherence to self-assessment improved; the system was considered very easy to use; and the perceived usefulness of the system was high. Based on this study, the paper discusses three HCI questions related to the design of personal health technologies; how to design for disease awareness and self-treatment, how to ensure adherence to personal health technologies, and the roles of different types of technology platforms.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "departments": ["IT University of Copenhagen", "IT University of Copenhagen", "IT University of Copenhagen", "University Hosp ... nhagen, Denmark", "University Hosp ... nhagen, Denmark"], "authors": ["Jakob E.
