Auto-tuning has emerged as an alternative in which a black-box optimizer iteratively evaluates configurations to find efficient ones. Unfortunately, for many systems, such as distributed systems, evaluating performance takes too long and the space of configurations is too large for the optimizer to converge within a reasonable time.\n\nWe present BOAT, a framework which allows developers to build efficient bespoke auto-tuners for their system, in situations where generic auto-tuners fail. At BOAT's core is structured Bayesian optimization (SBO), a novel extension of the Bayesian optimization algorithm. SBO leverages contextual information provided by system developers, in the form of a probabilistic model of the system's behavior, to make informed decisions about which configurations to evaluate. In a case study, we tune the scheduling of a neural network computation on a heterogeneous cluster. Our auto-tuner converges within ten iterations. The optimized configurations outperform those found by generic auto-tuners in thirty iterations by up to 2X.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Valentin Dalibard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dalibard:Valentin", "Michael Schaarschmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaarschmidt:Michael", "Eiko Yoneki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoneki:Eiko"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
