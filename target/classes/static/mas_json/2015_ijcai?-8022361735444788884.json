Although these techniques appear to be rather different, they base their pruning decisions on similar ideas from a high level perspective. In this paper, we propose safe integrations of partial order reduction and symmetry elimination for cost-optimal classical planning. We show that previously proposed symmetry-based search algorithms can safely be applied with strong stubborn sets. In addition, we derive the notion of symmetrical strong stubborn sets as a more tightly integrated concept. Our experiments show the potential of our approaches.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Basel", "University of Basel", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "IBM"], "authors": ["Martin Wehrle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wehrle:Martin", "Malte Helmert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helmert:Malte", "Alexander Shleyfman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shleyfman:Alexander", "Michael Katz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katz_0001:Michael"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
