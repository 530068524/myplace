This problem is key in the development of tools for the on-line monitoring and analysis of streaming XML data, such as complex event streams, RSS feeds, or workflow traces. We introduce a novel technique that supports XML queries with any combination of the common XPath axes, namely, ancestor, descendant, parent, child, following, preceding, following-sibling, and preceding-sibling. At the heart of our approach lies an efficient transform that reduces a continuous XML query to an equi-join query over relational streams. We detail the transform and discuss its integration with randomized sketches as a basic mechanism to estimate the result of the XML query. We further enhance this mechanism with structural sieving, a technique that takes advantage of the XML data and query characteristics in order to improve the accuracy of the sketch-based approximation. We present an extensive experimental study on real-life and synthetic data sets that validates the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrates its advantages over existing techniques.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Veronica Mayorga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayorga:Veronica", "Neoklis Polyzotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polyzotis:Neoklis"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
