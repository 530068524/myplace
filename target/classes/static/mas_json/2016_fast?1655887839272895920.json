This mapping results in missed opportunities for a class of optimizations in which such coupling is removed.\n\nWe have designed, implemented, and evaluated a composite-file file system, which allows many-to-one mappings of files to metadata, and we have explored the design space of different mapping strategies. Under webserver and software development workloads, our empirical evaluation shows up to a 27% performance improvement. This result demonstrates the promise of composite files.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University"], "authors": ["Shuanglong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shuanglong", "Helen Catanese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catanese:Helen", "An-I Andy Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:An=I_Andy"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
