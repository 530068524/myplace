The ability to speak publicly requires a lot of training and practice. Recent technological developments enable new approaches for public speaking training that allow users to practice in a safe and engaging environment. We explore feedback strategies for public speaking training that are based on an interactive virtual audience paradigm. We investigate three study conditions: (1) a non-interactive virtual audience (control condition), (2) direct visual feedback, and (3) nonverbal feedback from an interactive virtual audience. We perform a threefold evaluation based on self-assessment questionnaires, expert assessments, and two objectively annotated measures of eye-contact and avoidance of pause fillers. Our experiments show that the interactive virtual audience brings together the best of both worlds: increased engagement and challenge as well as improved public speaking skills as judged by experts.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Mathieu Chollet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chollet:Mathieu", "Torsten W\u00f6rtwein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/W=ouml=rtwein:Torsten", "Louis-Philippe Morency.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morency:Louis=Philippe", "Ari Shapiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shapiro:Ari", "Stefan Scherer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scherer:Stefan"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
