{"title": "Generics of a higher kind.", "fields": ["parametric polymorphism", "generics in java", "option type", "abstract type", "type conversion"], "abstract": "With Java 5 and C# 2.0, first-order parametric polymorphism was introduced in mainstream object-oriented programming languages under the name of generics. Although the first-order variant of generics is very useful, it also imposes some restrictions: it is possible to abstract over a type, but the resulting type constructor cannot be abstracted over. This can lead to code duplication. We removed this restriction in Scala, by allowing type constructors as type parameters and abstract type members. This paper presents the design and implementation of the resulting type constructor polymorphism. Furthermore, we study how this feature interacts with existing object-oriented constructs, and show how it makes the language more expressive.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Adriaan Moors.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moors:Adriaan", "Frank Piessens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piessens:Frank", "Martin Odersky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Odersky:Martin"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2008", "pages": 16}
