{"title": "'Choose a Game': Creation and Evaluation of a Prototype Tool to Support Therapists in Brain Injury Rehabilitation.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "user experience design", "computer science", "rehabilitation", "case based reasoning"], "abstract": "Brain injury (BI) is recognized as a major health issue. It is common for therapists to include commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) games in their therapies to help motivate patients who have had a BI engage in rehabilitation tasks. In this paper, we present a prototype 'Choose a Game' tool that focuses on helping therapists select appropriate games that match their therapeutic goals and patient attributes. The tool leveraged a knowledge-base that we created about COTS games use in BI therapy. We evaluated the prototype through user studies with 29 therapists at two rehabilitation hospitals. While further improvements are needed, the tool enabled therapists to use games from a wider range of selections and therapists were generally satisfied with the game recommendations and the tool's user experience. This project is also a demonstration of a novel research model for investigating domains where technologies are rapidly proliferating for users with wide-ranging attributes such as the domain of therapeutic gaming for BI rehabilitation.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["DePaul University", "DePaul University", "Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science", "Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science", "Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Cynthia Putnam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Putnam:Cynthia", "Jinghui Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Jinghui", "Feng Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Feng", "Sai Yalla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yalla:Sai", "Stephanie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Stephanie"], "pages": 12}
