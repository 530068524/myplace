To overcome the limitations of the current experimental setups, we have designed a hybrid system that combines physical interaction and numerical simulation. This system relies on 3D-printed replicas of optical elements, which are augmented with pedagogical information. In this paper, we focus on the well-known Michelson interferometer experiment, widely studied in undergraduate programs of Science. A 3-months user study with 101 students and 6 teachers showed that, beyond the practical aspects offered by this system, such an approach enhances the technical and scientific learning compared to a standard Michelson interferometer experiment.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Bordeaux", "University of Lorraine", "University of Bordeaux", "University of Bordeaux", "University of Bordeaux"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David Furi\u00f3.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furi=oacute=:David", "St\u00e9phanie Fleck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fleck:St=eacute=phanie", "Bruno Bousquet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bousquet:Bruno", "Jean-Paul Guillet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guillet:Jean=Paul", "Lionel Canioni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canioni:Lionel", "Martin Hachet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hachet:Martin"], "pages": 11}
