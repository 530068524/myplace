Born in economics, stable matching efficiently resolves conflicts of interest among selfish agents in the market, with a simple and elegant procedure of deferred acceptance. We illustrate through one technical case study how it can be applied in practical scenarios where the impeding complexity of idiosyncratic factors makes defining a utility function difficult. Due to its use of generic preferences, stable matching has the potential to offer efficient and practical solutions to networking problems, while its mathematical structure and rich literature in economics provide many opportunities for theoretical studies. In closing, we discuss open questions when applying the stable matching framework.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Hong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Hong", "Baochun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baochun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
