We present an iterative rounding algorithm for this problem. When the graph is undirected and the connectivity requirements are on the element-connectivity with maximum value k, our algorithm computes a solution that is an O(k)-approximation for the edge cost in which the degree of each node v is at most O(k)b(v). We also consider the no edge cost case where the objective is to find a sub graph satisfying connectivity requirements and degree bounds. Our algorithm for this case outputs a solution in which the degree of each node v is at most 6b(v)+O(k^2). These algorithms can be extended to other well-studied undirected node-connectivity requirements such as uniform, subset and rooted connectivity. When the graph is directed and the connectivity requirement is k-out-connectivity from a root, our algorithm computes a solution that is a 2-approximation for the edge cost in which the degree of each node v is at most 2b(v) + O(k).", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Takuro Fukunaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukunaga:Takuro", "R.
