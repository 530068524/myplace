The manual annotation of objects in large image sets is tedious and unreliable. Therefore, a weakly supervised learning approach is desirable, where the training set needs only binary labels regarding whether an image contains the target object class. In the weakly supervised approach a detector is used to iteratively annotate the training set and learn the object model. We present a novel weakly supervised learning framework for learning an object detector. Our framework incorporates a new initial annotation model to start the iterative learning of a detector and a model drift detection method that is able to detect and stop the iterative learning when the detector starts to drift away from the objects of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging PASCAL 2007 dataset.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Parthipan Siva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siva:Parthipan", "Tao Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Tao"], "pages": 8}
