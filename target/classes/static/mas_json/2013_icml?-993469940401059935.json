We give theoretically-motivated feature multi-selection algorithms that choose, among a large set of candidate features, not only which features to judge but how many times to judge each one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for linear regression on a crowdsourced learning task of predicting people's height and weight from photos, using features such as gender and estimated weight as well as culturally fraught ones such as attractive.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Sivan Sabato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabato:Sivan", "Adam Kalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalai:Adam"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
