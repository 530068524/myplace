{"title": "Encoding the building blocks of communication.", "fields": ["implementation", "router", "computation", "communications protocol", "rendezvous"], "abstract": "Distributed systems are often built from the simplest building blocks such as message sends and RPCs. Since many communication patterns have to be reinvented every time a distributed system is created, implementing a high-level system is usually expensive. The recently proposed reactor model alleviates this cost by expressing distributed computations as reusable components, however, encodings for various communications patterns in this model are missing.     This paper investigates how to encode the router, client-server, scatter-gather, rendezvous, two-way communication, reliable communication and the backpressure protocol in the reactor model. These protocols are used to implement the core of a distributed streaming framework, and the performance of these implementations is evaluated.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation"], "conf": "oopsla", "authors": ["Aleksandar Prokopec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prokopec:Aleksandar"], "pages": 15}
