It was developed as a technology probe to help us open up current family archiving practices and to explore family archiving in situ. We detail the deployment and study of three of these devices in family homes and discuss how deploying a new, potentially disruptive, technology can foreground the social relations and organizing systems in domestic life. This in turn facilitates critical reflection on technology design.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["David S.
