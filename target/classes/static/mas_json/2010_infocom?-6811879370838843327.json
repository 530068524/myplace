In this paper, we revisit the problem of broadcasting multiple data blocks from a single source in an overlay network using gossip-like protocols. Our new finding reveals that the marginal benefit of network coding critically depends on the dynamics of network topologies. We show that although network coding is optimal as a block selection mechanism, simple non-coding protocols are close to optimal in complete and random graphs, leading to marginal benefits of network coding. However, network coding demonstrates salient benefits in clustered and time-varying topologies, which are common in real-world systems with ISP-locality mechanisms implemented. Through both theoretical analysis and simulation results, we unveil the underlying reasons behind discrepancies in the power of network coding under different scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Di Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Di", "Baochun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baochun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
