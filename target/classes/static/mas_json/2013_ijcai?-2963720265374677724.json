{"title": "Mining for Analogous Tuples from an Entity-Relation Graph.", "fields": ["kernel", "human intelligence", "tuple", "pairwise comparison", "structural similarity"], "abstract": "The ability to recognize analogies is an important factor that is closely related to human intelligence. Verbal analogies have been used for evaluating both examinees at university entrance exams as well as algorithms for measuring relational similarity. However, relational similarity measures proposed so far are confined to measuring the similarity between pairs of words. Unfortunately, such pairwise approaches ignore the rich relational structure that exists in real-world knowledge bases containing millions of entities and semantic relations. We propose a method to efficiently identify analogous entity tuples from a given entity-relation graph.\n\nFirst, we present an efficient approach for extracting potential analogous tuples from a given entity-relation graph. Second, to measure the structural similarity between two tuples, we propose two types of kernel functions: vertex-feature kernels, and edge-feature kernels. Moreover, we combine those kernels to construct composite kernels that simultaneously consider both vertex and edge features. Experimental results show that our proposed method accurately identifies analogous tuples and significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art pairwise relational similarity measure, extended to tuples.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Kyoto University", "National Institute of Informatics", "Japan Science a ...
