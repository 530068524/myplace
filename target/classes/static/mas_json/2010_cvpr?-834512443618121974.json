This paper investigates the property of solar shadow trajectories on a planar surface and shows that camera parameters, latitude, longitude can be estimated from two observed shadow trajectories. Our contribution is that we use the design of the analemmatic sundial to get the shadow conic and furthermore recover the camera's geographical location. The proposed method does not require the shadow casting objects or a vertical object to be visible in the recovery of camera calibration. This approach is thoroughly validated on both synthetic and real data, and tested against various sources of errors including noise and number of observations.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Tianjin University", "Tianjin University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Lin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Lin", "Xiaochun Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xiaochun"], "pages": 6}
