{"title": "Deep Matrix Factorization Models for Recommender Systems.", "fields": ["recommender system", "ranking", "matrix decomposition", "cross entropy", "binary number"], "abstract": "Recommender systems usually make personalized recommendation with user-item interaction ratings, implicit feedback and auxiliary information. Matrix factorization is the basic idea to predict a personalized ranking over a set of items for an individual user with the similarities among users and items. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization model with neural network architecture. Firstly, we construct a user-item matrix with explicit ratings and non-preference implicit feedback. With this matrix as the input, we present a deep structure learning architecture to learn a common low dimensional space for the representations of users and items. Secondly, we design a new loss function based on binary cross entropy, in which we consider both explicit ratings and implicit feedback for a better optimization. The experimental results show the effectiveness of both our proposed model and the loss function. On several benchmark datasets, our model outperformed other state-of-the-art methods. We also conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance within different experimental settings.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Hong-Jian Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Hong=Jian", "Xinyu Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Xinyu", "Jianbing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jianbing", "Shujian Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Shujian", "Jiajun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiajun"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
