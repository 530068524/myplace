PKBPs use branching conditions such as if the probability of \u03c6 is larger than p, and many more. While similar in spirit to value-based policies, PKBPs leverage the factored representation for more compactness. They also cope with more general goals than standard state-based rewards, such as pure information-gathering goals. Compactness comes at the price of reactivity, since evaluating branching conditions on-line is not polynomial in general. In this sense, PKBPs are complementary to other representations. Our intended application is as a tool for experts to specify policies in a natural, compact language, then have them verified automatically. We study succinctness and the complexity of verification for PKBPs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University", "University of Caen Lower Normandy"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Bruno Zanuttini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zanuttini:Bruno"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
