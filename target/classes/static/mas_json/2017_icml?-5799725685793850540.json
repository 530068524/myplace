We study distributed ADMM methods that boost performance by using different fine-tuned algorithm parameters on each worker node. We present a O(1/k) convergence rate for adaptive ADMM methods with node-specific parameters, and propose adaptive consensus ADMM (ACADMM), which automatically tunes parameters without user oversight.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "United States Naval Academy", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Lisbon", "Hong Kong Baptist University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Zheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0002:Zheng", "Gavin Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor:Gavin", "Hao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hao", "M\u00e1rio A.
