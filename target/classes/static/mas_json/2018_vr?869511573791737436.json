In a controlled human-subject study we investigated the effects of mismatched physical and visual perception on cognitive load and performance in an AR touching task by varying the physical fidelity (matching vs. non-matching physical shape) and visual mechanism (projector-based vs. HMD-based AR) of the representation. Participants touched visual targets on four corresponding physical-visual representations of a human head. We evaluated their performance in terms of touch accuracy, response time, and a cognitive load task requiring target size estimations during a concurrent (secondary) counting task. After each condition, participants completed questionnaires concerning mental, physical, and temporal demands; stress; frustration; and usability. Results indicated higher performance, lower cognitive load, and increased usability when participants touched a matching physical head-shaped surface and when visuals were provided by a projector from underneath.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "authors": ["Jason Hochreiter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hochreiter:Jason", "Salam Daher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daher:Salam", "Gerd Bruder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruder:Gerd", "Greg Welch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welch:Greg"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
