{"title": "Effective blame for information-flow violations.", "fields": ["blame", "requirements engineering", "dependency graph", "constraint satisfaction problem", "operationalization"], "abstract": "Programs trusted with secure information should not release that information in ways contrary to system policy. However, when a program contains an illegal flow of information, current information-flow reporting techniques are inadequate for determining the cause of the error. Reasoning about information-flow errors can be difficult, as the flows involved can be quite subtle. We present a general model for  information-flow blame  that can explain the source of such security errors in code. This model is implemented by changing the information-flow verification procedure to: (1) generate supplementary information to reveal otherwise hidden program dependencies; (2) modify the constraint solver to construct a blame dependency graph; and (3) develop an explanation procedure that returns a  complete  and  minimal  error report. Our experiments show that information-flow errors can generally be explained and resolved by viewing only a small fraction of the total code.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of California, Berkeley", "The Pennyslvani ... ersity Park, PA", "The Pennyslvani ... ersity Park, PA"], "authors": ["Dave King.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/King_0002:Dave", "Trent Jaeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaeger:Trent", "Somesh Jha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jha:Somesh", "Sanjit A.
