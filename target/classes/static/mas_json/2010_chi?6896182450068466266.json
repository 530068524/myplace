To support both of these, the task concept needs to be introduced into a browser. An online pilot survey has revealed which attributes of the task concept are most significant to Web users and as a result a simple prototype, the Multitasking Bar (MB), is proposed based on these findings. The MB copes with the multitasking needs of both MT and MST in the browser by providing functions for task related Web page management and task schedule management. A two-session controlled experiment has been conducted to evaluate the MB and to compare user performance and experience when multitasking on the Web with and without support for MT and MST. Results show that support for both MST and MT significantly improves user task performance efficiency and greatly enhances the user experience when multitasking on the Web.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Qing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qing", "Huiyou Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Huiyou"], "pages": 10}
