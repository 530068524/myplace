{"title": "Learning From Collective Human Behavior to Introduce Diversity in Lexical Choice.", "fields": ["ranking", "natural language processing", "lexical choice", "leverage", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "We analyze collective discourse, a collective human behavior in content generation, and show that it exhibits diversity, a property of general collective systems. Using extensive analysis, we propose a novel paradigm for designing summary generation systems that reflect the diversity of perspectives seen in reallife collective summarization. We analyze 50 sets of summaries written by human about the same story or artifact and investigate the diversity of perspectives across these summaries. We show how different summaries use various phrasal information units (i.e., nuggets) to express the same atomic semantic units, called factoids. Finally, we present a ranker that employs distributional similarities to build a network of words, and captures the diversity of perspectives by detecting communities in this network. Our experiments show how our system outperforms a wide range of other document ranking systems that leverage diversity.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Vahed Qazvinian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qazvinian:Vahed", "Dragomir R.
