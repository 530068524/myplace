{"title": "SleepScale: Runtime joint speed scaling and sleep states management for power efficient data centers.", "fields": ["data center", "power management", "exploit", "workload", "system model"], "abstract": "Power consumption in data centers has been growing significantly in recent years. To reduce power, servers are beingequipped with increasingly sophisticated power management mechanisms. Different mechanisms offer dramatically different trade-offs between power savings and performance penalties. Considering the complexity, variety, and temporallyvarying nature of the applications hosted in a typical data center, intelligently determining which power management policy to use and when is a complicated task.   In this paper we analyze a system model featuring both performance scaling and low-power states. We reveal the interplay between performance scaling and low-power states via intensive simulation and analytic verification. Based on the observations, we present SleepScale, a runtime power management tool designed to efficiently exploit existing power control mechanisms. At run time, SleepScale characterizes power consumption and quality-of-service (QoS) for each lowpower state and frequency setting, and selects the best policy for a given QoS constraint. We evaluate SleepScale using workload traces from data centers and achieve significant power savings relative to conventional power management strategies", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Toronto", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Yanpei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yanpei", "Stark C.
