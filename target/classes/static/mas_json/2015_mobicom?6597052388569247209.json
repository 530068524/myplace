{"title": "Understanding and Modeling of WiFi Signal Based Human Activity Recognition.", "fields": ["machine learning", "activity recognition", "profiling", "distributed computing", "simulation"], "abstract": "Some pioneer WiFi signal based human activity recognition systems have been proposed. Their key limitation lies in the lack of a model that can quantitatively correlate CSI dynamics and human activities. In this paper, we propose CARM, a CSI based human Activity Recognition and Monitoring system. CARM has two theoretical underpinnings: a CSI-speed model, which quantifies the correlation between CSI value dynamics and human movement speeds, and a CSI-activity model, which quantifies the correlation between the movement speeds of different human body parts and a specific human activity. By these two models, we quantitatively build the correlation between CSI value dynamics and a specific human activity. CARM uses this correlation as the profiling mechanism and recognizes a given activity by matching it to the best-fit profile. We implemented CARM using commercial WiFi devices and evaluated it in several different environments. Our results show that CARM achieves an average accuracy of greater than 96%.", "citation": "Citations (213)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Wei", "Alex X.
