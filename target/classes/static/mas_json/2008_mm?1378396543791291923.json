{"title": "Contextual navigation in a multimedia journal.", "fields": ["file format", "multimedia framework", "journaling file system", "software portability", "software"], "abstract": "This work presents a framework for multimedia journaling, maintaining strong relationships between the document and embedded media. This enables media archives that are robust to changes in software environments, such as changes in web-sharing services, proprietary file formats and enables portability across operating system. We develop a journaling application using an existing multimedia framework, and show the power of the paradigm with specific case studies.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Curtin University", "Curtin University"], "authors": ["Stewart Greenhill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenhill:Stewart", "Svetha Venkatesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkatesh:Svetha"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
