In the case of reasoning about relative likelihood, with statements of the form \u03c6 \u2265 \u03c8 expressing that \u03c6 is at least as likely as \u03c8, a standard qualitative approach using preordered preferential structures yields a dramatically different logical system than a quantitative ap- proach using probability measures. In fact, the standard pref- erential approach validates principles of reasoning that are incorrect from a probabilistic point of view. However, in this paper we show that a natural modification of the preferential approach yields exactly the same logical system as a probabilistic approach\u2014not using single probability measures, but rather sets of probability measures. Thus, the same preferential structures used in the study of non-monotonic logics and belief revision may be used in the study of comparative probabilistic reasoning based on imprecise probabilities.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Matthew Harrison-Trainor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison=Trainor:Matthew", "Wesley H.
