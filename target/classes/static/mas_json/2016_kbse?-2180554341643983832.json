{"title": "Verifying simulink stateflow model: timed automata approach.", "fields": ["timer", "synchronization", "semantics", "formal semantics", "stateflow"], "abstract": "Simulink Stateflow is widely used for the model-driven development of software. However, the increasing demand of rigorous verification for safety critical applications brings new challenge to the Simulink Stateflow because of the lack of formal semantics. In this paper, we present STU, a self-contained toolkit to bridge the Simulink Stateflow and a well-defined rigorous verification. The tool translates the Simulink Stateflow into the Uppaal timed automata for verification. Compared to existing work, more advanced and complex modeling features in Stateflow such as the event stack, conditional action and timer are supported. Then, with the strong verification power of Uppaal, we can not only find design defects that are missed by the Simulink Design Verifier, but also check more important temporal properties. The evaluation on artificial examples and real industrial applications demonstrates the effectiveness.
