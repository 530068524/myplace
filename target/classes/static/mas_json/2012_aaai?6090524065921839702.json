Agent-human coordination is becoming even more important in real life situations, where uncertainty and incomplete information exists and communication is costly. While abundant research has focused on aspects of computerized teamwork, little attention has been given to the issues raised in teams that consist of both computerized agents and people. In this paper we focus on teamwork between an agent and a human counterpart and present a novel agent designed to interact proficiently with people. In extensive simulations we matched our agent with people and compared it with another state-of-the-art agent. Our results demonstrate the significant improvement in coordination when our agent is involved.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Asaf Frieder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frieder:Asaf", "Raz Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Raz", "Sarit Kraus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraus:Sarit"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
