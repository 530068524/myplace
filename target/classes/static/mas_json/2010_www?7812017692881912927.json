We are exploring the use of Linked Data in combination with the Open Provenance Model (OPM) and Social Web concepts to facilitate interactions between people and data in the context of a VRE. In this demo we present the ourSpaces VRE and outline the technologies used to link together provenance, research artefacts, projects, geographical locations and social data in the context of interdisciplinary research.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Aberdeen", "University of Aberdeen", "University of Aberdeen", "University of Aberdeen"], "authors": ["Richard Reid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reid:Richard", "Edoardo Pignotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pignotti:Edoardo", "Peter Edwards.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edwards:Peter", "Adele Laing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laing:Adele"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
