Via a survey (n = 200), we detail current practices in seeking remote shopping advice. We then consider how emerging social platforms, such as social networking sites and crowd labor markets, could offer rich next-generation remote shopping advice experiences. We conducted a field experiment in which shoppers shared photographs of potential purchases via MMS, Facebook, and Mechanical Turk. Paid crowdsourcing, in particular, proved surprisingly useful and influential as a means of augmenting in-store shopping. Based on our findings, we offer design suggestions for next-generation remote shopping advice systems.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Meredith Ringel Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Meredith_Ringel", "Kori Inkpen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inkpen:Kori", "Gina Venolia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venolia:Gina"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
