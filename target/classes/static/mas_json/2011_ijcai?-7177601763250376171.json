{"title": "On the Decidability of Connectedness Constraints in 2D and 3D Euclidean Spaces.", "fields": ["social connectedness", "undecidable problem", "closed set", "boolean domain", "predicate functor logic"], "abstract": "We investigate (quantifier-free) spatial constraint languages with equality, contact and connectedness predicates, as well as Boolean operations on regions, interpreted over low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. We show that the complexity of reasoning varies dramatically depending on the dimension of the space and on the type of regions considered. For example, the logic with the interior-connectedness predicate (and without contact) is undecidable over polygons or regular closed sets in R2, EXPTIME-complete over polyhedra in R3, and NP-complete over regular closed sets in R3.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Birkbeck, University of London", "University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "Birkbeck, University of London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Roman Kontchakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontchakov:Roman", "Yavor Nenov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nenov:Yavor", "Ian Pratt-Hartmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pratt=Hartmann:Ian", "Michael Zakharyaschev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zakharyaschev:Michael"], "pages": 6}
