This is due to their ability to motivate, as well as intrinsic large number of movement repetitions that are keys to inducing brain plasticity and facilitating recovery. Unfortunately, bi-manual therapy, while potentially more efficacious, is less developed at this time. The novel RABIT system combines physical and cognitive training in integrative game-play sessions. Using the Razer Hydra game interface, the patients playa series of custom games designed to improve focusing, decision making (executive function), short-term and long-term memory, progressing in difficulty over 6 weeks of therapy.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Grigore C.
