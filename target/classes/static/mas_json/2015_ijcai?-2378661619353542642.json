{"title": "Personalized Sentiment Classification Based on Latent Individuality of Microblog Users.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "microblogging", "classifier", "dependency grammar", "statistical classification"], "abstract": "Sentiment expression in microblog posts often reflects user's specific individuality due to different language habit, personal character, opinion bias and so on. Existing sentiment classification algorithms largely ignore such latent personal distinctions among different microblog users. Meanwhile, sentiment data of microblogs are sparse for individual users, making it infeasible to learn effective personalized classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel, extensible personalized sentiment classification method based on a variant of latent factor model to capture personal sentiment variations by mapping users and posts into a low-dimensional factor space. We alleviate the sparsity of personal texts by decomposing the posts into words which are further represented by the weighted sentiment and topic units based on a set of syntactic units of words obtained from dependency parsing results. To strengthen the representation of users, we leverage users following relation to consolidate the individuality of a user fused from other users with similar interests. Results on real-world microblog datasets confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline algorithms with large margins.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Kaisong Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Kaisong", "Shi Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Shi", "Wei Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Wei", "Daling Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Daling", "Ge Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Ge", "Kam-Fai Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Kam=Fai"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
