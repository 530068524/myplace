Our approach allows for an easy and precise selection of the time that is of interest and provides immediate feedback to the users when interacting with it. It has been developed in an evolutionary process gaining formative feedback from end users.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Koblenz and Landau", "University of Koblenz and Landau", "University of Koblenz and Landau"], "authors": ["Daniel Schmei\u00df.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmei=szlig=:Daniel", "Ansgar Scherp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scherp:Ansgar", "Steffen Staab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Staab:Steffen"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
