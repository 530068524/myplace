{"title": "Scheduling of multicast and unicast services under limited feedback by using rateless codes.", "fields": ["xcast", "channel state information", "unicast", "multicast", "telecommunications link"], "abstract": "Many opportunistic scheduling techniques are impractical because they require accurate channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. In this paper, we investigate the scheduling of unicast and multicast services in a downlink network with a very limited amount of feedback information. Specifically, unicast users send imperfect (or no) CSI and infrequent acknowledgements (ACKs) to a base station, and multicast users only report infrequent ACKs to avoid feedback implosion. We consider the use of physical-layer rateless codes, which not only combats channel uncertainty, but also reduces the overhead of ACK feedback. A joint scheduling and power allocation scheme is developed to realize multiuser diversity gain for unicast service and multicast gain for multicast service. We prove that our scheme achieves a near-optimal throughput region. Our simulation results show that our scheme significantly improves the network throughput over schemes employing fixed-rate codes or using only unicast communications.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Hewlett-Packard", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Yin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yin", "Can Emre Koksal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koksal:Can_Emre", "Kyu-Han Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kyu=Han", "Ness B.
