This fact has recently motivated the sensorimotor approach to the challenging task of automatic object recognition, where both information sources are fused to improve robustness. In this work, the aforementioned paradigm is adopted, surpassing current limitations of sensorimotor object recognition research. Specifically, the deep learning paradigm is introduced to the problem for the first time, developing a number of novel neuro-biologically and neuro-physiologically inspired architectures that utilize state-of-the-art neural networks for fusing the available information sources in multiple ways. The proposed methods are evaluated using a large RGB-D corpus, which is specifically collected for the task of sensorimotor object recognition and is made publicly available. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of affordance information to object recognition, achieving an up to 29% relative error reduction by its inclusion.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Information Technology Institute", "Information Technology Institute", "Information Technology Institute", "University of Thessaly"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Spyridon Thermos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thermos:Spyridon", "Georgios Th.
