The system has been enhanced to provide more flexibility in the ways participants could organise themselves and the materials they are working on. Drawing on some quasi-naturalistic experiments, where the participants were required to undertake a range of complex tasks, we consider the formations they adopt and the issues and problems that arise when they attempt to establish and preserve a common focus and alignment. We conclude by briefly discussing the consequences for developing advanced spaces to support collaborative work and understanding complex video-mediated interaction.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["King's College London", "University of Tsukuba", "King's College London", "NTT Communicati ... n, Kyoto, Japan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Paul K.
