{"title": "Swift: Compiled Inference for Probabilistic Programming Languages.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "inference engine", "swift", "ranging", "compiler"], "abstract": "A probabilistic program defines a probability measure over its semantic structures. One common goal of probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) is to compute posterior probabilities for arbitrary models and queries, given observed evidence, using a generic inference engine. Most PPL inference engines--even the compiled ones--incur significant runtime interpretation overhead, especially for contingent and open-universe models. This paper describes Swift, a compiler for the BLOG PPL. Swift-generated code incorporates optimizations that eliminate interpretation overhead, maintain dynamic dependencies efficiently, and handle memory management for possible worlds of varying sizes. Experiments comparing Swift with other PPL engines on a variety of inference problems demonstrate speedups ranging from 12x to 326x.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Washington", "Toutiao.com"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yi", "Lei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Lei", "Stuart J.
