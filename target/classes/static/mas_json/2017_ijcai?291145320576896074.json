This paper introduces a semi-supervised learning algorithm that is capable of selecting the most informative instances and maximizing the influence of expert labels. Specifically, we have developed a complete uncertainty assessment to facilitate the selection of the most informative instances. The expert labels are then propagated to similar instances via regularized Bayesian inference. Experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets indicate that given a specific accuracy goal (e.g., 95%), our method reduces expert effort from 39% to 60% compared with the state-of-the-art method.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Mengchen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Mengchen", "Liu Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Liu", "Junlin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Junlin", "Xiting Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiting", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Shixia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shixia"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
