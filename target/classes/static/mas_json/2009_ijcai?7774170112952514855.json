In this paper, we propose an omni-view learning approach to enable learning from multiple data collections. The theme is to organize heterogeneous data sources into a unified table with global data view. To achieve the omni-view learning goal, we consider that the objective dataset and the auxiliary datasets share some instance-level dependency structures. We then propose a relational k-means to cluster instances in each auxiliary dataset, such that clusters can help build new features to capture correlations between the objective and auxiliary datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that omni-view learning can help build models which outperform the ones learned from the objective dataset only. Comparisons with the co-training algorithm further assert that omni-view learning provides an alternative, yet effective, way for semi-supervised learning.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "Kent State University"], "authors": ["Xingquan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xingquan", "Ruoming Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Ruoming"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
