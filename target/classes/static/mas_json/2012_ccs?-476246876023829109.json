{"title": "Touching from a distance: website fingerprinting attacks and defenses.", "fields": ["anonymity", "overhead", "web page", "provable security", "traffic analysis"], "abstract": "We present a novel web page fingerprinting attack that is able to defeat several recently proposed defenses against traffic analysis attacks, including the application-level defenses HTTPOS and randomized pipelining over Tor. Regardless of the defense scheme, our attack was able to guess which of 100 web pages a victim was visiting at least 50% of the time and, with some defenses, over 90% of the time. Our attack is based on a simple model of network behavior and out-performs previously proposed ad hoc attacks. We then build a web site fingerprinting attack that is able to identify whether a victim is visiting a particular web site with over 90% accuracy in our experiments.   Our results strongly suggest that ad hoc defenses against traffic analysis are not likely to succeed. Consequently, we describe a defense scheme that provides provable security properties, albeit with potentially higher overheads.", "citation": "Citations (194)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Xiang Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Xiang", "Xin Cheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xin_Cheng", "Brijesh Joshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joshi:Brijesh", "Rob Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Rob"], "pages": 12}
