{"title": "Traffic management: a holistic approach to memory placement on NUMA systems.", "fields": ["multi core processor", "system software", "cache only memory architecture", "non uniform memory access", "thread"], "abstract": "NUMA systems are characterized by Non-Uniform Memory Access times, where accessing data in a remote node takes longer than a local access. NUMA hardware has been built since the late 80's, and the operating systems designed for it were optimized for access locality. They co-located memory pages with the threads that accessed them, so as to avoid the cost of remote accesses. Contrary to older systems, modern NUMA hardware has much smaller remote wire delays, and so remote access costs per se are not the main concern for performance, as we discovered in this work. Instead,  congestion on memory controllers and interconnects , caused by memory traffic from data-intensive applications, hurts performance a lot more. Because of that, memory placement algorithms must be redesigned to target traffic congestion. This requires an arsenal of techniques that go beyond optimizing locality. In this paper we describe  Carrefour , an algorithm that addresses this goal. We implemented  Carrefour  in Linux and obtained performance improvements of up to 3.6 relative to the default kernel, as well as significant improvements compared to NUMA-aware patchsets available for Linux.  Carrefour  never hurts performance by more than 4% when memory placement cannot be improved. We present the design of  Carrefour , the challenges of implementing it on modern hardware, and draw insights about hardware support that would help optimize system software on future NUMA systems.", "citation": "Citations (191)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "UJF, Grenoble, France"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Mohammad Dashti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dashti:Mohammad", "Alexandra Fedorova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fedorova:Alexandra", "Justin R.
