{"title": "Latency-Tolerant Software Distributed Shared Memory.", "fields": ["latency", "spark", "throughput", "distributed shared memory", "software"], "abstract": "We present Grappa, a modern take on software distributed shared memory (DSM) for in-memory data-intensive applications. Grappa enables users to program a cluster as if it were a single, large, non-uniform memory access (NUMA) machine. Performance scales up even for applications that have poor locality and input-dependent load distribution. Grappa addresses deficiencies of previous DSM systems by exploiting application parallelism, trading off latency for throughput. We evaluate Grappa with an in-memory MapReduce framework (10\u00d7 faster than Spark [74]); a vertex-centric framework inspired by GraphLab (1.33\u00d7 faster than native GraphLab [48]); and a relational query execution engine (12.5\u00d7 faster than Shark [31]). All these frameworks required only 60-690 lines of Grappa code.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Jacob Nelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nelson:Jacob", "Brandon Holt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holt:Brandon", "Brandon Myers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Myers:Brandon", "Preston Briggs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Briggs:Preston", "Luis Ceze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceze:Luis", "Simon Kahan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kahan:Simon", "Mark Oskin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oskin:Mark"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2015", "pages": 15}
