{"title": "zUpdate: updating data center networks with zero loss.", "fields": ["openflow", "data center", "asynchronous communication", "testbed", "synchronizing"], "abstract": "Datacenter networks (DCNs) are constantly evolving due to various updates such as switch upgrades and VM migrations. Each update must be carefully planned and executed in order to avoid disrupting many of the mission-critical, interactive applications hosted in DCNs. The key challenge arises from the inherent difficulty in synchronizing the changes to many devices, which may result in unforeseen transient link load spikes or even congestions. We present one primitive, zUpdate, to perform congestion-free network updates under asynchronous switch and traffic matrix changes. We formulate the update problem using a network model and apply our model to a variety of representative update scenarios in DCNs. We develop novel techniques to handle several practical challenges in realizing zUpdate as well as implement the zUpdate prototype on OpenFlow switches and deploy it on a testbed that resembles real DCN topology. Our results, from both real-world experiments and large-scale trace-driven simulations, show that zUpdate can effectively perform congestion-free updates in production DCNs.", "citation": "Citations (155)", "departments": ["Yale University", "Duke University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Hongqiang Harry Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hongqiang_Harry", "Xin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xin", "Ming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Ming", "Lihua Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Lihua", "Roger Wattenhofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wattenhofer:Roger", "David A.
