In gradient matching a separate data model is introduced with the property that its gradient may be calculated easily. Parameter estimation is then achieved by requiring consistency between the gradients computed from the data model and those specified by the ODE. We propose a Gaussian process model that directly links state derivative information with system observations, simplifying previous approaches and improving estimation accuracy.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Laval University", "University College London"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["David Barber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barber:David", "Yali Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yali"], "pages": 9}
