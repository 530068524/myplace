This study tried to understand how users manipulate digital content on a distant screen by hand gesture interaction in a living room environment. While there have been many existing studies that investigate freehand input techniques, we developed and applied a novel study methodology based on a combination of both an existing user elicitation study and conventional Wizard-of-Oz study that involved another non-technical user for providing feedback. Through the study, many useful issues and implications for making freehand gesture interaction design more natural in a living room environment were generated which have not been covered in previous works. Furthermore, we could observe how the initial user-defined gestures are changed over time.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Sang-Su Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sang=Su", "Jeonghun Chae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chae:Jeonghun", "Hyunjeong Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyunjeong", "Youn-Kyung Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Youn=Kyung", "Kun-Pyo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kun=Pyo"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
