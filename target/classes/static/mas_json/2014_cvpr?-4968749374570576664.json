{"title": "Dense Semantic Image Segmentation with Objects and Attributes.", "fields": ["segmentation based object categorization", "hierarchical database model", "visual appearance", "scale space segmentation", "boosting"], "abstract": "The concepts of objects and attributes are both important for describing images precisely, since verbal descriptions often contain both adjectives and nouns (e.g. 'I see a shiny red chair'). In this paper, we formulate the problem of joint visual attribute and object class image segmentation as a dense multi-labelling problem, where each pixel in an image can be associated with both an object-class and a set of visual attributes labels. In order to learn the label correlations, we adopt a boosting-based piecewise training approach with respect to the visual appearance and co-occurrence cues. We use a filtering-based mean-field approximation approach for efficient joint inference. Further, we develop a hierarchical model to incorporate region-level object and attribute information. Experiments on the aPASCAL, CORE and attribute augmented NYU indoor scenes datasets show that the proposed approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art results.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Oxford Brookes University", "Oxford Brookes University", "Oxford Brookes University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shuai Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0001:Shuai", "Ming-Ming Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Ming=Ming", "Jonathan Warrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Warrell:Jonathan", "Paul Sturgess.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sturgess:Paul", "Vibhav Vineet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vineet:Vibhav", "Carsten Rother.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rother:Carsten", "Philip H.
