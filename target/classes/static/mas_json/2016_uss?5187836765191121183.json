In our previous work, we advocated the use of a general stable matching framework from economics to solve networking problems, and showed that it offers unique advantages compared to utility-based optimization, using a simple procedure of deferred acceptance. In this paper, we apply this framework to the VM migration problem, and propose an egalitarian approach that finds a stable matching fair to both VMs and servers, instead of favoring either side as a result of the deferred acceptance procedure. Such an egalitarian stable matching that minimizes the total rank sum of the outcome is shown to be a sensible notion of fairness under mild conditions, and through simulations is demonstrated to offer superior results.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Alex Biryukov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biryukov:Alex", "Dmitry Khovratovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khovratovich:Dmitry"], "pages": 12}
