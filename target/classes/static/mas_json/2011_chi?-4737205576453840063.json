The input granularity can be controlled in a natural way by varying the amount of cloth pinched. Pinstripe input elements physically consist of fields of parallel conductive lines sewn onto the fabric. This way, they can be invisible, and can be included across large areas of a garment. Pinstripe also addresses several problems previously identified in the placement and operation of textile UI elements on smart clothing. Two user studies evaluate ideal placement and orientation of Pinstripe elements on the users' garments as well as acceptance and perceived ease of use of this novel textile input technique.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Thorsten Karrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karrer:Thorsten", "Moritz Wittenhagen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wittenhagen:Moritz", "Leonhard Lichtschlag.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lichtschlag:Leonhard", "Florian Heller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heller:Florian", "Jan O.
