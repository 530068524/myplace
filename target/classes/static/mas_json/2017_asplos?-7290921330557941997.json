We demonstrate that superoptimization can dramatically improve the performance of Google Native Client, a SFI system that ships inside the Google Chrome Browser. Key to our results are new techniques for superoptimization of loops: we propose a new architecture for superoptimization tools that incorporates both a fully sound verification technique to ensure correctness and a bounded verification technique to guide the search to optimized code. In our evaluation we optimize 13 libc string functions, formally verify the correctness of the optimizations and report a median and average speedup of 25% over the libraries shipped by Google.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Microsoft", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Berkeley R.
