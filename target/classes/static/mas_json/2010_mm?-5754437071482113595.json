In order to improve user experience and device usability, the design of interfaces and interaction techniques for mobile devices have focused on new modalities, other than those used for desktop computers. In this paper, we describe a novel gesture controlled video player interface for mobile devices. The results of a usability study confirm that users would definitely like to adopt the major part of the proposed features. Furthermore, the responsiveness and reliability of the interface has been studied. Measured response times have been found to be within acceptable boundaries and the number of unrecognised haptic controls is limited.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Vienna", "University of Vienna", "University of Vienna", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Shelley Buchinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buchinger:Shelley", "Ewald Hotop.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hotop:Ewald", "Helmut Hlavacs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hlavacs:Helmut", "Francesca De Simone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simone:Francesca_De", "Touradj Ebrahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ebrahimi:Touradj"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
