{"title": "On the total variation distance of labelled Markov chains.", "fields": ["arbitrary precision arithmetic", "almost surely", "total variation", "equivalence", "probabilistic logic"], "abstract": "Labelled Markov chains (LMCs) are widely used in probabilistic verification, speech recognition, computational biology, and many other fields. Checking two LMCs for equivalence is a classical problem subject to extensive studies, while the total variation distance provides a natural measure for the \"inequivalence\" of two LMCs: it is the maximum difference between probabilities that the LMCs assign to the same event.   In this paper we develop a theory of the total variation distance between two LMCs, with emphasis on the algorithmic aspects: (1) we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether two LMCs have distance 1, i.e., whether they can almost always be distinguished; (2) we provide an algorithm for approximating the distance with arbitrary precision; and (3) we show that the threshold problem, i.e., whether the distance exceeds a given threshold, is NP-hard and hard for the square-root-sum problem. We also make a connection between the total variation distance and  Bernoulli convolutions .", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Middlesex University", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Taolue Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Taolue", "Stefan Kiefer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiefer:Stefan"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
