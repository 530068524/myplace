{"title": "Bolt: Anonymous Payment Channels for Decentralized Currencies.", "fields": ["fork", "business", "ledger", "intermediary", "computer security", "micropayment", "dispute resolution", "payment", "channel"], "abstract": "Bitcoin owes its success to the fact that transactions are transparently recorded in the blockchain, a global public ledger that removes the need for trusted parties. Unfortunately, recording every transaction in the blockchain causes privacy, latency, and scalability issues. Building on recent proposals for \"micropayment channels\" --- two party associations that use the ledger only for dispute resolution --- we introduce techniques for constructing  anonymous  payment channels. Our proposals allow for secure, instantaneous and private payments that substantially reduce the storage burden on the payment network. Specifically, we introduce three channel proposals, including a technique that allows payments via untrusted intermediaries. We build a concrete implementation of our scheme and show that it can be deployed via a soft fork to existing anonymous currencies such as ZCash.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Matthew Green.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Green_0001:Matthew", "Ian Miers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miers:Ian"], "pages": 17}
