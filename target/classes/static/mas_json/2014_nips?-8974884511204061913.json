We propose a novel prior formulation, the structured spike and slab prior, which allows to incorporate a priori knowledge of the sparsity pattern by imposing a spatial Gaussian process on the spike and slab probabilities. Thus, prior information on the structure of the sparsity pattern can be encoded using generic covariance functions. Furthermore, we provide a Bayesian inference scheme for the proposed model based on the expectation propagation framework. Using numerical experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate the benefits of the model.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Technical University of Denmark", "Technical University of Denmark", "Technical University of Denmark"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Michael Riis Andersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andersen:Michael_Riis", "Ole Winther.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winther:Ole", "Lars Kai Hansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hansen:Lars_Kai"], "pages": 9}
