{"title": "Analyzing Unsynthesizable Specifications for High-Level Robot Behavior Using LTLMoP.", "fields": ["behavior based robotics", "robot control", "robotics", "frustration", "automated reasoning"], "abstract": "Recent work in robotics has applied formal verification tools to automatically generate correct-by-construction controllers for autonomous robots. However, when it is not possible to create such a controller, these approaches do not provide the user with feedback on the source of failure, making the experience of debugging a specification somewhat ad hoc and unstructured, and a source of frustration for the user. This paper describes an extension to the LTLMoP toolkit for robot mission planning that encloses the control-generation process in a layer of automated reasoning to identify the cause of failure, and targets the users attention to flawed portions of the specification.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Vasumathi Raman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raman:Vasumathi", "Hadas Kress-Gazit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kress=Gazit:Hadas"], "pages": 6}
