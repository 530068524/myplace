{"title": "Key-segments for video object segmentation.", "fields": ["ranking", "segmentation", "feature extraction", "image segmentation", "region of interest"], "abstract": "We present an approach to discover and segment foreground object(s) in video. Given an unannotated video sequence, the method first identifies object-like regions in any frame according to both static and dynamic cues. We then compute a series of binary partitions among those candidate \u201ckey-segments\u201d to discover hypothesis groups with persistent appearance and motion. Finally, using each ranked hypothesis in turn, we estimate a pixel-level object labeling across all frames, where (a) the foreground likelihood depends on both the hypothesis's appearance as well as a novel localization prior based on partial shape matching, and (b) the background likelihood depends on cues pulled from the key-segments' (possibly diverse) surroundings observed across the sequence. Compared to existing methods, our approach automatically focuses on the persistent foreground regions of interest while resisting oversegmentation. We apply our method to challenging benchmark videos, and show competitive or better results than the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (368)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yong Jae Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yong_Jae", "Jaechul Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jaechul", "Kristen Grauman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grauman:Kristen"], "pages": 8}
