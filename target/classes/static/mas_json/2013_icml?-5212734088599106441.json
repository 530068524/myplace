When the number of labels grows to the hundreds or even thousands, existing multi-label classification methods often become computationally inefficient. In recent years, a number of remedies have been proposed. However, they are based either on simple dimension reduction techniques or involve expensive optimization problems. In this paper, we address this problem by selecting a small subset of class labels that can approximately span the original label space. This is performed by an efficient randomized sampling procedure where the sampling probability of each class label re flects its importance among all the labels. Experiments on a number of real-world multi-label data sets with many labels demonstrate the appealing performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Wei Bi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bi:Wei", "James Tin-Yau Kwok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwok:James_Tin=Yau"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
