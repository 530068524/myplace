While their formalism is quite general, it is restricted to fluents whose values are drawn from discrete countable domains, as opposed to the continuous domains seen in many robotic applications. In this paper, we show how this limitation in their approach can be lifted. By dealing seamlessly with both discrete distributions and continuous densities within a rich theory of action, we provide a very general logical specification of how belief should change after acting and sensing in complex noisy domains.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Vaishak Belle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belle:Vaishak", "Hector J.
