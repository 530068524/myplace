Most of previous approaches generate dictionaries by unsupervised clustering techniques, e.g. k-means. However, the features obtained by such kind of dictionaries may not be optimal for image classification. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for supervised dictionary learning (SDLM) which seamlessly combines an unsuper-vised model (a Gaussian Mixture Model) and a supervised model (a logistic regression model) in a probabilistic framework. In the model, image category information directly affects the generation of a dictionary. A dictionary obtained by this approach is a trade-off between minimization of distortions of clusters and maximization of discriminative power of image-wise representations, i.e. histogram representations of images. We further extend the model to incorporate spatial information during the dictionary learning process in a spatial pyramid matching like manner. We extensively evaluated the two models on various benchmark dataset and obtained promising results.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xiao-Chen Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Xiao=Chen", "Zhiwei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhiwei", "Changhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Changhu", "Bao-Liang Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Bao=Liang", "Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lei"], "pages": 8}
