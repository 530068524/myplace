Unfortunately, road networks change frequently. Consequently, we study the issue of automatic map update in this paper. We propose a system called COBWEB which takes all the unmatched trajectories as input and generates the missing road segments with both the geometry properties and topology features well preserved. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study via real trajectory data generated by roughly 15,000 taxis in Singapore within a 5-month period. Compared with existing work, COBWEB demonstrates a better and more stable performance and a stronger resilience to various sampling rates and data sizes.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Singapore Management University"], "authors": ["Zhangqing Shan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shan:Zhangqing", "Hao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0011:Hao", "Weiwei Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Weiwei", "Baihua Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Baihua"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
