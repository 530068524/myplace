Up-to techniques have been introduced as enhancements of coinduction, an abstract principle to prove properties expressed via greatest fixed-points.   While abstract interpretation is always sound by definition, the soundness of up-to techniques needs some ingenuity to be proven. For completeness, the setting is switched: up-to techniques are always complete, while abstract domains are not.   In this work we show that, under reasonable assumptions, there is an evident connection between sound up-to techniques and complete abstract domains.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Pisa", "IMDEA", "IMDEA", "University of Hawaii"], "authors": ["Filippo Bonchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonchi:Filippo", "Pierre Ganty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganty:Pierre", "Roberto Giacobazzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giacobazzi:Roberto", "Dusko Pavlovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pavlovic:Dusko"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
