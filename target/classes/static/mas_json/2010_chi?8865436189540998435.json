Such exploratory settings provide for a rich educational environment for students, but they challenge teachers to keep track of students\u2019 progress and to assess their performance. This article presents techniques for recognizing students\u2019 activities in such pedagogical software and visualizing these activities to teachers. It describes a new plan recognition algorithm that uses a recursive grammar that takes into account repetition and interleaving of activities. This algorithm was evaluated empirically using an exploratory environment for teaching chemistry used by thousands of students in several countries. It was always able to correctly infer students\u2019 plans when the appropriate grammar was available. We designed two methods for visualizing students\u2019 activities for teachers: one that visualizes students\u2019 inferred plans, and one that visualizes students\u2019 interactions over a timeline. Both of these visualization methods were preferred to and found more helpful than a baseline method which showed a movie of students\u2019 interactions. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining novel AI techniques and visualization methods for the purpose of designing collaborative systems that support students in their problem solving and teachers in their understanding of students\u2019 performance.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Wilfrid Laurier University", "Wilfrid Laurier University", "Centre for Research on Inner City Health", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "University of Toronto", "Avaya", "Avaya", "Avaya", "Avaya", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro", "LET'S POWOW LIM ...
