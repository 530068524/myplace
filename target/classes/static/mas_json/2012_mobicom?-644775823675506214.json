{"title": "Can we pay for what we get in 3G data access?", "fields": ["operator", "enforcement", "cellular network", "data access", "traffic volume"], "abstract": "Data-plan subscribers are charged based on the used traffic volume in 3G/4G cellular networks. This usage-based charging system has been operational and received general success. In this work, we conduct experiments to critically assess both this usage-based accounting architecture and application-specific charging policies by operators. Our evaluation compares the network-recorded volume with the delivered traffic at the end device. We have found that, both generally work in common scenarios but may go wrong in the extreme cases: We are charged for what we never get, and we can get what we want for free. In one extreme case, we are charged for at least three hours and 450MB or more data despite receiving no single bit. In another extreme case, we are able to transfer 200MB or any amount we specify for free. The root causes lie in lack of both coordination between the charging system and the end device, and prudent policy enforcement by certain operators. We propose immediate fixes and discuss possible future directions.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Chunyi Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Chunyi", "Guan-Hua Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Guan=Hua", "Chi-Yu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chi=Yu", "Songwu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Songwu"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
