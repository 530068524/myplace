This work focuses on the role of the integrator and investigates working habits and challenges alike. We set up an exploratory qualitative study involving a large-scale survey involving 749 integrators, to which we add quantitative data from the integrator\u2019s project. Our results provide insights into the factors they consider in their decision making process to accept or reject a contribution. Our key findings are that integrators struggle to maintain the quality of their projects and have difficulties with prioritizing contributions that are to be merged.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": [], "authors": ["Georgios Gousios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gousios:Georgios", "Andy Zaidman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaidman:Andy", "Margaret-Anne D.
