In an inverted classroom, typical in-class lecture time is replaced with laboratory and in-class activities. Outside class time, lectures are delivered over some other medium such as video on-demand. In a three credit hour course for instance, contact hours are spent having students actively engaged in learning activities. Outside of class, students are focused on viewing 3-6 hours of lectures per week. Additional time outside of class is spent completing learning activities. In this paper we present the inverted classroom model in the context of a software engineering curriculum. The paper motivates the use of the inverted classroom and suggests how different courses from the Software Engineering 2004 Model Curriculum Volume can incorporate the use of the inverted classroom. In addition, we present the results of a pilot course that utilized the inverted classroom model at Miami University and describe courses that are currently in process of piloting its use.", "citation": "Citations (360)", "departments": ["Miami University", "Miami University", "Miami University"], "authors": ["Gerald C.
