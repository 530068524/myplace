Slow Design is a design philosophy that focuses on promoting well-being for individuals, society, and the natural environment. It encourages people to do things at the right time and at the right speed which helps them to understand and reflect on their actions. Several authors have proposed Slow Design principles and cases have been reported in which these principles were applied in cultural design projects. These applications indicated that Slow Design can indeed have a positive impact on wellbeing. Although promising, this philosophy has not yet been used in the design of mass consumer products. In this paper we present a design case study in which we explored how the Slow Design principles can be applied in the design of an electric fruit juicer. Two studies are reported on where the conditions for implementing Slow Design are explored. The results led to a revision of the principles for use by product designers. The main finding from the case study is that the Slow Design principles can be used to create more 'mindful' interactions that stimulate positive user involvement. This is not from designing interactions that require more time per se, but by stimulating the user to use more time for those parts of the interaction that are meaningful and less for those that are not meaningful.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["Philips", "Philips", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Designit, Munich, Germany"], "authors": ["Barbara Grosse-Hering.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grosse=Hering:Barbara", "Jon Mason.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mason:Jon", "Dzmitry Aliakseyeu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aliakseyeu:Dzmitry", "Conny Bakker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bakker:Conny", "Pieter Desmet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desmet:Pieter"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
