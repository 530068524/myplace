The language's generality prohibits the development of a single analysis tool. It is proposed, instead, to leverage the existing analysis tools and create an analysis environment unified around the Rosetta language. A semi-automated tool, the Rosetta Nexus, will generated tool-specific analysis models and a correspondence with the original Rosetta specifications.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Kansas"], "authors": ["Nicolas Frisby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frisby:Nicolas"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
