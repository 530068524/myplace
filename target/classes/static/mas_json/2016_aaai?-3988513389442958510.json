Each item is described by a vector of attributes and for each attribute there is a desired distribution that the selected set should fit. We look for a set that fits as much as possible the desired distributions on all attributes. Examples of applications include choosing members of a representative committee, where candidates are described by attributes such as sex, age and profession, and where we look for a committee that for each attribute offers a certain representation, i.e., a single committee that contains a certain number of young and old people, certain number of men and women, certain number of people with different professions, etc. With a single attribute the problem boils down to the apportionment problem for party-list proportional representation systems (in such case the value of the single attribute is the political affiliation of a candidate). We study some properties of the associated subset selection rules, and address their computation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University", "University of Oxford", "Paris Dauphine University", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Piotr Krzysztof Skowron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skowron:Piotr_Krzysztof"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
