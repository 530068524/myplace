Compact-fit is a compacting memory management system for allocating, deallocating, and accessing memory in real time. The system provides predictable memory fragmentation and response times that are constant or linear in the size of the request, independently of the global memory state. We present two Compact-fit implementations and compare them to established memory management systems, which all fail to provide predictable memory fragmentation. The experiments confirm our theoretical complexity bounds and demonstrate competitive performance. In addition, we can control the performance versus fragmentation trade-off via our concept of partial compaction. The system can be parameterized with the needed level of compaction, improving the performance while keeping memory fragmentation predictable.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg"], "authors": ["Silviu S.
