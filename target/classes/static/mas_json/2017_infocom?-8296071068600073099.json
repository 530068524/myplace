{"title": "Rethinking CDN design with distributee time-varying traffic demands.", "fields": ["cache algorithms", "cache", "end user", "software deployment", "content delivery network"], "abstract": "The content delivery network (CDN) intensively uses cache to push the content close to end users. Over both traditional Internet architecture and emerging cloud-based framework, cache allocation has been the core problem that any CDN operator needs to address. As the first step for cache deployment, CDN operators need to discover or estimate the distribution of user requests in different geographic areas. This step results in a statistical spatial model for the user requests, which is used as the key input to solve the optimal cache deployment problem. More often than not, the temporal information in user requests is omitted to simplify the CDN design. In this paper, we disclose that the spatial request model alone may not lead to truly optimal cache deployment. By considering the temporal information in user requests, we provide a dynamic traffic based solution to this broadly studied problem. Via experiments over the North American ISPs Points of Presence (PoPs) network, our new solution outperforms traditional CDN design method and saves the overall delivery cost by 16% to 20%.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "Ericsson"], "authors": ["Guoming Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Guoming", "Kui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Kui", "Richard Brunner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brunner:Richard"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
