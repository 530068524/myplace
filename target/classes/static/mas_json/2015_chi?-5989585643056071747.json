{"title": "Long-Term Use of Motion-Based Video Games in Care Home Settings.", "fields": ["computer science", "multimedia", "long term care", "schedule"], "abstract": "Recent research suggests that motion-based video games have the potential to provide both mental and physical stimulation for older adults in residential care. However, little research has explored the practical challenges and opportunities that arise from integrating these games within existing schedules of activities in these contexts. In our work, we report on a qualitative enquiry that was conducted over a three month period at two long-term care facilities. Findings suggest that older adults enjoyed playing video games, and that games can be a valuable means of re-introducing challenge in late life, but that the impact of age-related changes and impairment can influence people's ability to engage with games in a group setting. We outline core challenges in the design for care context and discuss implications of our work regarding the suitability of games as a self-directed leisure activity.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Lincoln", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Lincoln"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kathrin Maria Gerling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerling:Kathrin_Maria", "Regan L.
