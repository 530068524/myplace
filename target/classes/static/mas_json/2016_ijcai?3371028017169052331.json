{"title": "Coco: Runtime Reasoning about Conflicting Commitments.", "fields": ["coco", "modeling language", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "To interact effectively, agents must enter into commitments. What should an agent do when these commitments conflict? We describe Coco, an approach for reasoning about which specific commitments apply to specific parties in light of general types of commitments, specific circumstances, and dominance relations among specific commitments. Coco adapts answer-set programming to identify a maximal set of nondominated commitments. It provides a modeling language and tool geared to support practical applications.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Nirav Ajmeri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ajmeri:Nirav", "Jiaming Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Jiaming", "Rada Chirkova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chirkova:Rada", "Jon Doyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doyle:Jon", "Munindar P.
