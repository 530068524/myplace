{"title": "Kaleido: You Can Watch It But Cannot Record It.", "fields": ["computer network", "visual communication", "computer science", "channel"], "abstract": "Recently a number of systems have been developed to implement and improve the visual communication over screen-camera links. In this paper we study an opposite problem: how to prevent unauthorized users from videotaping a video played on a screen, such as in a theater, while do not affect the viewing experience of legitimate audiences. We propose and develop a light-weight hardware-free system, called Kaleido, that ensures these properties by taking advantage of the limited disparities between the screen-eye channel and the screen-camera channel. Kaleido does not require any extra hardware and is purely based on re-encoding the original video frame into multiple frames used for displaying. We extensively test our system Kaleido using a variety of smartphone cameras. Our experiments confirm that Kaleido preserves the high-quality screen-eye channel while reducing the secondary screen-camera channel quality significantly.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "authors": ["Lan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lan", "Cheng Bo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bo:Cheng", "Jiahui Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:Jiahui", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Yu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Yu", "Kebin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Kebin", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2015", "pages": 14}
