It is concerned with natural resources, specially forests, and their preservation, through critical research and experimental artistic approaches. The project proposes multiplatform access to real-time networked\u00a0video and allows users to adopt selected forests under surveillance. The interactive system feeds a whole community that establishes connections by sharing \"the emotion of real-time\" and the challenge of uncertainty, while remotely monitoring natural environments for forests protection. This achievement enables artistic explorations with digital media in interactive installations that engage the audience senses in unconventional ways.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Lisbon", "Universidade Nova de Lisboa"], "authors": ["M\u00f3nica Mendes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mendes:M=oacute=nica", "Nuno Correia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Correia_0001:Nuno"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
