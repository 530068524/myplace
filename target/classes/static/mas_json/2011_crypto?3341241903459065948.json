{"title": "Pseudorandom Knapsacks and the Sample Complexity of LWE Search-to-Decision Reductions.", "fields": ["bounded function", "pseudorandomness", "knapsack problem", "pseudorandom number generator", "learning with errors"], "abstract": "We study the pseudorandomness of bounded knapsack functions over arbitrary finite abelian groups. Previous works consider only specific families of finite abelian groups and 0-1 coefficients. The main technical contribution of our work is a new, general theorem that provides sufficient conditions under which pseudorandomness of bounded knapsack functions follows directly from their one-wayness. Our results generalize and substantially extend previous work of Impagliazzo and Naor (J. Cryptology 1996).\n\nAs an application of the new theorem, we give sample preserving search-to-decision reductions for the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem, introduced by (Regev, STOC 2005) and widely used in lattice-based cryptography. Concretely, we show that, for a wide range of parameters, m LWE samples can be proved indistinguishable from random just under the hypothesis that search LWE is a one-way function for the same number m of samples.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Daniele Micciancio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micciancio:Daniele", "Petros Mol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mol:Petros"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2011", "pages": 20}
