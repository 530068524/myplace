Our algorithm runs in O (n^3/2 ) rounds in the Congest model, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. This is the first o(n^2) rounds deterministic distributed algorithm for the weighted APSP problem. Our algorithm is fairly simple and incorporates a deterministic distributed algorithm we develop for computing a 'blocker set' [King99], which has been used earlier in sequential dynamic computation of APSP.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Victoria", "Bell Labs", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "University of Vienna", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Chien-Chung Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chien=Chung", "Danupon Nanongkai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nanongkai:Danupon", "Thatchaphol Saranurak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saranurak:Thatchaphol"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
