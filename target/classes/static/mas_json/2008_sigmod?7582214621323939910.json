Due to the importance of those applications and the rapidly increasing amount of uncertain data collected and accumulated, analyzing large collections of uncertain data has become an important task and has attracted more and more interest from the database community. Recently, uncertain data management has become an emerging hot area in database research and development. In this tutorial, we systematically review some representative studies on answering various queries on uncertain and probabilistic data.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of New South Wales"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jian Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Jian", "Ming Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua_0001:Ming", "Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei", "Xuemin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xuemin"], "pages": 8}
