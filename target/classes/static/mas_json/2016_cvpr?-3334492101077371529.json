We propose a model that is based on decoding an image into a set of people detections. Our system takes an image as input and directly outputs a set of distinct detection hypotheses. Because we generate predictions jointly, common post-processing steps such as nonmaximum suppression are unnecessary. We use a recurrent LSTM layer for sequence generation and train our model end-to-end with a new loss function that operates on sets of detections. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging task of detecting people in crowded scenes1.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Russell Stewart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stewart:Russell", "Mykhaylo Andriluka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andriluka:Mykhaylo", "Andrew Y.
