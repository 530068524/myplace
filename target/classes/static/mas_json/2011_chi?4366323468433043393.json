Based on critiques of sustainable consumption and our findings, we reframe technology consumption as acquisition, possession, dispossession and reacquisition. We present four reacquisition orientations describing our participants' motivations and practices: casual, necessary, critical, and experiential. We then present a range of findings including issues with work, time and effort involved in reacquisition, and values and practices of care and patience associated with invested reacquirers. We conclude with implications for designing technologies to support current reacquisition practices, as well as broader opportunities for HCI and interaction design to incorporate non-mainstream reacquisition practices and values into more mainstream technologies.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["James Pierce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pierce:James", "Eric Paulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paulos:Eric"], "pages": 10}
