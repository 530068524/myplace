{"title": "Universal Option Models.", "fields": ["stochastic approximation", "controller", "expected return", "linear function", "bellman equation"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning models of options for real-time abstract planning, in the setting where reward functions can be specified at any time and their expected returns must be efficiently computed. We introduce a new model for an option that is independent of any reward function, called the universal option model (UOM). We prove that the UOM of an option can construct a traditional option model given a reward function, and also supports efficient computation of the option-conditional return. We extend the UOM to linear function approximation, and we show the UOM gives the TD solution of option returns and the value function of a policy over options. We provide a stochastic approximation algorithm for incrementally learning UOMs from data and prove its consistency. We demonstrate our method in two domains. The first domain is a real-time strategy game, where the controller must select the best game unit to accomplish a dynamically-specified task. The second domain is article recommendation, where each user query defines a new reward function and an article's relevance is the expected return from following a policy that follows the citations between articles. Our experiments show that UOMs are substantially more efficient than previously known methods for evaluating option returns and policies over options.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "Indian Institute of Science"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Hengshuai Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Hengshuai", "Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szepesv=aacute=ri:Csaba", "Richard S.
