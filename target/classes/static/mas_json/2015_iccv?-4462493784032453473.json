{"title": "kNN Hashing with Factorized Neighborhood Representation.", "fields": ["feature hashing", "dynamic perfect hashing", "k independent hashing", "hash table", "universal hashing"], "abstract": "Hashing is very effective for many tasks in reducing the processing time and in compressing massive databases. Although lots of approaches have been developed to learn data-dependent hash functions in recent years, how to learn hash functions to yield good performance with acceptable computational and memory cost is still a challenging problem. Based on the observation that retrieval precision is highly related to the kNN classification accuracy, this paper proposes a novel kNN-based supervised hashing method, which learns hash functions by directly maximizing the kNN accuracy of the Hamming-embedded training data. To make it scalable well to large problem, we propose a factorized neighborhood representation to parsimoniously model the neighborhood relationships inherent in training data. Considering that real-world data are often linearly inseparable, we further kernelize this basic model to improve its performance. As a result, the proposed method is able to learn accurate hashing functions with tolerable computation and storage cost. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Nat. Lab. of Pa ...
