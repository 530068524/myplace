Virtual environments offer new navigation and interaction methods, immersive installations, and haptic and olfactoric output. We introduce an extension to VR systems, which makes it possible to use a wide range of multimodal effects from gaming and VR to be activated and modified on a per object basis at runtime. To access, manipulate, and add effects to the objects of a scene intuitively, our extension realizes an abstract, hierarchical scene concept using multimodal objects. Multiple effects can be added to each object and the parameters of each effect can be manipulated online. Fading of effects and bundling of multiple effects for multiple objects are more advanced features of the system.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Hamburg", "University of Hamburg"], "authors": ["Matthias Haringer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haringer:Matthias", "Steffi Beckhaus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beckhaus:Steffi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
