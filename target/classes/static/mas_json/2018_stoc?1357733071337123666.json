For the last few years, substantial progress has been made on the  approximate  single source shortest paths problem, culminating in an algorithm of Henzinger, Krinninger, and Nanongkai\u00a0[STOC\u201916] which deterministically computes (1+ o (1))-approximate shortest paths in O( D +\u221a n ) time, where  D  is the hop-diameter of the graph. Up to logarithmic factors, this time complexity is optimal, matching the lower bound of Elkin\u00a0[STOC\u201904].    The question of  exact  shortest paths however saw no algorithmic progress for decades, until the recent breakthrough of Elkin [STOC\u201917], which established a sublinear-time algorithm for exact single source shortest paths on undirected graphs. Shortly after, Huang et al. [FOCS\u201917] provided improved algorithms for exact all pairs shortest paths problem on directed graphs.    In this paper, we provide an alternative single-source shortest path algorithm with complexity O( n  3/4  D  1/4 ). For polylogarithmic  D , this improves on Elkin\u2019s O( n  5/6 ) bound and gets closer to the \u03a9( n  1/2 ) lower bound of Elkin\u00a0[STOC\u201904]. For larger values of  D , we present an improved variant of our algorithm which achieves complexity O(max{  n  3/4+ o (1)  ,  n  3/4  D  1/6 } +  D  ), and thus compares favorably with Elkin\u2019s bound of O(max{  n  5/6 ,  n  2/3  D  1/3 } +  D  ) in essentially the entire range of parameters. This algorithm provides also a qualitative improvement, because it works for the more challenging case of directed graph (i.e., graphs where the two directions of an edge can have different weights), constituting the first sublinear-time algorithm for directed graphs. Our algorithm also extends to the case of exact  r -source shortest paths, in which we provide the fastest algorithm for moderately small  r  and  D , improving on those of Huang et al.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Mohsen Ghaffari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghaffari:Mohsen", "Jason Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jason"], "pages": 14}
