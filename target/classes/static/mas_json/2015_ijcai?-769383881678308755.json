{"title": "Trailer Generation via a Point Process-Based Visual Attractiveness Model.", "fields": ["attractiveness", "point process", "graph", "trailer", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "Producing attractive trailers for videos needs human expertise and creativity, and hence is challenging and costly. Different from video summarization that focuses on capturing storylines or important scenes, trailer generation aims at producing trailers that are attractive so that viewers will be eager to watch the original video. In this work, we study the problem of automatic trailer generation, in which an attractive trailer is produced given a video and a piece of music. We propose a surrogate measure of video attractiveness named fixation variance, and learn a novel self-correcting point process-based attractiveness model that can effectively describe the dynamics of attractiveness of a video. Furthermore, based on the attractiveness model learned from existing training trailers, we propose an efficient graph-based trailer generation algorithm to produce a max-attractiveness trailer. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art trailer generators in terms of both quality and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Hongteng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Hongteng", "Yi Zhen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhen:Yi", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
