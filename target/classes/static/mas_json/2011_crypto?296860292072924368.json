{"title": "How to Improve Rebound Attacks.", "fields": ["rebound attack", "computer science", "theoretical computer science", "hash function", "cryptanalysis"], "abstract": "Rebound attacks are a state-of-the-art analysis method for hash functions. These cryptanalysis methods are based on a well chosen differential path and have been applied to several hash functions from the SHA-3 competition, providing the best known analysis in these cases. In this paper we study rebound attacks in detail and find for a large number of cases that the complexities of existing attacks can be improved.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["FHNW, Windisch, Switzerland"], "authors": ["Mar\u00eda Naya-Plasencia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naya=Plasencia:Mar=iacute=a"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2011", "pages": 18}
