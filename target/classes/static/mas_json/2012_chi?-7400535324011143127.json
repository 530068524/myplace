In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of how the news broke and spread on Twitter. We confirm the claim that Twitter broke the news first, and find evidence that Twitter had convinced a large number of its audience before mainstream media confirmed the news. We also discover that attention on Twitter was highly concentrated on a small number of \"opinion leaders\" and identify three groups of opinion leaders who played key roles in spreading the news: individuals affiliated with media played a large part in breaking the news, mass media brought the news to a wider audience and provided eager Twitter users with content on external sites, and celebrities helped to spread the news and stimulate conversation. Our findings suggest Twitter has great potential as a news medium.", "citation": "Citations (136)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of California, Davis", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Mengdie Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Mengdie", "Shixia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shixia", "Furu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Furu", "Yingcai Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yingcai", "John T.
