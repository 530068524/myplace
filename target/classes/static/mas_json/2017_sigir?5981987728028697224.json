{"title": "Stacking Bagged and Boosted Forests for Effective Automated Classification.", "fields": ["stacking", "exploit", "boosting", "speedup", "random forest"], "abstract": "Random Forest (RF) is one of the most successful strategies for automated classification tasks. Motivated by the RF success, recently proposed RF-based classification approaches leverage the central RF idea of aggregating a large number of low-correlated trees, which are inherently parallelizable and provide exceptional generalization capabilities. In this context, this work brings several new contributions to this line of research. First, we propose a new RF-based strategy (BERT) that applies the boosting technique in bags of extremely randomized trees. Second, we empirically demonstrate that this new strategy, as well as the recently proposed BROOF and LazyNN_RF classifiers do complement each other, motivating us to stack them to produce an even more effective classifier. Up to our knowledge, this is the first strategy to effectively combine the three main ensemble strategies: stacking, bagging (the cornerstone of RFs) and boosting. Finally, we exploit the efficient and unbiased stacking strategy based on out-of-bag (OOB) samples to considerably speedup the very costly training process of the stacking procedure. Our experiments in several datasets covering two high-dimensional and noisy domains of topic and sentiment classification provide strong evidence in favor of the benefits of our RF-based solutions. We show that BERT is among the top performers in the vast majority of analyzed cases, while retaining the unique benefits of RF classifiers (explainability, parallelization, easiness of parameterization). We also show that stacking only the recently proposed RF-based classifiers and BERT using our OOB-based strategy is not only significantly faster than recently proposed stacking strategies (up to six times) but also much more effective, with gains up to 21% and 17% on MacroF1 and MicroF1, respectively, over the best base method, and of 5% and 6% over a stacking of traditional methods, performing no worse than a complete stacking of methods at a much lower computational effort.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"], "authors": ["Raphael R.
