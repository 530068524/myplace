Standardized in 2015 with a few new features, HTTP/2 is gradually replacing HTTP 1.1 to improve user experience. Yet, how HTTP/2 can help improve the video streaming delivery has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we set to investigate how to utilize the new features offered by HTTP/2 for video streaming over the Internet, focusing on the streaming delivery to mobile devices as, today, more and more users watch video on their mobile devices. For this purpose, we design DASH2M, Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP/2 to Mobile Devices. DASH2M deliberately schedules the streaming content delivery by comprehensively considering the user's Quality of Experience (QoE), the dynamics of the network resources, and the power efficiency on the mobile devices. Experiments based on an implemented prototype show that DASH2M can outperform prior strategies for users' QoE while minimizing the battery power consumption on mobile devices.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "George Mason University"], "authors": ["Mengbai Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Mengbai", "Viswanathan Swaminathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swaminathan:Viswanathan", "Sheng Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei_0001:Sheng", "Songqing Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Songqing"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
