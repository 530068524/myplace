{"title": "FADE: A programmable filtering accelerator for instruction-grain monitoring.", "fields": ["software analysis pattern", "microarchitecture", "system monitoring", "fade", "slowdown"], "abstract": "Instruction-grain monitoring is a powerful approach that enables a wide spectrum of bug-finding tools. As existing software approaches incur prohibitive runtime overhead, researchers have focused on hardware support for instruction-grain monitoring. A recurring theme in recent work is the use of hardware-assisted filtering so as to elide costly software analysis. This work generalizes and extends prior point solutions into a programmable filtering accelerator affording vast flexibility and at-speed event filtering. The pipelined microarchitecture of the accelerator affords a peak filtering rate of one application event per cycle, which suffices to keep up with an aggressive OoO core running the monitored application. A unique feature of the proposed design is the ability to dynamically resolve dependencies between unfilterable events and subsequent events, eliminating data-dependent stalls and maximizing accelerator's performance. Our evaluation results show a monitoring slowdown of just 1.2\u20131.8x across a diverse set of monitoring tools.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Oracle Corporation", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Sotiria Fytraki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fytraki:Sotiria", "Evangelos Vlachos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vlachos:Evangelos", "Yusuf Onur Ko\u00e7berber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ko=ccedil=berber:Yusuf_Onur", "Babak Falsafi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Falsafi:Babak", "Boris Grot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grot:Boris"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
