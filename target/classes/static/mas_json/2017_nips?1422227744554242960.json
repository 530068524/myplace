So far, most existing methods only work for classification and are not designed to alter the true performance measure of the problem at hand. We introduce a novel flexible approach named Houdini for generating adversarial examples specifically tailored for the final performance measure of the task considered, be it combinatorial and non-decomposable. We successfully apply Houdini to a range of applications such as speech recognition, pose estimation and semantic segmentation. In all cases, the attacks based on Houdini achieve higher success rate than those based on the traditional surrogates used to train the models while using a less perceptible adversarial perturbation.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Facebook", "Bar-Ilan University", "Facebook", "Bar-Ilan University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Moustapha Ciss\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciss=eacute=:Moustapha", "Yossi Adi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adi:Yossi", "Natalia Neverova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neverova:Natalia", "Joseph Keshet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keshet:Joseph"], "pages": 11}
