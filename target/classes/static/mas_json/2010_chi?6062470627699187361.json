Through a study of note-taking habits, we observed that different strategies are used to organize and share notes. Based on these observations, we developed a design for a notebook that combines different approaches to better support these activities. The details of our design were informed by an additional online survey. We emphasize the need to examine the characteristics of taking notes with paper notebooks in order to develop a digital system that resembles the quality of traditional writing. With NiCEBook, we present a solution that combines the flexibility and simplicity of taking notes on paper with the benefits of a digital representation. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system through customized views, searching and sharing functionality.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Upper Austria U ... enberg, Austria", "Upper Austria U ... enberg, Austria", "Upper Austria U ... enberg, Austria"], "authors": ["Peter Brandl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brandl:Peter", "Christoph Richter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Richter:Christoph", "Michael Haller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haller:Michael"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
