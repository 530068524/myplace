{"title": "Salient Object Detection via Low-Rank and Structured Sparse Matrix Decomposition.", "fields": ["prior probability", "image retrieval", "matrix decomposition", "salience", "sparse matrix"], "abstract": "Salient object detection provides an alternative solution to various image semantic understanding tasks such as object recognition, adaptive compression and image retrieval. Recently, low-rank matrix recovery (LR) theory has been introduced into saliency detection, and achieves impressed results. However, the existing LR-based models neglect the underlying structure of images, and inevitably degrade the associated performance. In this paper, we propose a Low-rank and Structured sparse Matrix Decomposition (LSMD) model for salient object detection. In the model, a tree-structured sparsity-inducing norm regularization is firstly introduced to provide a hierarchical description of the image structure to ensure the completeness of the extracted salient object. The similarity of saliency values within the salient object is then guaranteed by the l\u221e-norm. Finally, high-level priors are integrated to guide the matrix decomposition and enhance the saliency detection. Experimental results on the largest public benchmark database show that our model outperforms existing LR-based approaches and other state-of-the-art methods, which verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the structure cues in our model.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Xiamen University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Houwen Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Houwen", "Bing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Bing", "Rongrong Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Rongrong", "Weiming Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Weiming", "Weihua Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Weihua", "Congyan Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:Congyan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
