The Kneser graphs of the form  K (2 k +1, k ) are also known as the  odd graphs . We settle an old problem due to Meredith, Lloyd, and Biggs from the 1970s, proving that for every  k \u22653, the odd graph  K (2 k +1, k ) has a Hamilton cycle. This and a known conditional result due to Johnson imply that all Kneser graphs of the form  K (2 k +2  a  , k ) with  k \u22653 and  a \u22650 have a Hamilton cycle. We also prove that  K (2 k +1, k ) has at least 2 2  k \u22126   distinct Hamilton cycles for  k \u22656. Our proofs are based on a reduction of the Hamiltonicity problem in the odd graph to the problem of finding a spanning tree in a suitably defined hypergraph on Dyck words.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "ETH Zurich", "Jagiellonian University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Torsten M\u00fctze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=tze:Torsten", "Jerri Nummenpalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nummenpalo:Jerri", "Bartosz Walczak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walczak:Bartosz"], "pages": 8}
