We 1 Give definitions of mu ind indistinguishability and mu kr key recovery security for AE 2 Characterize the intent of nonce randomization as being improved mu security as a defense against mass surveillance 3 Cast the method as a new AE scheme RGCM 4 Analyze and compare the mu security of both GCM and RGCM in the model where the underlying block cipher is ideal, showing that the mu security of the latter is indeed superior in many practical contexts to that of the former, and 5 Propose an alternative AE scheme XGCM having the same efficiency as RGCM but better mu security and a more simple and modular design.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Bj\u00f6rn Tackmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tackmann:Bj=ouml=rn"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2016", "pages": 30}
