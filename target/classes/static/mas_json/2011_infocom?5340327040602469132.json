{"title": "Optimal Sybil-resilient node admission control.", "fields": ["network security", "binary logarithm", "adversary", "admission control", "authorization"], "abstract": "Most existing large-scale networked systems on the Internet such as peer-to-peer systems are vulnerable to Sybil attacks where a single adversary can introduce many bogus identities. One promising defense of Sybil attacks is to perform social-network based admission control to bound the number of Sybil identities admitted. SybilLimit [22], the best known Sybil admission control mechanism, can restrict the number of Sybil identities admitted per attack edge to O(log n) with high probability assuming O(n/ log n) attack edges. In this paper, we propose Gatekeeper, a decentralized Sybil-resilient admission control protocol that significantly improves over SybilLimit. Gatekeeper is optimal for the case of O(1) attack edges and admits only O(1) Sybil identities (with high probability) in a random expander social networks (real-world social networks exhibit expander properties). In the face of O(k) attack edges (for any k \u2208 O(n/ log n)), Gatekeeper admits O(log k) Sybils per attack edge. This result provides a graceful continuum across the spectrum of attack edges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gatekeeper experimentally on real-world social networks and synthetic topologies.", "citation": "Citations (176)", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "authors": ["Dinh Nguyen Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran:Dinh_Nguyen", "Jinyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Jinyang", "Lakshminarayanan Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Lakshminarayanan", "Sherman S.
