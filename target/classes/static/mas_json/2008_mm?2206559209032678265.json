{"title": "Content based automatic zooming: viewing documents on small displays.", "fields": ["electronic document", "metadata", "zoom", "viewport", "bitmap"], "abstract": "We present an automatic zooming technique that leverages content analysis for viewing a document page on a small display such as a mobile phone or PDA. The page can come from a scanned document (bitmap image) or an electronic document (text and graphics data plus metadata). The page with text and graphics is segmented into regions. For each region, a scale-distortion function is constructed based on image analysis of the signal distortion that occurs at different scales. During interactive viewing of the document, as the user navigates by moving the viewport around the page, the zoom factor is automatically adjusted by optimizing the scale-distortion functions of the regions visible in the viewport.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "Fuji Xerox", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory"], "authors": ["Patrick Chiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiu:Patrick", "Koichi Fujii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujii:Koichi", "Qiong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qiong"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
