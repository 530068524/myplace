{"title": "Bma: Visual Tool for Modeling and Analyzing Biological Networks.", "fields": ["formal methods", "theoretical computer science", "biological network", "mathematical proof", "graphical user interface"], "abstract": "BioModel Analyzer (bma) is a tool for modeling and analyzing biological networks. Designed with a lightweight graphical user interface, the tool facilitates usage for biologists with no previous knowledge in programming or formal methods. The current implementation analyzes systems to establish stabilization. The results of the analysis--whether they be proofs or counterexamples--are represented visually. This paper describes the approach to modeling used in bma and also notes soon-to-be-released extensions to the tool.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["David Benque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benque:David", "Sam Bourton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bourton:Sam", "Caitlin Cockerton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cockerton:Caitlin", "Byron Cook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cook:Byron", "Jasmin Fisher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fisher:Jasmin", "Samin Ishtiaq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishtiaq:Samin", "Nir Piterman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piterman:Nir", "Alex S.
