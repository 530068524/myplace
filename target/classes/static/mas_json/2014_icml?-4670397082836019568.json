Given a finite sample, an empirical average is the standard estimate for the true kernel mean. We show that this estimator can be improved due to a well-known phenomenon in statistics called Stein's phenomenon. After consideration, our theoretical analysis reveals the existence of a wide class of estimators that are better than the standard one. Focusing on a subset of this class, we propose efficient shrinkage estimators for the kernel mean. Empirical evaluations on several applications clearly demonstrate that the proposed estimators outperform the standard kernel mean estimator.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "University of Cambridge", "University College London", "Max Planck Society", "The Institute o ... s, Tokyo, Japan"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Krikamol Muandet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muandet:Krikamol", "Kenji Fukumizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukumizu:Kenji", "Bharath K.
