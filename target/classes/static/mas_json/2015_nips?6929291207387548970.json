{"title": "Statistical Topological Data Analysis - A Kernel Perspective.", "fields": ["polynomial kernel", "positive definite kernel", "string kernel", "tree kernel", "kernel embedding of distributions"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a summary representation of topological features in data. These diagrams encode persistent homology, a widely used invariant in topological data analysis. While several avenues towards a statistical treatment of the diagrams have been explored recently, we follow an alternative route that is motivated by the success of methods based on the embedding of probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In fact, a positive definite kernel on persistence diagrams has recently been proposed, connecting persistent homology to popular kernel-based learning techniques such as support vector machines. However, important properties of that kernel enabling a principled use in the context of probability measure embeddings remain to be explored. Our contribution is to close this gap by proving universality of a variant of the original kernel, and to demonstrate its effective use in two-sample hypothesis testing on synthetic as well as real-world data.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Salzburg", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Roland Kwitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwitt:Roland", "Stefan Huber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huber_0001:Stefan", "Marc Niethammer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niethammer:Marc", "Weili Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Weili", "Ulrich Bauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauer:Ulrich"], "pages": 9}
