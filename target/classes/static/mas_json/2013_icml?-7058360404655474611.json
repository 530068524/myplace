Such criteria are useful for risk management, and are important in domains such as finance and process control. We propose variants of both TD(0) and LSTD(\u03bb) with linear function approximation, prove their convergence, and demonstrate their utility in a 4-dimensional continuous state space problem.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Aviv Tamar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamar:Aviv", "Dotan Di Castro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castro:Dotan_Di", "Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
