{"title": "An Unsupervised Model for Joint Phrase Alignment and Extraction.", "fields": ["bayesian probability", "phrase", "sentence", "machine translation", "rule based machine translation"], "abstract": "We present an unsupervised model for joint phrase alignment and extraction using non-parametric Bayesian methods and inversion transduction grammars (ITGs). The key contribution is that phrases of many granularities are included directly in the model through the use of a novel formulation that memorizes phrases generated not only by terminal, but also non-terminal symbols. This allows for a completely probabilistic model that is able to create a phrase table that achieves competitive accuracy on phrase-based machine translation tasks directly from unaligned sentence pairs. Experiments on several language pairs demonstrate that the proposed model matches the accuracy of traditional two-step word alignment/phrase extraction approach while reducing the phrase table to a fraction of the original size.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "Kyoto University", "Kyoto University", "National Instit ... , Kyoto, Japan", "National Instit ... , Kyoto, Japan"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Graham Neubig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neubig:Graham", "Taro Watanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watanabe:Taro", "Eiichiro Sumita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sumita:Eiichiro", "Shinsuke Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Shinsuke", "Tatsuya Kawahara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawahara:Tatsuya"], "pages": 10}
