{"title": "Interactive User Feedback in Ontology Matching Using Signature Vectors.", "fields": ["semantic integration", "ontology", "process ontology", "ontology alignment", "ontology based data integration"], "abstract": "When compared to a gold standard, the set of mappings that are generated by an automatic ontology matching process is neither complete nor are the individual mappings always correct. However, given the explosion in the number, size, and complexity of available ontologies, domain experts no longer have the capability to create ontology mappings without considerable effort. We present a solution to this problem that consists of making the ontology matching process interactive so as to incorporate user feedback in the loop. Our approach clusters mappings to identify where user feedback will be most beneficial in reducing the number of user interactions and system iterations. This feedback process has been implemented in the Agreement Maker system and is supported by visual analytic techniques that help users to better understand the matching process. Experimental results using the OAEI benchmarks show the effectiveness of our approach. We will demonstrate how users can interact with the ontology matching process through the Agreement Maker user interface to match real-world ontologies.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Milan"], "authors": ["Isabel F.
