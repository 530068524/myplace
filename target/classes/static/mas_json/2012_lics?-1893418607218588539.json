Can \"perfect\" randomness be produced with this coin? The answer is positive, thanks to a little trick discovered by von Neumann. In this paper, we investigate a generalization of this question: if we have access to a source of bits produced according to some probability measure in some class of measures, and suppose we know the class but not the measure (in the above example, the class would be the class of all Bernoulli measures), can perfect randomness be produced? We will look at this question from the viewpoint of effective mathematics and in particular the theory of effective randomness.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["LIAFA, Univ. de ... , Paris, France", "LIAFA, Univ. de ... , Paris, France"], "authors": ["Laurent Bienvenu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bienvenu:Laurent", "Benoit Monin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monin:Benoit"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
