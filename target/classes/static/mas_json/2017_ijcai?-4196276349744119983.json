{"title": "A Structural Representation Learning for Multi-relational Networks.", "fields": ["stochastic gradient descent", "parallelogram", "feature learning", "competitive learning", "wordnet"], "abstract": "Most of the existing multi-relational network embedding methods, e.g., TransE, are formulated to preserve pair-wise connectivity structures in the networks. With the observations that significant triangular connectivity structures and parallelogram connectivity structures found in many real multi-relational networks are often ignored and that a hard-constraint commonly adopted by most of the network embedding methods is inaccurate by design, we propose a novel representation learning model for multi-relational networks which can alleviate both fundamental limitations. Scalable learning algorithms are derived using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm and negative sampling. Extensive experiments on real multi-relational network datasets of WordNet and Freebase demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model when compared with the state-of-the-art embedding methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "Hong Kong Baptist University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Lin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Lin", "Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0033:Xin", "William K.
