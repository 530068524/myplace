So far the SNC is based on (tacitly assumed) exact probabilistic assumptions about the arrival processes. Yet, in practice, these are only true approximately-at best. In many situations it is hard, if possible at all, to make such assumptions a priori. A more practical approach would be to base the SNC operations on measurements of the arrival processes (preferably even on-line). In this paper, we develop this idea and incorporate measurements into the framework of SNC taking the further uncertainty resulting from estimation errors into account. This is a crucial step towards a statistical network calculus (StatNC) eventually lending itself to a self-modelling operation of networks with a minimum of a priori assumptions. In numerical exper- iments, we are able to substantiate the novel opportunities by StatNC.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology"], "authors": ["Michael A.
