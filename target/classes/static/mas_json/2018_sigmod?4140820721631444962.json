{"title": "A Demonstration of Sya: A Spatial Probabilistic Knowledge Base Construction System.", "fields": ["statistical inference", "graphical model", "probabilistic logic", "knowledge base", "sql"], "abstract": "This demo presents Sya; the first full-fledged spatial probabilistic knowledge base construction system. Sya is a comprehensive extension to the DeepDive system that enables exploiting the spatial relationships between extracted relations during the knowledge base construction process, and hence results in a better knowledge base output. Sya runs existing DeepDive programs as is, yet, it extracts more accurate relations than DeepDive when dealing with input data that have spatial attributes. Sya employs a simple spatial high-level language, a rule-based spatial SQL query engine, a spatially-indexed probabilistic graphical model, and an adapted spatial statistical inference technique to infer the factual scores of relations. We demonstrate a real system prototype of Sya, showing a case study of constructing a crime knowledge base. The demonstration shows to the audience the internal steps of building the knowledge base, as well as a comparison with the output of DeepDive.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ibrahim Sabek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabek:Ibrahim", "Mashaal Musleh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Musleh:Mashaal", "Mohamed F.
