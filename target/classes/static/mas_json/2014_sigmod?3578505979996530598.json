Storm is a real-time fault-tolerant and distributed stream data processing system. Storm is currently being used to run various critical computations in Twitter at scale, and in real-time. This paper describes the architecture of Storm and its methods for distributed scale-out and fault-tolerance. This paper also describes how queries (aka. topologies) are executed in Storm, and presents some operational stories based on running Storm at Twitter. We also present results from an empirical evaluation demonstrating the resilience of Storm in dealing with machine failures. Storm is under active development at Twitter and we also present some potential directions for future work.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Twitter", "Twitter", "Twitter", "Twitter", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "William Carey University", "William Carey University", "William Carey University", "William Carey University", "William Carey University", "Pennsylvania State University", "University of Connecticut", "University of Central Florida", "University of Connecticut", "University of Calgary", "McGill University", "McGill University", "Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ankit Toshniwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toshniwal:Ankit", "Siddarth Taneja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taneja:Siddarth", "Amit Shukla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shukla:Amit", "Karthikeyan Ramasamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramasamy:Karthikeyan", "Jignesh M.
