{"title": "Latent Predictor Networks for Code Generation.", "fields": ["data set", "code generation", "source code", "scalability", "granularity"], "abstract": "Many language generation tasks require the production of text conditioned on both structured and unstructured inputs. We present a novel neural network architecture which generates an output sequence conditioned on an arbitrary number of input functions. Crucially, our approach allows both the choice of conditioning context and the granularity of generation, for example characters or tokens, to be marginalised, thus permitting scalable and effective training. Using this framework, we address the problem of generating programming code from a mixed natural language and structured specification. We create two new data sets for this paradigm derived from the collectible trading card games Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. On these, and a third preexisting corpus, we demonstrate that marginalising multiple predictors allows our model to outperform strong benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Oxford", "Google", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Wang Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Wang", "Phil Blunsom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blunsom:Phil", "Edward Grefenstette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grefenstette:Edward", "Karl Moritz Hermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hermann:Karl_Moritz", "Tom\u00e1s Kocisk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kocisk=yacute=:Tom=aacute=s", "Fumin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Fumin", "Andrew W.
