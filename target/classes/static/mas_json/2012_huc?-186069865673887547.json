Ten volunteering households were instrumented with video cameras with microphones, and computer, wireless network, smartphone, TV, DVD, and customer card use was logged. We report on stress, anxiety, concerns, and privacy-seeking behavior after six months. The data provide first insight into the privacy-invading character of ubiquitous surveillance in the home and explain how people can gradually become accustomed to surveillance even if they oppose it.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki"], "authors": ["Antti Oulasvirta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oulasvirta:Antti", "Aurora Pihlajamaa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pihlajamaa:Aurora", "Jukka Perki\u00f6.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perki=ouml=:Jukka", "Debarshi Ray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ray:Debarshi", "Taneli V\u00e4h\u00e4kangas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/V=auml=h=auml=kangas:Taneli", "Tero Hasu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasu:Tero", "Niklas Vainio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vainio:Niklas", "Petri Myllym\u00e4ki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Myllym=auml=ki:Petri"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
