{"title": "Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Clustering on Multiple Manifolds.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "subspace topology", "non negative matrix factorization", "manifold", "matrix"], "abstract": "Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a widely used technique in many applications such as clustering. It approximates the nonnegative data in an original high dimensional space with a linear representation in a low dimensional space by using the product of two nonnegative matrices. In many applications with data such as human faces or digits, data often reside on multiple manifolds, which may overlap or intersect. But the traditional NMF method and other existing variants of NMF do not consider this. This paper proposes a novel clustering algorithm that explicitly models the intrinsic geometrical structure of the data on multiple manifolds with NMF. The idea of the proposed algorithm is that a data point generated by several neighboring points on a specific manifold in the original space should be constructed in a similar way in the low dimensional subspace. A set of experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Bin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen_0002:Bin", "Luo Si.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Si:Luo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
