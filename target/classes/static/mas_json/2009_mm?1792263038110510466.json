Instead of using low level visual features, we present a novel computational visual attention model to assess photos. Firstly, a face-sensitive saliency map analysis is deployed to estimate attention distribution. Then, a Rate of Focused Attention (RFA) measurement is proposed to quantify photo quality. By integrating top-down supervision into the visual attention model, we further achieve personalized photo assessment to take user preference into quality evaluation, which can be extended into object or semantic oriented photo assessment scenarios. Experiments on personal photo albums with comparison to ground-truth user evaluations demonstrate the effeteness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Xiaoshuai Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Xiaoshuai", "Hongxun Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Hongxun", "Rongrong Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Rongrong", "Shaohui Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shaohui"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
