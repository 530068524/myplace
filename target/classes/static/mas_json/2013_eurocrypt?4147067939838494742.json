We stress that we avoid converting the RAM programs into circuits. As an example, our techniques implies the first garbled binary search program (searching over sorted encrypted data stored in a cloud) which is poly-logarithmic in the data size instead of linear. Our result requires the existence of one-way function and enjoys the same non-interactive properties as Yao's original garbled circuits.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Stealth Softwar ... hnologies, Inc."], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Steve Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Steve", "Rafail Ostrovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostrovsky:Rafail"], "pages": 16}
