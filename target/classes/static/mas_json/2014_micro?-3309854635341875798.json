This requires extensive analysis, including significant fault modelling allow architects to make informed reliability tradeoffs. Recent data shows that multi-bit transient faults are becoming more common, increasing from 0.5% of static random-access memory (SRAM) faults in 180nm to 3.9% in 22nm. Such faults are predicted to be even more prevalent in smaller technology nodes. Therefore, accurately modeling the effects of multi-bit transient faults is increasingly important to the microprocessor design process.   Architecture vulnerability factor (AVF) analysis is a method to model the effects of single-bit transient faults. In this paper, we propose a method to calculate AVFs for spatial multibittransient faults (MB-AVFs) and provide insights that can help reduce the impact of these faults. First, we describe a novel multi-bit AVF analysis approach for detected uncorrected errors (DUEs) and show how to measure DUE MB-AVFs in a performance simulator. We then extend our approach to measure silent data corruption (SDC) MB-AVFs. We find that MB-AVFs are not derivable from single-bit AVFs. We also find that larger fault modes have higher MB-AVFs. Finally, we present a case study on using MB-AVF analysis to optimize processor design, yielding SDC reductions of 86% in a GPU vector register file.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Northeastern University", "Advanced Micro Devices"], "authors": ["Mark Wilkening.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilkening:Mark", "Vilas Sridharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sridharan:Vilas", "Si Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Si", "Fritz Previlon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Previlon:Fritz", "Sudhanva Gurumurthi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurumurthi:Sudhanva", "David R.
