We formalize the notion of a geometry proof problem and describe an algorithm for generating such problems over a user-provided figure. Our experimental results indicate that our problem generation algorithm can effectively generate proof problems in elementary geometry. On a corpus of 110 figures taken from popular geometry textbooks, our system generated an average of about 443 problems per figure in an average time of 4.7 seconds per figure.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Louisiana State University", "Microsoft", "Louisiana State University", "MPI, SWS"], "authors": ["Chris Alvin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alvin:Chris", "Sumit Gulwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gulwani:Sumit", "Rupak Majumdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majumdar:Rupak", "Supratik Mukhopadhyay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukhopadhyay:Supratik"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 8}
