{"title": "GPUnet: Networking Abstractions for GPU Programs.", "fields": ["abstraction", "distributed computing", "parallel computing", "popularity", "server", "active networking"], "abstract": "Despite the popularity of GPUs in high-performance and scientific computing, and despite increasingly general-purpose hardware capabilities, the use of GPUs in network servers or distributed systems poses significant challenges.   GPUnet is a native GPU networking layer that provides a socket abstraction and high-level networking APIs for GPU programs. We use GPUnet to streamline the development of high-performance, distributed applications like in-GPU-memory MapReduce and a new class of low-latency, high-throughput GPU-native network services such as a face verification server.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Sangman Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sangman", "Seonggu Huh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huh:Seonggu", "Xinya Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xinya", "Yige Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yige", "Amir Wated.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wated:Amir", "Emmett Witchel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Witchel:Emmett", "Mark Silberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silberstein:Mark"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2014", "pages": 16}
