Apart from the printed antenna, there are no external components. The IC is implemented in a 0.5-/spl mu/m digital two-poly two-metal digital CMOS technology with EEPROM and Schottky diodes. The IC's power supply is taken from the energy of the received RF electromagnetic field with help of a Schottky diode voltage multiplier. The IC includes dc power supply generation, phase shift keying backscatter modulator, pulse width modulation demodulator, EEPROM, and logic circuitry including some finite state machines handling the protocol used for wireless write and read access to the IC's EEPROM and for the anticollision procedure. The IC outperforms other reported radio-frequency identification ICs by a factor of three in terms of required receive power level for a given base-station transmit power and tag antenna gain.", "citation": "Citations (1,075)", "departments": ["CERN", "CERN", "CERN", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "Tel Aviv University", "Westinghouse Electric", "Westinghouse Electric", "Westinghouse Electric", "Westinghouse Electric", "Westinghouse Electric", "RF Commun.
