At the same time, as the computer diffuses into the physical world, it loses its location-neutrality, exposing the urgent need for a debate of design choices in ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we discuss the process of urban development as a source of inspiration for such design choices. Looking from the ground up, of particular interest is the opportunity to  localize  and  democratize  an emerging ubiquitous computing infrastructure. The design choices we negotiate today will determine the society in which we will live in the future.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["Sebastian Weise.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weise:Sebastian", "John Hardy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardy:John", "Pragya Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Pragya", "Paul Coulton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coulton:Paul", "Adrian Friday.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friday:Adrian", "Mike Chiasson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiasson:Mike"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
