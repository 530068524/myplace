{"title": "Communication-Driven Localization and Mapping for Millimeter Wave Networks.", "fields": ["meter", "software deployment", "gigabit", "simultaneous localization and mapping", "extremely high frequency"], "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are an essential component of 5G-and-beyond ultra-dense Gbit/s wireless networks, but also pose significant challenges related to the communication environment. Especially beam-training and tracking, device association, and fast handovers for highly directional mmWave links may potentially incur a high overhead. At the same time, such mechanisms would benefit greatly from accurate knowledge about the environment and device locations that can be provided through simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms.\n\nIn this paper we tackle the above issues by proposing CLAM, a\ndistributed mmWave SLAM algorithm that works with no initial\ninformation  about  the  network  deployment  or  the  environment,\nand  achieves  low  computational  complexity  thanks  to  a  fundamental reformulation of the angle-differences-of-arrival mmWave anchor location estimation problem. All information required by CLAM is collected by a mmWave device thanks to beam training\nand  tracking  mechanisms  inherent  to  mmWave  networks,  at  no\nadditional overhead. Our results show that CLAM achieves sub-\nmeter accuracy in the great majority of cases. These results are\nvalidated  via  an  extensive  experimental  measurement  campaign\ncarried  out  with  60-GHz  mmWave  hardware.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["IMDEA", "Charles III University of Madrid", "IMDEA", "IMDEA"], "authors": ["Joan Palacios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palacios:Joan", "Guillermo Bielsa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bielsa:Guillermo", "Paolo Casari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casari:Paolo", "Joerg Widmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Widmer:Joerg"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
