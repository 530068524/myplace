In the present contribution we show that model checking bounded, non-uniform artifact-centric systems is undecidable. We provide a partial model checking procedure for artifact-centric systems against the universal fragment of a first-order version of the logic CTL. We obtain this result by introducing a counterpart semantics and developing an abstraction methodology operating on these structures. This enables us to generate finite abstractions of infinite artifact-centric systems, hence perform verification on abstract models.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Laboratoires IB ... versit\u00e9 d'Evry"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Francesco Belardinelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belardinelli:Francesco", "Alessio Lomuscio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lomuscio:Alessio"], "pages": 7}
