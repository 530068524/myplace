In this paper, we propose a novel causal inference algorithm called least-squares independence regression (LSIR). LSIR learns the additive noise model through minimization of an estimator of the squared-loss mutual information between inputs and residuals. A notable advantage of LSIR over existing approaches is that tuning parameters such as the kernel width and the regularization parameter can be naturally optimized by cross-validation, allowing us to avoid overfitting in a data-dependent fashion. Through experiments with real-world datasets, we show that LSIR compares favorably with the state-of-the-art causal inference method.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Makoto Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada:Makoto", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
