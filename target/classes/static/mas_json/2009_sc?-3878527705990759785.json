{"title": "Scalable implicit finite element solver for massively parallel processing with demonstration to 160K cores.", "fields": ["memory bandwidth", "polygon mesh", "ranging", "massively parallel", "solver"], "abstract": "Implicit methods for partial differential equations using unstructured meshes allow for an efficient solution strategy for many real-world problems (e.g., simulation-based virtual surgical planning). Scalable solvers employing these methods not only enable solution of extremely-large practical problems but also lead to dramatic compression in time-to-solution. We present a parallelization paradigm and associated procedures that enable our implicit, unstructured flow-solver to achieve strong scalability.   We consider fluid-flow examples in two application areas to show the effectiveness of our procedures that yield near-perfect strong-scaling on various (including near-petascale) systems. The first area includes a double-throat nozzle (DTN) whereas the second considers a patient-specific abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) model. We present excellent strong-scaling on three cases ranging from relatively small to large; a DTN model with O(10 6 ) elements up to 8,192 cores (9 core-doublings), an AAA model with O(10 8 ) elements up to 32,768 cores (6 core-doublings) and O(10 9 ) elements up to 163,840 cores.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Onkar Sahni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahni:Onkar", "Min Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Min", "Mark S.
