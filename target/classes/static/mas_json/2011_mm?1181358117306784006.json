However, due to the computational cost of state-of-the-art FRUC methods, real time applications of 2D-plus-depth is still limited. In this paper, we present a method of speeding up the FRUC of the depth video by treating it as part of a video coding process, combined with a novel color-mapping algorithm is adopted to improve the quality of temporal upsampling. Experiments show that the proposed systems saves up to 99.5% of the frame interpolation time, while achieving virtually identical reconstructed depth video as state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Yanjie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yanjie", "Lifeng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Lifeng", "Tianfan Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Tianfan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
