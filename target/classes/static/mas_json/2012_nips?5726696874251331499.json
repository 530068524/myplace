{"title": "A Marginalized Particle Gaussian Process Regression.", "fields": ["data set", "hyperparameter", "gaussian", "state space representation", "kriging"], "abstract": "We present a novel marginalized particle Gaussian process (MPGP) regression, which provides a fast, accurate online Bayesian filtering framework to model the latent function. Using a state space model established by the data construction procedure, our MPGP recursively filters out the estimation of hidden function values by a Gaussian mixture. Meanwhile, it provides a new online method for training hyperparameters with a number of weighted particles. We demonstrate the estimated performance of our MPGP on both simulated and real large data sets. The results show that our MPGP is a robust estimation algorithm with high computational efficiency, which outperforms other state-of-art sparse GP methods.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Laval University", "Laval University"], "authors": ["Yali Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yali", "Brahim Chaib-draa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaib=draa:Brahim"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
