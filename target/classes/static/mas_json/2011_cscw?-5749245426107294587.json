We develop the distinctions among newcomers to create different profiles of newcomers which are often clubbed together in a homogeneous group. These profiles are generalizations of activities, behavior and attitudes of newcomers in these communities and they highlight the differences among members of this group.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Vandana Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Vandana", "Aditya Johri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johri:Aditya", "Raktim Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Raktim"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
