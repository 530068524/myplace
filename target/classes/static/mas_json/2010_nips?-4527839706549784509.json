The reason is that the margin itself can not well describe how good a kernel is due to the negligence of the scaling. We use the ratio between the margin and the radius of the minimum enclosing ball to measure the goodness of a kernel, and present a new minimization formulation for kernel learning. This formulation is invariant to scalings of learned kernels, and when learning linear combination of basis kernels it is also invariant to scalings of basis kernels and to the types (e.g., L1 or L2) of norm constraints on combination coefficients. We establish the differentiability of our formulation, and propose a gradient projection algorithm for kernel learning. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both SVM with the uniform combination of basis kernels and other state-of-art MKL approaches.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Kun Gai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gai:Kun", "Guangyun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Guangyun", "Changshui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Changshui"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
