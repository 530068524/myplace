This work examines opportunities for lightweight photo-based capture in mobile food journals. We first report on a survey of 257 people, examining how they define healthy eating, their experiences and challenges with existing food journaling methods, and their ability to interpret nutritional information that can be captured in a food journal. We then report on interviews and a field study with 27 participants using a lightweight, photo-based food journal for between 4 to 8 weeks. We discuss mismatches between motivations and current designs, challenges of current approaches to food journaling, and opportunities for photos as an alternative to the pervasive but often inappropriate emphasis on quantitative tracking in mobile food journals.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Rochester", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Felicia Cordeiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cordeiro:Felicia", "Elizabeth Bales.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bales:Elizabeth", "Erin Cherry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cherry:Erin", "James Fogarty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fogarty:James"], "pages": 10}
