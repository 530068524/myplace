In a smartphone, display is one of the most energy consuming components. Modern smartphones often use OLED screens, which consume much more energy when displaying light colors than displaying dark colors. In our previous study, we proposed a technique to reduce display energy of mo- bile web apps by changing the color scheme automatically. With this approach, we achieved a 40% reduction in display power consumption and 97% user acceptance of the new color scheme. In this tool paper, we describe Nyx, which implements our approach. Nyx is implemented as a self- contained executable file with which users can optimize en- ergy consumption of their web apps with a simple command.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Ding Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ding", "Angelica Huyen Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran:Angelica_Huyen", "William G.
