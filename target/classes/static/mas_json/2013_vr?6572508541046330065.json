Our work explores the possibilities of using 3D projection on physical objects - a multi-projector set-up, which we aim to use for exhibition, teaching, design and early prototyping purposes. We also aim to create more immersive and engaging multimedia presentations, and change from conventional 2D media to 3D media by projecting the visual content on a physical object. This video demonstration presents two examples of tangible 3D projections. In our first demonstration we used a sphere shaped object and projected a visualization of rotating Earth on it with five projectors. We have recently done a study [1] that focused on audience's perceptions of 3D projection. Results were encouraging, and we will continue our work with the subject. In another demonstration we used a human shaped model and projected various datasets on it, including muscles, bones and digestive system. This setup contains two projectors, one in the back and the other one in the front of the body. 3D world contains 3D model of the human body and two camera views. In the future we will focus on enabling functional interactions to make projections more useful and interesting e.g. for teaching purposes. Interactions and automatic projector calibrations are the next steps to be implemented and examined in our project.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Oulu University of Applied Sciences", "Oulu University of Applied Sciences", "Oulu University of Applied Sciences"], "authors": ["Pekka Nisula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nisula:Pekka", "Jussi Kangasoja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kangasoja:Jussi", "Minna Karukka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karukka:Minna"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
