This paper connects fundamentals of vibration mechanics with computer vision techniques in order to infer material properties from small, often imperceptible motion in video. Objects tend to vibrate in a set of preferred modes. The shapes and frequencies of these modes depend on the structure and material properties of an object. Focusing on the case where geometry is known or fixed, we show how information about an object's modes of vibration can be extracted from video and used to make inferences about that object's material properties. We demonstrate our approach by estimating material properties for a variety of rods and fabrics by passively observing their motion in high-speed and regular framerate video.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Google", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Abe Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Abe", "Katherine L.
