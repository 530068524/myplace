{"title": "NESTT: A Nonconvex Primal-Dual Splitting Method for Distributed and Stochastic Optimization.", "fields": ["stochastic optimization", "quadratic equation", "augmented lagrangian method", "gradient descent", "distributed algorithm"], "abstract": "We study a stochastic and distributed algorithm for nonconvex problems whose objective consists a sum $N$ nonconvex $L_i/N$-smooth functions, plus a nonsmooth regularizer. The proposed NonconvEx primal-dual SpliTTing (NESTT) algorithm splits the problem into $N$ subproblems, and utilizes an augmented Lagrangian based primal-dual scheme to solve it in a distributed and stochastic manner. With a special non-uniform sampling, a version of NESTT achieves $\\epsilon$-stationary solution using $\\mathcal{O}((\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sqrt{L_i/N})^2/\\epsilon)$ gradient evaluations, which can be up to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ times better than the (proximal) gradient descent methods. It also achieves Q-linear convergence rate for nonconvex $\\ell_1$ penalized quadratic problems with polyhedral constraints. Further, we reveal a fundamental connection between {\\it primal-dual} based methods and a few {\\it primal only} methods such as IAG/SAG/SAGA.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Davood Hajinezhad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hajinezhad:Davood", "Mingyi Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Mingyi", "Tuo Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Tuo", "Zhaoran Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhaoran"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
