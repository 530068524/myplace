{"title": "On hardness of learning intersection of two halfspaces.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "integer", "time complexity", "e", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "We show that unless NP = RP, it is hard to (even) weakly PAC-learn intersection of two halfspaces in R n  using a hypothesis which is a function of up to l linear threshold functions for any integer l. Specifically, we show that for every integer l and an arbitrarily small constant e > 0, unless NP = RP, no polynomial time algorithm can distinguish whether there is an intersection of two halfspaces that correctly classifies a given set of labeled points in R n , or whether any function of l linear threshold functions can correctly classify at most 1/2+e fraction of the points.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "NYU, New York, NY, USA"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Subhash Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Subhash", "Rishi Saket.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saket:Rishi"], "pages": 10}
