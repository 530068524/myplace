{"title": "Representing Verbs as Argument Concepts.", "fields": ["hobby", "verb", "noun", "reflexive verb", "parameterized complexity"], "abstract": "Verbs play an important role in the understanding of natural language text. This paper studies the problem of abstracting the subject and object arguments of a verb into a set of noun concepts, known as the \"argument concepts\". This set of concepts, whose size is parameterized, represents the finegrained semantics of a verb. For example, the object of \"enjoy\" can be abstracted into time, hobby and event, etc. We present a novel framework to automatically infer human readable and machine computable action concepts with high accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Yu Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Yu", "Kaiqi Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Kaiqi", "Kenny Qili Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Kenny_Qili"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
