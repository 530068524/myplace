{"title": "A Unified Framework for Representation and Development of Dialectical Proof Procedures in Argumentation.", "fields": ["soundness", "commonsense reasoning", "dialectic", "discrete mathematics", "argumentation theory"], "abstract": "We present an unified methodology for representation and development of dialectical proof procedures in abstract argumentation based on the notions of legal environments and dispute derivations. A legal environment specifies the legal moves of the dispute parties while a dispute derivation describes the procedure structure. A key insight of this paper is that the opponent moves determine the soundness of a dispute while the completeness of a dispute procedure depends on the proponent moves.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Asian Institute of Technology", "Asian Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Phan Minh Dung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dung:Phan_Minh", "Phan Minh Thang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thang:Phan_Minh"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
