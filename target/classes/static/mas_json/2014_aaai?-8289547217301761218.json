In contrast to existing methods, we propose a novel approach that treats machine translation as a web search task and utilizes the web on the fly to acquire translation knowledge. This end-to-end approach takes advantage of fresh web search results that are capable of leveraging tremendous web knowledge to obtain phrase-level candidates on demand and then compose sentence-level translations. Experimental results show that our web-based machine translation method demonstrates very promising performance in leveraging fresh translation knowledge and making translation decisions. Furthermore, when combined with offline models, it significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Lei Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Lei", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming", "Qiming Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qiming", "Dongdong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dongdong", "Mu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mu"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
