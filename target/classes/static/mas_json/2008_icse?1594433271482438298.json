Given a small set of concrete structures, Deryaft analyzes their key characteristics to formulate local and global properties that the structures exhibit. For effective formulation of structural invariants, Deryaft focuses on graph properties, including reachability, and views the program heap as an edge-labeled graph. Deryaft outputs a Java predicate that represents the invariants; the predicate takes an input structure and returns true if and only if it satisfies the invariants.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Muhammad Zubair Malik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malik:Muhammad_Zubair", "Aman Pervaiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pervaiz:Aman", "Engin Uzuncaova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uzuncaova:Engin", "Sarfraz Khurshid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khurshid:Sarfraz"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
