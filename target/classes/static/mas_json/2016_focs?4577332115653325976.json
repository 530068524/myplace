{"title": "Constrained Submodular Maximization: Beyond 1/e.", "fields": ["maximization", "submodular set function", "polytope", "maximum coverage problem", "multilinear map"], "abstract": "In this work, we present a new algorithm for maximizing a non-monotone submodular function subject to a general constraint. Our algorithm finds an approximate fractional solution for maximizing the multilinear extension of the function over a down-closed polytope. The approximation guarantee is 0.372 and it is the first improvement over the 1/e approximation achieved by the unified Continuous Greedy algorithm [Feldman et al., FOCS 2011].", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Alina Ene.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ene:Alina", "Huy L.
