We point out that different assumptions about the uncertainty may result in drastically different robust' policy recommendations. Therefore, we develop new methods to analyze uncertainty about the parameters of a model, the lag specification, the serial correlation of shocks, and the effects of real time data in one coherent structure. We consider both parametric and nonparametric specifications of this structure and use them to estimate the uncertainty in a small model of the US economy. We then use our estimates to compute robust Bayesian and minimax monetary policy rules, which are designed to perform well in the face of uncertainty. Our results suggest that the aggressiveness recently found in robust policy rules is likely to be caused by overemphasizing uncertainty about economic dynamics at low frequencies.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Princeton University", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Queensland University of Technology", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Indiana University", "University of Sydney", "University of Ottawa", "Bilkent University", "Bilkent University", "University of Bordeaux", "University of Bordeaux"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Wouter M.
