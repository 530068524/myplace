The focus is on simulations generated from model-based design environments and, in particular, Simulink. The correctness and robustness of the simulation is guaranteed against floating-point rounding errors and system modeling uncertainties. Toward that goal, self-validated arithmetics, such as interval and affine arithmetic, are employed for guaranteed simulation of discrete-time hybrid systems. In the case of continuous-time hybrid systems, self-validated arithmetics are utilized for over-approximations of reachability computations.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Georgios E.
