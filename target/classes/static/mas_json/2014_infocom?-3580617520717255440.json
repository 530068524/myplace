It attempts to enable every node to autonomously localize any failure event in the network in a distributed and all-optical manner by inspecting a set of m-trails traversing through the node. This paper investigates the m-trail allocation problem under the NL-UFL scenario by taking each link and node failure event into consideration. Bound analysis is performed using combinatorial group testing (CGT)\u00a0theory and this is followed by the introduction of a novel heuristic on general topologies. Extensive simulation is conducted to examine the proposed heuristic in terms of the required cover length and the number of m-trails to achieve NL-UFL.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "University of Waterloo", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "University of Waterloo", "George Washington University", "MTA-BME Future  ... dapest, Hungary", "Comput. & Autom ... dapest, Hungary"], "authors": ["J\u00e1nos Tapolcai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tapolcai:J=aacute=nos", "Lajos R\u00f3nyai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=oacute=nyai:Lajos", "\u00c9va Hosszu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosszu:=Eacute=va", "Pin-Han Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Pin=Han", "Suresh Subramaniam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramaniam:Suresh"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
