{"title": "The lonely raccoon at the ball: designing for intimacy, sociability, and selfhood.", "fields": ["user experience design", "self", "maker culture", "scaffold", "social theory"], "abstract": "Designing for sociable systems requires, among other abilities, a sensitivity to the meanings, structures, and nuances of technology-mediated experiences that are simultaneously felt by users to be intimate and also social. Such a sensitivity is not easily acquired, and design researchers have recommended the use of social theories to guide designers' readings of technology-mediated social experiences. We use philosopher Michel Foucault's theory of identity (and social power, discourse, sexuality, creativity, and style) known as \"the care of the self,\" as a scaffold with which to produce a sensitive interpretation of the intimacy (and expert social creative) practices of adult users of the virtual world  Second Life (SL) . This reading sheds light on several skilled and creative intimacy practices in  SL . It also offers a philosophically grounded hermeneutic strategy for designers interested in analyzing intimate experiences.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jeffrey Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Jeffrey", "Shaowen Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Shaowen", "Guo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Guo", "Tyler Pace.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pace:Tyler"], "pages": 10}
