This makes is necessary to develop new algorithms that allow for searching and browsing in those large-scale databases. In this work we explore deep networks for deriving a low-dimensional image representation appropriate for image retrieval. A deep network consisting of multiple layers of features aims to capture higher order correlations between basic image features. We will evaluate our approach on a real world large-scale image database and compare it to image representations based on topic models. Our results show the suitability of the approach for very large databases.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["University of Augsburg", "University of Augsburg"], "authors": ["Eva H\u00f6rster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=rster:Eva", "Rainer Lienhart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lienhart:Rainer"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
