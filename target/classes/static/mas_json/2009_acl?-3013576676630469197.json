{"title": "Coordinate Structure Analysis with Global Structural Constraints and Alignment-Based Local Features.", "fields": ["parsing", "local symmetry", "perceptron", "chart", "sentence"], "abstract": "We propose a hybrid approach to coordinate structure analysis that combines a simple grammar to ensure consistent global structure of coordinations in a sentence, and features based on sequence alignment to capture local symmetry of conjuncts. The weight of the alignment-based features, which in turn determines the score of coordinate structures, is optimized by perceptron training on a given corpus. A bottom-up chart parsing algorithm efficiently finds the best scoring structure, taking both nested or non-overlapping flat coordinations into account. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing parsers in coordination scope detection on the Genia corpus.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kazuo Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hara:Kazuo", "Masashi Shimbo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimbo:Masashi", "Hideharu Okuma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okuma:Hideharu", "Yuji Matsumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsumoto_0001:Yuji"], "pages": 9}
