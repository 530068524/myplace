{"title": "Orderless Tracking through Model-Averaged Posterior Estimation.", "fields": ["online and offline", "estimation theory", "smoothness", "video tracking", "recursion"], "abstract": "We propose a novel offline tracking algorithm based on model-averaged posterior estimation through patch matching across frames. Contrary to existing online and offline tracking methods, our algorithm is not based on temporally-ordered estimates of target state but attempts to select easy-to-track frames first out of the remaining ones without exploiting temporal coherency of target. The posterior of the selected frame is estimated by propagating densities from the already tracked frames in a recursive manner. The density propagation across frames is implemented by an efficient patch matching technique, which is useful for our algorithm since it does not require motion smoothness assumption. Also, we present a hierarchical approach, where a small set of key frames are tracked first and non-key frames are handled by local key frames. Our tracking algorithm is conceptually well-suited for the sequences with abrupt motion, shot changes, and occlusion. We compare our tracking algorithm with existing techniques in real videos with such challenges and illustrate its superior performance qualitatively and quantitatively.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Seunghoon Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Seunghoon", "Suha Kwak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwak:Suha", "Bohyung Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Bohyung"], "pages": 8}
