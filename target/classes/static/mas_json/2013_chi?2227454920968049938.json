{"title": "Three perspectives on behavior change for serious games.", "fields": ["human behavior", "environmental studies", "public engagement", "procedural rhetoric", "behavior change"], "abstract": "Research into the effects of serious games often engages with interdisciplinary models of how human behaviors are shaped and changed over time. To better understand these different perspectives we articulate three cognitive models of behavior change and consider the potential of these models to support a deeper understanding of behavior change in serious games. Two of these models -- Information Deficit and Procedural Rhetoric -- have already been employed in the design of serious games, while the third -- Emergent Dialogue -- is introduced from the field of Environmental Studies. We situate this discussion within a context of designing games for public engagement with issues of environmental sustainability.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Joshua Tanenbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanenbaum:Joshua", "Alissa Nicole Antle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antle:Alissa_Nicole", "John Robinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robinson:John"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
