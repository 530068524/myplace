{"title": "Blame and coercion: together again for the first time.", "fields": ["racket", "typescript", "mathematical proof", "gradual typing", "bisimulation"], "abstract": "C#, Dart, Pyret, Racket, TypeScript, VB: many recent languages integrate dynamic and static types via gradual typing. We systematically develop three calculi for gradual typing and the relations between them, building on and strengthening previous work. The calculi are: \u03bbB, based on the blame calculus of Wadler and Findler (2009); \u03bbC, inspired by the coercion calculus of Henglein (1994); \u03bbS inspired by the space-efficient calculus of Herman, Tomb, and Flanagan (2006) and the threesome calculus of Siek and Wadler (2010). While \u03bbB is little changed from previous work, \u03bbC and \u03bbS are new. Together, \u03bbB, \u03bbC, and \u03bbS provide a coherent foundation for design, implementation, and optimisation of gradual types. We define translations from \u03bbB to \u03bbC and from \u03bbC to \u03bbS. Much previous work lacked proofs of correctness or had weak correctness criteria; here we demonstrate the strongest correctness criterion one could hope for, that each of the translations is fully abstract. Each of the calculi reinforces the design of the others: \u03bbC has a particularly simple definition, and the subtle definition of blame safety for \u03bbB is justified by the simple definition of blame safety for \u03bbC. Our calculus \u03bbS is implementation-ready: the first space-efficient calculus that is both straightforward to implement and easy to understand. We give two applications: first, using full abstraction from \u03bbC to \u03bbS to validate the challenging part of full abstraction between \u03bbB and \u03bbC; and, second, using full abstraction from \u03bbB to \u03bbS to easily establish the Fundamental Property of Casts, which required a custom bisimulation and six lemmas in earlier work.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Indiana University", "University of Freiburg", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Jeremy G.
