Like in other Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) programs, users evolve images on Picbreeder by selecting ones that appeal to them to produce a new generation. However, Picbreeder also offers an online community in which to share these images, and most importantly, the ability to  continue  evolving others' images. Through this process of branching from other images, and through continually increasing image complexity made possible by the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm, evolved images proliferate unlike in any other current IEC systems. Participation requires no explicit talent from the users, thereby opening Picbreeder to the entire Internet community. This paper details how Picbreeder encourages innovation, featuring images that were collaboratively evolved.", "citation": "Citations (179)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jimmy Secretan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Secretan:Jimmy", "Nicholas Beato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beato:Nicholas"], "pages": 10}
