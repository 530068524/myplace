We propose a minimally supervised bootstrapping algorithm that uses a single seed and a recursive lexico-syntactic pattern to learn the arguments and the supertypes of a diverse set of semantic relations from the Web. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on multiple semantic relations expressed using \"verb\", \"noun\", and \"verb prep\" lexico-syntactic patterns. Human-based evaluation shows that the accuracy of the harvested information is about 90%. We also compare our results with existing knowledge base to outline the similarities and differences of the granularity and diversity of the harvested knowledge.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Information Sciences Institute", "Information Sciences Institute"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zornitsa Kozareva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozareva:Zornitsa", "Eduard H.
