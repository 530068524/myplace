We circumvent the non-convex optimization problem using improper learning: carefully overparameterize the class of LDSs by a polylogarithmic factor, in exchange for convexity of the loss functions. From this arises a polynomial-time algorithm with a near-optimal regret guarantee, with an analogous sample complexity bound for agnostic learning. Our algorithm is based on a novel filtering technique, which may be of independent interest: we convolve the time series with the eigenvectors of a certain Hankel matrix.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad", "Karan Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Karan", "Cyril Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Cyril"], "pages": 11}
