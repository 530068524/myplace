While large, manually collected datasets exist, the captured variations w.r.t. appearance, shape and pose are often uncontrolled thus limiting the overall performance. In order to overcome this limitation we propose a new technique to extend an existing training set that allows to explicitly control pose and shape variations. For this we build on recent advances in computer graphics to generate samples with realistic appearance and background while modifying body shape and pose. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of articulated human detection and articulated pose estimation. We report close to state of the art results on the popular Image Parsing [25] human pose estimation benchmark and demonstrate superior performance for articulated human detection. In addition we define a new challenge of combined articulated human detection and pose estimation in real-world scenes.", "citation": "Citations (162)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Leonid Pishchulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pishchulin:Leonid", "Arjun Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Arjun", "Mykhaylo Andriluka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andriluka:Mykhaylo", "Thorsten Thorm\u00e4hlen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thorm=auml=hlen:Thorsten", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "pages": 8}
