{"title": "Scaling distributed cache hierarchies through computation and data co-scheduling.", "fields": ["distributed cache", "cache algorithms", "cache", "speedup", "cache pollution"], "abstract": "Cache hierarchies are increasingly non-uniform, so for systems to scale efficiently, data must be close to the threads that use it. Moreover, cache capacity is limited and contended among threads, introducing complex capacity/latency tradeoffs. Prior NUCA schemes have focused on managing data to reduce access latency, but have ignored thread placement; and applying prior NUMA thread placement schemes to NUCA is inefficient, as capacity, not bandwidth, is the main constraint. We present CDCS, a technique to jointly place threads and data in multicores with distributed shared caches. We develop novel monitoring hardware that enables fine-grained space allocation on large caches, and data movement support to allow frequent full-chip reconfigurations. On a 64-core system, CDCS outperforms an S-NUCA LLC by 46% on average (up to 76%) in weighted speedup and saves 36% of system energy. CDCS also outperforms state-of-the-art NUCA schemes under different thread scheduling policies.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Nathan Beckmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beckmann:Nathan", "Po-An Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Po=An", "Daniel S\u00e1nchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=aacute=nchez_0003:Daniel"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
