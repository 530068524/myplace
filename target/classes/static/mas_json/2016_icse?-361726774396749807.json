{"title": "Efficient large-scale trace checking using mapreduce.", "fields": ["scalability", "bounded function", "well founded semantics", "temporal logic", "parametric statistics"], "abstract": "The problem of checking a logged event trace against a temporal logic specification arises in many practical cases. Unfortunately, known algorithms for an expressive logic like MTL (Metric Temporal Logic) do not scale with respect to two crucial dimensions: the length of the trace and the size of the time interval of the formula to be checked. The former issue can be addressed by distributed and parallel trace checking algorithms that can take advantage of modern cloud computing and programming frameworks like MapReduce. Still, the latter issue remains open with current state-of-the-art approaches.   In this paper we address this memory scalability issue by proposing a new semantics for MTL, called  lazy  semantics. This semantics can evaluate temporal formulae and boolean combinations of temporal-only formulae at any arbitrary time instant. We prove that  lazy  semantics is more expressive than point-based semantics and that it can be used as a basis for a correct parametric decomposition of any MTL formula into an equivalent one with smaller, bounded time intervals. We use  lazy  semantics to extend our previous distributed trace checking algorithm for MTL. The evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm can check formulae with large intervals, on large traces, in a memory-efficient way.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "University of Luxembourg", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Marcello M.
