Some studies have been done to model user preferences for visual recommendation. Usually, an item consists of two fundamental components:  style  and  category . Conventional methods model items in a common visual feature space. In these methods, visual representations always can only capture the categorical information but fail in capturing the styles of items. Style information indicates the preferences of users and has significant effect in visual recommendation. Accordingly, we propose a DeepStyle method for learning style features of items and sensing preferences of users. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness of DeepStyle for visual recommendation.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Qiang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0006:Qiang", "Shu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Shu", "Liang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Liang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
