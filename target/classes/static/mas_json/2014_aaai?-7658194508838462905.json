To this end, we employ the instance-specific algorithm configurator ISAC, and improve it with the latest in portfolio technology. Experimental results on SAT show that this combination marks a significant step forward in our ability to tune algorithms instance-specifically. We then apply the new methodology to a number of MaxSAT problem domains and show that the resulting solvers consistently outperform the best existing solvers on the respective problem families. In fact, the solvers presented here were independently evaluated at the 2013 MaxSAT Evaluation where they won six of the eleven categories.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Lleida", "University College Cork", "IBM", "University of Lleida", "University of Lleida", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Carlos Ans\u00f3tegui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ans=oacute=tegui:Carlos", "Yuri Malitsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malitsky:Yuri", "Meinolf Sellmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sellmann:Meinolf"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
