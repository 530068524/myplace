However, the intrinsic directionality and limited field-of-view of 60 GHz antennas make the links extremely sensitive to user mobility and orientation change. Hence, seamless coverage, even at room level, becomes challenging. In this paper, we propose Pia, a robust 60 GHz network architecture that can provide seamless coverage and mobility support at multi-Gbps bitrate. Pia comprises multiple cooperating access points (APs). It leverages the pose information on mobile clients to proactively select the AP and manage multi-link spatial reuse. These decisions require a model of the pose/location of the APs and ambient reflectors. We address these challenges through a set of AP-pose sensing and compressive angle estimation algorithms that fuse the pose measurement with link quality measurement on the client. We have implemented Pia using commodity 60 GHz platforms. Our experiments show that Pia reduces the occurrence of link outage by 6.3x and improves the spatial sharing capacity by 76%, compared to conventional schemes that only use in-band information for adaptation.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Teng Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Teng", "Xinyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xinyu"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
