{"title": "Bounded Cycle Synthesis.", "fields": ["implementation", "bounded function", "tree automaton", "temporal logic", "witness"], "abstract": "We introduce a new approach for the synthesis of Mealy machines from specifications in linear-time temporal logic (LTL), where the number of cycles in the state graph of the implementation is limited by a given bound. Bounding the number of cycles leads to implementations that are structurally simpler and easier to understand. We solve the synthesis problem via an extension of SAT-based bounded synthesis, where we additionally construct a witness structure that limits the number of cycles. We also establish a triple-exponential upper and lower bound for the potential blow-up between the length of the LTL formula and the number of cycles in the state graph.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Bernd Finkbeiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finkbeiner:Bernd", "Felix Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein_0001:Felix"], "pages": 18}
