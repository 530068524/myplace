We focus on the majority aggregation of the individual CP-nets, which is the CP-net where the direction of each edge of the hypercube is decided according to the majority rule. First we focus on hypercube Condorcet winners (HCWs); in particular, we show that, assuming a uniform distribution for the CP-nets, the probability that there exists at least one HCWis at least 1-1/e, and the expected number of HCWs is 1. Our experimental results confirm these results. We also show experimental results under the Impartial Culture assumption. We then generalize a few tournament solutions to select winners from (weighted) majoritarian CP-nets, namely Copeland, maximin, and Kemeny. For each of these, we address some social choice theoretic and computational issues.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Duke University", "Paris Dauphine University", "Duke University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Vincent Conitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conitzer:Vincent", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Lirong Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Lirong"], "pages": 6}
