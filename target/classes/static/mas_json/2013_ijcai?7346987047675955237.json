It is known that $\\text{\\sffamily RML}$ has the same expressiveness as $\\text{\\sffamily ML}$, but the translation of $\\text{\\sffamily RML}$ into $\\text{\\sffamily ML}$ is of non-elementary complexity, and $\\text{\\sffamily RML}$ is at least doubly exponentially more succinct than $\\text{\\sffamily ML}$. In this paper, we show that $\\text{\\sffamily RML}$-satisfiability is 'only' singly exponentially harder than $\\text{\\sffamily ML}$-satisfiability, the latter being a well-known PSPACE-complete problem. More precisely, we establish that $\\text{\\sffamily RML}$-satisfiability is complete for the complexity class AEXP$_{\\text{\\sffamily pol}}$, i.e., the class of problems solvable by alternating Turing machines running in single exponential time but only with a polynomial number of alternations (note that NEXPTIME\u2286 AEXP$_{\\text{\\sffamily pol}}$\u2286 EXPSPACE).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Technical University of Madrid", "University of Seville", "University of Rennes", "Technical University of Madrid", "University of Lorraine", "University of Rennes", "Technical University of Madrid", "University of Lorraine", "University of Rennes"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Laura Bozzelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bozzelli:Laura", "Hans van Ditmarsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ditmarsch:Hans_van", "Sophie Pinchinat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinchinat:Sophie"], "pages": 5}
