When leadership is distributed effectively, the result can be success stories like Wikipedia and Linux. However, finding a successful distribution is challenging. In the online community Newgrounds, hundreds of collaborative animation projects called \"collabs\" are started each year, but less than 20% are completed. We suggest that many collabs fail because leaders are overburdened and lack adequate technological support. We introduce Pipeline, a collaboration tool designed to support and transform leadership, with the goal of easing the burden on leaders of online creative projects. Through a case study of a six-week, 30-artist collaboration called Holiday Flood, we show how Pipeline supported redistributed leadership. We conclude with implications for theory and the design of social computing systems.", "citation": "Citations (39)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kurt Luther.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luther:Kurt", "Casey Fiesler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiesler:Casey", "Amy Bruckman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruckman:Amy"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 16}
