It is known that in the regime where the scheduling reconfiguration delay is non-negligible, the rate of schedule reconfiguration should be limited in such a way as to minimize the impact of reduced duty-cycles and to ensure bounded delay. However, when the scheduling rate is restricted, the existing literature also tends to restrict the rate of monitoring and decision processes. We first present a framework for scheduling with reconfiguration delay that decouples the rate of scheduling from the rate of monitoring. Under this framework, we then present two scheduling algorithms for switches with reconfiguration delay, both based on the well-known MaxWeight scheduling policy. The first one is the Periodic MaxWeight (PMW), which is simpler in computation, but requires prior knowledge of traffic load. The other is the Adaptive MaxWeight (AMW), which, in contrast, requires no prior knowledge. We show the stability condition for both algorithms and evaluate their delay performance through simulations.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Chang-Heng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chang=Heng", "Tara Javidi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Javidi:Tara", "George Porter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Porter:George"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
