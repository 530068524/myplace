{"title": "CiAO: An Aspect-Oriented Operating-System Family for Resource-Constrained Embedded Systems.", "fields": ["system software", "autosar", "separation of concerns", "resource consumption", "preprocessor"], "abstract": "This paper evaluates aspect-oriented programming (AOP) as a first-class concept for implementing configurability in system software for resource-constrained embedded systems. To compete against proprietary special-purpose solutions, system software for this domain has to be highly configurable. Such fine-grained configurability is usually implemented \"in-line\" by means of the C preprocessor. However, this approach does not scale - it quickly leads to \"#ifdef hell\" and a bad separation of concerns. At the same time, the challenges of configurability are still increasing. AUTOSAR OS, the state-of-the-art operating-system standard from the domain of automotive embedded systems, requires configurability of even fundamental architectural system policies.\n\nOn the example of our CiAO operating-system family and the AUTOSAR-OS standard, we demonstrate that AOP - if applied from the very beginning - is a profound answer to these challenges. Our results show that a well-directed, pragmatic application of AOP leads to a much better separation of concerns than does #ifdef-based configuration - without compromising on resource consumption. The suggested approach of aspect-aware operating-system development facilitates providing even fundamental system policies as configurable features.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "departments": ["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "Technical University of Dortmund", "Technical University of Dortmund"], "authors": ["Daniel Lohmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lohmann:Daniel", "Wanja Hofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofer:Wanja", "Wolfgang Schr\u00f6der-Preikschat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schr=ouml=der=Preikschat:Wolfgang", "Jochen Streicher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Streicher:Jochen", "Olaf Spinczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spinczyk:Olaf"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2009", "pages": -1}
