The learned bases provide a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data point x on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination of its nearby anchor points, and the linear weights become its local coordinate coding. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning problem into a simple global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional local learning methods.", "citation": "Citations (720)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "NEC Laboratories America", "NEC Laboratories America"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kai Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Kai", "Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Tong", "Yihong Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Yihong"], "pages": 9}
