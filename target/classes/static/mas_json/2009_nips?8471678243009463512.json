{"title": "Quantification and the language of thought.", "fields": ["concept learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "Many researchers have suggested that the psychological complexity of a concept is related to the length of its representation in a language of thought. As yet, however, there are few concrete proposals about the nature of this language. This paper makes one such proposal: the language of thought allows first order quantification (quantification over objects) more readily than second-order quantification (quantification over features). To support this proposal we present behavioral results from a concept learning study inspired by the work of Shepard, Hovland and Jenkins.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Charles Kemp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kemp:Charles"], "pages": 9}
