{"title": "Distributed Parameter Estimation via Pseudo-likelihood .", "fields": ["distributed algorithm", "distributed learning", "linear combination", "computation", "estimator"], "abstract": "Estimating statistical models within sensor networks requires distributed algorithms, in which both data and computation are distributed across the nodes of the network. We propose a general approach for distributed learning based on combining local estimators defined by pseudo-likelihood components, encompassing a number of combination methods, and provide both theoretical and experimental analysis. We show that simple linear combination or max-voting methods, when combined with second-order information, are statistically competitive with more advanced and costly joint optimization. Our algorithms have many attractive properties including low communication and computational cost and \"any-time\" behavior.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Qiang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Qiang", "Alexander T.
