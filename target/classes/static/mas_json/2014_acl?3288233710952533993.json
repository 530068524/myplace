{"title": "Omni-word Feature and Soft Constraint for Chinese Relation Extraction.", "fields": ["parsing", "lexicon", "text segmentation", "relationship extraction", "sentence"], "abstract": "Chinese is an ancient hieroglyphic. It is inattentive to structure. Therefore, segmenting and parsing Chinese are more difficult and less accurate. In this paper, we propose an Omniword feature and a soft constraint method for Chinese relation extraction. The Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature, reducing errors caused by word segmentation. In order to utilize the structure information of a relation instance, we discuss how soft constraint can be used to capture the local dependency. Both Omni-word feature and soft constraint make a better use of sentence information and minimize the influences caused by Chinese word segmentation and parsing. We test these methods on the ACE 2005 RDC Chinese corpus. The results show a significant improvement in Chinese relation extraction, outperforming other methods in F-score by 10% in 6 relation types and 15% in 18 relation subtypes.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Amazon.com"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yanping Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0007:Yanping", "Qinghua Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Qinghua", "Wei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0053:Wei"], "pages": 10}
