Because it is data-oblivious and deterministic, Zig-zag Sort can be implemented as a simple  O ( n  log  n )-size sorting network, thereby providing a solution to an open problem posed by Incerpi and Sedgewick in 1985. In addition, Zig-zag Sort is a variant of Shellsort, and is, in fact, the first deterministic Shellsort variant running in  O ( n  log  n ) time. The existence of such an algorithm was posed as an open problem by Plaxton  et al . in 1992 and also by Sedgewick in 1996. More relevant for today is the fact that the existence of a simple data-oblivious deterministic sorting algorithm running in  O ( n  log  n ) time simplifies the \"inner-loop\" computation in several proposed oblivious-RAM simulation methods (which utilize AKS sorting networks), and this, in turn, implies simplified mechanisms for privacy-preserving data outsourcing in several cloud computing applications.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Michael T.
