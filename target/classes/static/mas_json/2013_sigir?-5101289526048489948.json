However, it's still unknown that to what extent people's friend-making behaviors follow this principle and to what extent it can benefit the link prediction task.   In this paper, we try to adopt this sociological principle to explain the evolution of networks and study the latent friendship propagation. Unlike traditional link prediction approaches, we model link formation as results of individuals' friend-making behaviors combined with personal interests. We propose the Latent Friendship Propagation Network (LFPN), which depicts the evolution progress of one's egocentric network and reveals future growth potentials driven by the transitivity of friendship based on personal interests. We model individuals' social behaviors using the Latent Friendship Propagation Model (LFPM), a probabilistic generative model from which the LFPN can be learned effectively. To evaluate the power of the friendship propagation in link prediction, we design LFPN-RW which models the friend-making behavior as a random walk upon the LFPN naturally and captures the co-influence effect of the friend circles as well as personal interests to provide more accurate prediction.   Experimental results on real-world datasets show that LFPN-RW outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. This convinces that the transitivity of friendship actually plays important roles in the evolution of social networks.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jun", "Chaokun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chaokun", "Philip S.
