The platform uses the wizard design pattern to guide users through the process of creating a game. We describe the platform in detail and report our findings from deploying it within a large global organization for a period of three months, in which 34 games were created by 25 employees and played by 339. We combine qualitative and quantitative analysis to understand the characteristics of the different games and their impact on popularity and engagement, to validate our design goals, and to suggest potential enhancements.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "IBM", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ido Guy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guy:Ido", "Anat Hashavit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hashavit:Anat", "Yaniv Corem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Corem:Yaniv"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
