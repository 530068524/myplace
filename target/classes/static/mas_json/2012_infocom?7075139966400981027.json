In this paper, we develop and validate a simple mixed queueing network model of user mobility among access points in a campus network. We identify two classes of users, an open and a closed class, corresponding to mobile users that visit the network for a short time before departure, and users that are always resident in the network during the observation period. Using CRAWDAD traces of user-access-point affiliation over time, we compare model-predicted performance with the performance actually observed in the traces, and find that such a mixed queueing model can indeed be used to accurately predict a number of performance measures of interest.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Yung-Chih Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yung=Chih", "Jim Kurose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurose:Jim", "Don Towsley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Towsley:Don"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
