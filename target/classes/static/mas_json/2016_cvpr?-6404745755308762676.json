Our framework is formulated on top of a least squares SVM (LS-SVM) classifier, which is simple and fast in both training and testing, and achieves competitive performance in practice. The regularization parameters in LS-SVM is estimated automatically without grid search and cross-validation by maximizing evidence, which is a useful measure to select the best performing CNN out of multiple candidates for transfer learning, the evidence is optimized efficiently by employing Aitken's delta-squared process, which accelerates convergence of fixed point update. The proposed Bayesian evidence framework also provides a good solution to identify the best ensemble of heterogeneous CNNs through a greedy algorithm. Our Bayesian evidence framework for transfer learning is tested on 12 visual recognition datasets and illustrates the state-of-the-art performance consistently in terms of prediction accuracy and modeling efficiency.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yong-Deok Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Yong=Deok", "Taewoong Jang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jang:Taewoong", "Bohyung Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Bohyung", "Seungjin Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Seungjin"], "pages": 9}
