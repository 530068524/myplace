One of the approaches used to endow agents with this capability is the weighted model counting approach. Given a plan library and a sequence of observations, this approach exhaustively enumerates plan execution models that are consistent with the observed behaviour. The probability that the agent might be pursuing a particular goal is then computed as a proportion of plan execution models satisfying the goal. The approach allows to recognize multiple interleaved plans, but suffers from a combinatorial explosion of plan execution models, which impedes its application to real-world domains. This paper presents a heuristic weighted model counting algorithm that limits the number of generated plan execution models in order to recognize goals quickly by computing their lower and upper bound likelihoods.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke", "Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke", "Defence R&D Can ... ec, QC, Canada", "Defence R&D Can ... ec, QC, Canada"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Froduald Kabanza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kabanza:Froduald", "Julien Filion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filion:Julien", "Abder Rezak Benaskeur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benaskeur:Abder_Rezak", "Hengameh Irandoust.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irandoust:Hengameh"], "pages": 7}
