{"title": "Partners in Care: Design Considerations for Caregivers and Patients During a Hospital Stay.", "fields": ["negotiation", "behavior change", "social computing", "computer supported cooperative work", "health informatics"], "abstract": "Informal caregivers, such as close friends and family, play an important role in a hospital patient\u00e2  s care. Although CSCW researchers have shown the potential for social computing technologies to help patients and their caregivers manage chronic conditions and support health behavior change, few studies focus on caregivers\u00e2   role during a multi-day hospital stay. To explore this space, we conducted an interview and observation study of patients and caregivers in the inpatient setting. In this paper, we describe how caregivers and patients coordinate and collaborate to manage patients\u00e2   care and wellbeing during a hospital stay. We define and describe five roles caregivers adopt: companion, assistant, representative, navigator, and planner, and show how patients and caregivers negotiate these roles and responsibilities throughout a hospital stay. Finally, we identify key design considerations for technology to support patients and caregivers during a hospital stay.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Andrew D.
