{"title": "Dual-Feature Warping-Based Motion Model Estimation.", "fields": ["image warping", "image stitching", "line segment", "homography", "image stabilization"], "abstract": "To break down the geometry assumptions of traditional motion models (e.g., homography, affine), warping-based motion model recently becomes very popular and is adopted in many latest applications (e.g., image stitching, video stabilization). With high degrees of freedom, the accuracy of model heavily relies on data-terms (keypoint correspondences). In some low-texture environments (e.g., indoor) where keypoint feature is insufficient or unreliable, the warping model is often erroneously estimated. In this paper we propose a simple and effective approach by considering both keypoint and line segment correspondences as data-term. Line segment is a prominent feature in artificial environments and it can supply sufficient geometrical and structural information of scenes, which not only helps guild to a correct warp in low-texture condition, but also prevents the undesired distortion induced by warping. The combination aims to complement each other and benefit for a wider range of scenes. Our method is general and can be ported to many existing applications. Experiments demonstrate that using dual-feature yields more robust and accurate result especially for those low-texture images.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Shiwei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shiwei", "Lu Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Lu", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian", "Long Quan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quan:Long"], "pages": 9}
