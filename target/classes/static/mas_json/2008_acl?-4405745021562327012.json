{"title": "Forest Reranking: Discriminative Parsing with Non-Local Features.", "fields": ["inference", "treebank", "natural language processing", "discriminative model", "parsing"], "abstract": "Conventional n-best reranking techniques often suffer from the limited scope of the nbest list, which rules out many potentially good alternatives. We instead propose forest reranking, a method that reranks a packed forest of exponentially many parses. Since exact inference is intractable with non-local features, we present an approximate algorithm inspired by forest rescoring that makes discriminative training practical over the whole Treebank. Our final result, an F-score of 91.7, outperforms both 50-best and 100-best reranking baselines, and is better than any previously reported systems trained on the Treebank.", "citation": "Citations (269)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Liang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Liang"], "pages": 9}
