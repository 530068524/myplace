This new definition provides robust and efficient composition guarantees, supports powerful algorithmic techniques such as privacy amplification via sub-sampling, and enables more accurate statistical analyses. In particular, we show a central task for which the new definition enables exponential accuracy improvement.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Harvard University", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "IBM"], "authors": ["Mark Bun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bun:Mark", "Cynthia Dwork.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dwork:Cynthia", "Guy N.
