{"title": "Globally Normalized Transition-Based Neural Networks.", "fields": ["transition system", "artificial neural network", "normalization", "dependency grammar", "sentence"], "abstract": "We introduce a globally normalized transition-based neural network model that achieves state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and sentence compression results. Our model is a simple feed-forward neural network that operates on a task-specific transition system, yet achieves comparable or better accuracies than recurrent models. We discuss the importance of global as opposed to local normalization: a key insight is that the label bias problem implies that globally normalized models can be strictly more expressive than locally normalized models.", "citation": "Citations (272)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "University of Trento"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Daniel Andor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andor:Daniel", "Chris Alberti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alberti:Chris", "David Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:David", "Aliaksei Severyn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Severyn:Aliaksei", "Alessandro Presta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Presta:Alessandro", "Kuzman Ganchev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganchev:Kuzman", "Slav Petrov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrov:Slav", "Michael Collins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collins_0001:Michael"], "pages": -1}
