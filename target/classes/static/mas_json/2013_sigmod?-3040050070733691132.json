{"title": "Toward practical query pricing with QueryMarket.", "fields": ["query optimization", "data mining", "leverage", "integer programming", "revenue"], "abstract": "We develop a new pricing system, QueryMarket, for flexible query pricing in a data market based on an earlier theoretical framework (Koutris et al., PODS 2012). To build such a system, we show how to use an Integer Linear Programming formulation of the pricing problem for a large class of queries, even when pricing is computationally hard. Further, we leverage query history to avoid double charging when queries purchased over time have overlapping information, or when the database is updated. We then present a technique that fairly shares revenue when multiple sellers are involved. Finally, we implement our approach in a prototype and evaluate its performance on several query workloads.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Paraschos Koutris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koutris:Paraschos", "Prasang Upadhyaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Upadhyaya:Prasang", "Magdalena Balazinska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balazinska:Magdalena", "Bill Howe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Howe:Bill", "Dan Suciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suciu:Dan"], "pages": 12}
