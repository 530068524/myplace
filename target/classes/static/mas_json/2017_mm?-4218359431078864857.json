In particular, the tracked object is represented with a graph with image patches as nodes. This graph is dynamically learned from two aspects. First, the graph affinity (i.e., graph structure and edge weights) that indicates the appearance compatibility of two neighboring nodes is optimized based on the weighted sparse representation, in which the modality weight is introduced to leverage RGB and thermal information adaptively. Second, each node weight that indicates how likely it belongs to the foreground is propagated from others along with graph affinity. The optimized patch weights are then imposed on the extracted RGB and thermal features, and the target object is finally located by adopting the structured SVM algorithm. Moreover, we also contribute a comprehensive dataset for RGB-T tracking purpose. Comparing with existing ones, the new dataset has the following advantages: 1) Its size is sufficiently large for large-scale performance evaluation (total frame number: 210K, maximum frames per video pair: 8K). 2) The alignment between RGB-T video pairs is highly accurate, which does not need pre- and post-processing. 3) The occlusion levels are annotated for analyzing the occlusion-sensitive performance of different methods. Extensive experiments on both public and newly created datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracker against several state-of-the-art tracking methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Anhui University", "Anhui University", "Texas State University", "Anhui University", "Anhui University"], "authors": ["Chenglong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0002:Chenglong", "Nan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Nan", "Yijuan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yijuan", "Chengli Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Chengli", "Jin Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jin"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
