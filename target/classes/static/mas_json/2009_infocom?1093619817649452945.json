{"title": "Routing Fairness in Chord: Analysis and Enhancement.", "fields": ["peer to peer", "chord", "resource allocation", "selection algorithm"], "abstract": "In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems where stored objects are small, routing dominates the cost of publishing and retrieving an object. In such systems, the issue of fairly balancing the routing load among all nodes becomes critical. In this paper we address this issue for Chord-based P2P systems. We first present an analytical model to evaluate the routing fairness of Chord based on the well accepted Jain's Fairness Index (FI). Our model shows that Chord performs poorly, with a FI around 0.6, mainly due to the different sizes of the zones between nodes. Following this observation, we propose a simple enhancement to the Chord finger selection algorithm with the goal of mitigating this effect. The key advantage of our proposal as compared to previous approaches is that it does not add any overhead to the basic Chord algorithm. The proposed approach is evaluated analytically showing a very substantial improvement over Chord, with a FI around 0.9. We conduct an extensive large-scale simulation study to evaluate our proposal and validate the analysis. The simulation study includes, among other aspects, churn conditions, heterogeneous nodes and Zipf-like object popularity.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Carlos III Health Institute", "Carlos III Health Institute", "Carlos III Health Institute"], "authors": ["Rub\u00e9n Cuevas Rum\u00edn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rum=iacute=n:Rub=eacute=n_Cuevas", "Manuel Urue\u00f1a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urue=ntilde=a:Manuel", "Albert Banchs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banchs:Albert"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
