Our primary contribution is to describe new generative models that are tailored to NSC. The models are based on probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) and neuro-probabilistic language models (Mnih & Teh, 2012), which are extended to incorporate additional source code-specific structure. These models can be efficiently trained on a corpus of source code and outperform a variety of less structured baselines in terms of predictive log likelihoods on held-out data.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Chris J.
