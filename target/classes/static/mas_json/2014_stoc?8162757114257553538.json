{"title": "A quantum algorithm for computing the unit group of an arbitrary degree number field.", "fields": ["quantum sort", "quantum t design", "fundamental unit", "quantum fourier transform", "quantum phase estimation algorithm"], "abstract": "Computing the group of units in a field of algebraic numbers is one of the central tasks of computational algebraic number theory. It is believed to be hard classically, which is of interest for cryptography. In the quantum setting, efficient algorithms were previously known for fields of constant degree. We give a quantum algorithm that is polynomial in the degree of the field and the logarithm of its discriminant. This is achieved by combining three new results. The first is a classical algorithm for computing a basis for certain ideal lattices with doubly exponentially large generators. The second shows that a Gaussian-weighted superposition of lattice points, with an appropriate encoding, can be used to provide a unique representation of a real-valued lattice. The third is an extension of the hidden subgroup problem to continuous groups and a quantum algorithm for solving the HSP over the group R  n  .", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Kirsten Eisentr\u00e4ger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisentr=auml=ger:Kirsten", "Sean Hallgren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hallgren:Sean", "Alexei Y.
