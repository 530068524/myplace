To this end, we design a temporal description logic, TQL, that extends the standard ontology language OWL2QL, provides basic means for temporal conceptual modelling and ensures first-order rewritability of conjunctive queries for suitably defined data instances with validity time.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Birkbeck, University of London", "University of Liverpool", "Birkbeck, University of London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Alessandro Artale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Artale:Alessandro", "Roman Kontchakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontchakov:Roman", "Frank Wolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolter:Frank", "Michael Zakharyaschev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zakharyaschev:Michael"], "pages": 7}
