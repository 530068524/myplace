{"title": "A comparative study of two network-based anomaly detection methods.", "fields": ["operator", "anomaly detection", "wavelet", "automation", "spatial correlation"], "abstract": "Modern networks are complex and hence, network operators often rely on automation to assist in assuring the security, availability, and performance of these networks. At the core of many of these systems are general-purpose anomaly-detection algorithms that seek to identify normal behavior and detect deviations. While the number and variations of these algorithms are large, two broad categories have emerged as leading approaches to this problem: those based on spatial correlation and those based on temporal analysis. In this paper, we compare one promising approach from each of these categories, namely entropy-based PCA and HHH-based wavelets.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Yahoo!", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Kaustubh Nyalkalkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nyalkalkar:Kaustubh", "Sushant Sinha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinha:Sushant", "Michael Bailey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bailey:Michael", "Farnam Jahanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jahanian:Farnam"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
