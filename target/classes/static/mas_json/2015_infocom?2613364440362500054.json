{"title": "An empirical mixture model for large-scale RTT measurements.", "fields": ["data set", "graph", "the internet", "mixture model", "computer network"], "abstract": "Monitoring delays in the Internet is essential to understand the network condition and ensure the good functioning of time-sensitive applications. Large-scale measurements of round-trip time (RTT) are promising data sources to gain better insights into Internet-wide delays. However, the lack of efficient methodology to model RTTs prevents researchers from leveraging the value of these datasets. In this work, we propose a log-normal mixture model to identify, characterize, and monitor spatial and temporal dynamics of RTTs. This data-driven approach provides a coarse grained view of numerous RTTs in the form of a graph, thus, it enables efficient and systematic analysis of Internet-wide measurements. Using this model, we analyze more than 13 years of RTTs from about 12 millions unique IP addresses in passively measured backbone traffic traces. We evaluate the proposed method by comparison with external data sets, and present examples where the proposed model highlights interesting delay fluctuations due to route changes or congestion. We also introduce an application based on the proposed model to identify hosts deviating from their typical RTTs fluctuations, and we envision various applications for this empirical model.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics"], "authors": ["Romain Fontugne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fontugne:Romain", "Johan Mazel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazel:Johan", "Kensuke Fukuda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukuda:Kensuke"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
