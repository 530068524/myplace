{"title": "Learning to Track for Spatio-Temporal Action Localization.", "fields": ["computer vision", "machine learning", "pattern recognition", "artificial intelligence", "histogram"], "abstract": "We propose an effective approach for spatio-temporal action localization in realistic videos. The approach first detects proposals at the frame-level and scores them with a combination of static and motion CNN features. It then tracks high-scoring proposals throughout the video using a tracking-by-detection approach. Our tracker relies simultaneously on instance-level and class-level detectors. The tracks are scored using a spatio-temporal motion histogram, a descriptor at the track level, in combination with the CNN features. Finally, we perform temporal localization of the action using a sliding-window approach at the track level. We present experimental results for spatio-temporal localization on the UCF-Sports, J-HMDB and UCF-101 action localization datasets, where our approach outperforms the state of the art with a margin of 15%, 7% and 12% respectively in mAP.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Philippe Weinzaepfel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weinzaepfel:Philippe", "Za\u00efd Harchaoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harchaoui:Za=iuml=d", "Cordelia Schmid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmid:Cordelia"], "pages": 9}
