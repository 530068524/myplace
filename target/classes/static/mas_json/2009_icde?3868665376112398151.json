Examples include differing address formats, or different reported latitude/longitudes for a given address. In this paper, we define metric functional dependencies, which strictly generalize traditional FDs by allowing small differences (controlled by a metric) in values of the consequent attribute of an FD. We present efficient algorithms for the verification problem: determining whether a given metric FD holds for a given relation. We experimentally demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our approach on various data sets that lie in multidimensional spaces.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Utah", "AT&T Labs", "University of Utah", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Chemnitz University of Technology", "Massey University", "Massey University"], "authors": ["Nick Koudas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koudas:Nick", "Avishek Saha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saha:Avishek", "Divesh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Divesh", "Suresh Venkatasubramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkatasubramanian:Suresh"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
