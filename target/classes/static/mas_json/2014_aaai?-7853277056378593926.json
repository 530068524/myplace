{"title": "Scalable Sparse Covariance Estimation via Self-Concordance.", "fields": ["estimation of covariance matrices", "lipschitz continuity", "concordance", "convex optimization", "scalability"], "abstract": "We consider the class of convex minimization problems, composed of a self-concordant function, such as the log det metric, a convex data fidelity term h(\u010b) and, a regularizing - possibly non-smooth - function g(\u010b). This type of problems have recently attracted a great deal of interest, mainly due to their omnipresence in top-notch applications. Under this locally Lipschitz continuous gradient setting, we analyze the convergence behavior of proximal Newton schemes with the added twist of a probable presence of inexact evaluations. We prove attractive convergence rate guarantees and enhance state-of-the-art optimization schemes to accommodate such developments. Experimental results on sparse covariance estimation show the merits of our algorithm, both in terms of recovery efficiency and complexity.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Anastasios Kyrillidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kyrillidis:Anastasios", "Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahabadi:Rabeeh_Karimi", "Quoc Tran-Dinh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran=Dinh:Quoc", "Volkan Cevher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cevher:Volkan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
