Although results in supervised and reinforcement learning show that transfer may significantly improve the learning performance, most of the literature on transfer is focused on batch learning tasks. In this paper we study the problem of sequential transfer in online learning, notably in the multi-armed bandit framework, where the objective is to minimize the total regret over a sequence of tasks by transferring knowledge from prior tasks. We introduce a novel bandit algorithm based on a method-of-moments approach for estimating the possible tasks and derive regret bounds for it.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azar:Mohammad_Gheshlaghi", "Alessandro Lazaric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazaric:Alessandro", "Emma Brunskill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brunskill:Emma"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
