The goal of the learner is to find a classifier with a low generalization error in the decision space. We consider a new version of empirical risk minimization algorithm, called Privileged ERM, that takes into account the privileged information in order to find a good function in the decision space. We outline the conditions on the correcting space that, if satisfied, allow Privileged ERM to have much faster learning rate in the decision space than the one of the regular empirical risk minimization.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Dmitry Pechyony.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pechyony:Dmitry", "Vladimir Vapnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vapnik:Vladimir"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
