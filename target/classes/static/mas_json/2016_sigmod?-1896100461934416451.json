{"title": "Distributed Evaluation of Top-k Temporal Joins.", "fields": ["replication", "exploit", "temporal database", "joins", "ranking"], "abstract": "We study a particular kind of join, coined Ranked Temporal Join (RTJ), featuring predicates that compare time intervals and a scoring function associated with each predicate to quantify how well it is satisfied. RTJ queries are prevalent in a variety of applications such as network traffic monitoring, task scheduling, and tweet analysis. RTJ queries are often best interpreted as top-k queries where only the best matches are returned. We show how to exploit the nature of temporal predicates and the properties of their associated scoring semantics to design TKIJ, an efficient query evaluation approach on a distributed Map-Reduce architecture. TKIJ relies on an offline statistics computation that, given a time partitioning into granules, computes the distribution of intervals' endpoints in each granule, and an online computation that generates query-dependent score bounds. Those statistics are used for workload assignment to reducers. This aims at reducing data replication, to limit I/O cost. Additionally, high-scoring results are distributed evenly to enable each reducer to prune unnecessary results. Our extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that TKIJ outperforms state-of-the-art competitors and provides very good performance for n-ary RTJ queries on temporal data.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Julien Pilourdault.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilourdault:Julien", "Vincent Leroy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leroy_0001:Vincent", "Sihem Amer-Yahia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amer=Yahia:Sihem"], "pages": 13}
