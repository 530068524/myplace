Garbled RAM can be seen as a RAM analogue of Yao's garbled circuit construction, except that known realizations of Garbled RAM make non-black-box use of the underlying cryptographic primitives. In this paper we remove this limitation and provide the first black-box construction of Garbled RAM with polylogarithmic overhead. Our scheme allows for garbling multiple RAM programs being executed on a persistent database and its security is based only on the existence of one-way functions. We also obtain the first secure RAM computation protocol that is both constant round and makes only black-box use of one-way functions in the Oblivious Transfer hybrid model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Sanjam Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Sanjam", "Steve Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Steve", "Rafail Ostrovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostrovsky:Rafail"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
