{"title": "Knowledge transformation from word space to document space.", "fields": ["tf idf", "matrix decomposition", "non negative matrix factorization", "document clustering", "cosine similarity"], "abstract": "In most IR clustering problems, we directly cluster the documents, working in the document space, using cosine similarity between documents as the similarity measure. In many real-world applications, however, we usually have knowledge on the word side and wish to transform this knowledge to the document (concept) side. In this paper, we provide a mechanism for this knowledge transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model for such type of knowledge transformation. This model uses a nonnegative matrix factorization model  X  =  FSG   T  , where  X  is the word document semantic matrix,  F  is the posterior probability of a word belonging to a word cluster and represents knowledge in the word space,  G  is the posterior probability of a document belonging to a document cluster and represents knowledge in the document space, and  S  is a scaled matrix factor which provides a condensed view of  X . We show how knowledge on words can improve document clustering, i.e, knowledge in the word space is transformed into the document space. We perform extensive experiments to validate our approach.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Florida International University", "University of Texas at Arlington", "Florida International University", "Florida International University"], "authors": ["Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Tao", "Chris H.
