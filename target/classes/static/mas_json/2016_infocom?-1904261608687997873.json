Most video encoding standards such as H.264 and MPEG-4 compress the temporal redundancy in a video stream using difference coding, which only encodes the residual image between a frame and its reference frame. Difference coding can efficiently compress a video stream, but it causes side-channel information leakage even though the video stream is encrypted, as reported in this paper. Particularly, we observe that the traffic patterns of an encrypted video stream are different when a user conducts different basic activities of daily living, which must be kept private from third parties as obliged by HIPAA regulations. We also observe that by exploiting this side-channel information leakage, attackers can readily infer a user's basic activities of daily living based on only the traffic size data of an encrypted video stream. We validate such an attack using two off-the-shelf cameras, and the results indicate that the user's basic activities of daily living can be recognized with a high accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Xidian University", "George Washington University", "Qufu Normal University", "Beijing Key Lab ... ing, CAS, China", "Beijing Key Lab ... ing, CAS, China"], "authors": ["Hong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0004:Hong", "Yunhua He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yunhua", "Limin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Limin", "Xiuzhen Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiuzhen", "Jiguo Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jiguo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
