{"title": "Learning time-series shapelets.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "data mining", "discriminative model", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Shapelets are discriminative sub-sequences of time series that best predict the target variable. For this reason, shapelet discovery has recently attracted considerable interest within the time-series research community. Currently shapelets are found by evaluating the prediction qualities of numerous candidates extracted from the series segments. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, this paper proposes a novel perspective in terms of learning shapelets. A new mathematical formalization of the task via a classification objective function is proposed and a tailored stochastic gradient learning algorithm is applied. The proposed method enables learning near-to-optimal shapelets directly without the need to try out lots of candidates. Furthermore, our method can learn true top-K shapelets by capturing their interaction. Extensive experimentation demonstrates statistically significant improvement in terms of wins and ranks against 13 baselines over 28 time-series datasets.", "citation": "Citations (115)", "departments": ["University of Hildesheim", "University of Hildesheim", "University of Hildesheim", "University of Hildesheim"], "authors": ["Josif Grabocka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grabocka:Josif", "Nicolas Schilling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schilling:Nicolas", "Martin Wistuba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wistuba:Martin", "Lars Schmidt-Thieme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt=Thieme:Lars"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
