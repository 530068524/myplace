The composite service operates in a highly dynamic environment; hence, it can fail at any time due to the failure of component services. Service composition languages such as BPEL provide a compensation mechanism to rollback the error. But such a compensation mechanism has several issues. For instance, it cannot guarantee the functional properties of the composite service after compensation. In this work, we propose an automated approach based on a genetic algorithm to calculate the recovery plan that could guarantee the satisfaction of functional properties of the composite service after recovery. Given a composite service with large state space, the proposed method does not require exploring the full state space of the composite service; therefore, it allows efficient selection of recovery plan. In addition, the selection of recovery plans is based on their quality of service (QoS). A QoS-optimal recovery plan allows effective recovery from the state of failure. Our approach has been evaluated on real-world case studies, and has shown promising results.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Singapore University of Technology and Design", "National University of Singapore", "University of Paris", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Tian Huat Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Tian_Huat", "Manman Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Manman", "\u00c9tienne Andr\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andr=eacute=:=Eacute=tienne", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Yang", "Jin Song Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jin_Song"], "conf": "www", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
