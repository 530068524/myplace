While these L1 trackers showed impressive tracking accuracies, they are very computationally demanding and the speed bottleneck is the solver to l 1  norm minimizations. This paper aims at developing an L1 tracker that not only runs in real time but also enjoys better robustness than other L1 trackers. In our proposed L1 tracker, a new l 1  norm related minimization model is proposed to improve the tracking accuracy by adding an l 1  norm regularization on the coefficients associated with the trivial templates. Moreover, based on the accelerated proximal gradient approach, a very fast numerical solver is developed to solve the resulting l 1  norm related minimization problem with guaranteed quadratic convergence. The great running time efficiency and tracking accuracy of the proposed tracker is validated with a comprehensive evaluation involving eight challenging sequences and five alternative state-of-the-art trackers.", "citation": "Citations (880)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Temple University", "Temple University", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chenglong Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Chenglong", "Yi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Yi", "Haibin Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Haibin", "Hui Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Hui"], "pages": 8}
