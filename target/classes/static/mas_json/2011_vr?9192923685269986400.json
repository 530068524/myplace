{"title": "Mixed reality for supporting office devices troubleshooting.", "fields": ["3d modeling", "collaboration", "mixed reality", "troubleshooting", "office automation"], "abstract": "In this paper we describe the Mixed Reality system that we are developing to facilitate a real-world application, that of collaborative remote troubleshooting of broken office devices. The architecture of the system is centered on a 3D virtual representation of the device augmented with status data of the actual device coming from its internal sensors. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how this approach supports the interactions required by the remote collaborative troubleshooting activity whilst taking into account technical constraints that come from a real world application. We believe it constitutes an interesting opportunity for using Mixed Reality in this domain.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Xerox", "Xerox", "Xerox", "Xerox", "Xerox"], "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Roulland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roulland:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Stefania Castellani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castellani:Stefania", "Pascal Valobra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valobra:Pascal", "Victor Ciriza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciriza:Victor", "Jacki O'Neill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Neill:Jacki", "Ye Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Ye"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
