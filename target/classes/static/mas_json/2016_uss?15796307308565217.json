{"title": "Trusted Browsers for Uncertain Times.", "fields": ["fork", "fermata", "software deployment", "javascript", "channel"], "abstract": "JavaScript in one origin can use timing channels in browsers to learn sensitive information about a user\u2019s interaction with other origins, violating the browser\u2019s compartmentalization guarantees. Browser vendors have attempted to close timing channels by trying to rewrite sensitive code to run in constant time and by reducing the resolution of reference clocks. We argue that these ad-hoc efforts are unlikely to succeed. We show techniques that increase the effective resolution of degraded clocks by two orders of magnitude, and we present and evaluate multiple, new implicit clocks: techniques by which JavaScript can time events without consulting an explicit clock at all. We show how \u201cfuzzy time\u201d ideas in the trusted operating systems literature can be adapted to building trusted browsers, degrading all clocks and reducing the bandwidth of all timing channels. We describe the design of a next-generation browser, called Fermata, in which all timing sources are completely mediated. As a proof of feasibility, we present Fuzzyfox, a fork of the Firefox browser that implements many of the Fermata principles within the constraints of today\u2019s browser architecture. We show that Fuzzyfox achieves sufficient compatibility and performance for deployment today by privacysensitive users.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["David Kohlbrenner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohlbrenner:David", "Hovav Shacham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shacham:Hovav"], "pages": 18}
