Specifically, we consider two node mobility models: (1) two-dimensional i.i.d. mobility, (2) one-dimensional i.i.d. mobility. Two mobility time-scales are included in this paper: (i) Fast mobility where node mobility is at the same time-scale as data transmissions; (ii) Slow mobility where node mobility is assumed to occur at a much slower time-scale than data transmissions. Given a delay constraint D, we first characterize the optimal multicast capacity for each of the four mobility models, and then we develop a scheme that can achieve a capacity-delay tradeoff close to the upper bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our study can be further extended to two-dimensional/one-dimensional hybrid random walk fast/slow mobility models and heterogeneous networks.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yun", "Xiaoyu Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Xiaoyu", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing", "Yu Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Yu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
