Stationary crowd groups are a key factor influencing pedestrian walking patterns but was largely ignored in literature. In this paper, a novel model is proposed for pedestrian behavior modeling by including stationary crowd groups as a key component. Through inference on the interactions between stationary crowd groups and pedestrians, our model can be used to investigate pedestrian behaviors. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through multiple applications, including walking path prediction, destination prediction, personality classification, and abnormal event detection. To evaluate our model, a large pedestrian walking route dataset 1 is built. The walking routes of 12, 684 pedestrians from a one-hour crowd surveillance video are manually annotated. It will be released to the public and benefit future research on pedestrian behavior analysis and crowd scene understanding.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shuai Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Shuai", "Hongsheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongsheng", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang"], "pages": 9}
