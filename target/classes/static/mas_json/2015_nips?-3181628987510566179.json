Most learning algorithms that involve optimisation of the mutual information rely on the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm \u2014 an enumerative algorithm with exponential complexity that is not suitable for modern machine learning applications. This paper provides a new approach for scalable optimisation of the mutual information by merging techniques from variational inference and deep learning. We develop our approach by focusing on the problem of intrinsically-motivated learning, where the mutual information forms the definition of a well-known internal drive known as empowerment. Using a variational lower bound on the mutual information, combined with convolutional networks for handling visual input streams, we develop a stochastic optimisation algorithm that allows for scalable information maximisation and empowerment-based reasoning directly from pixels to actions.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Google", "Google"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shakir Mohamed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohamed:Shakir", "Danilo Jimenez Rezende.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rezende:Danilo_Jimenez"], "pages": 9}
