For languages such as Chinese where words usually have meaningful internal structure and word boundaries are often fuzzy, TESLA-CELAB acknowledges the advantage of character-level evaluation over word-level evaluation. By reformulating the problem in the linear programming framework, TESLA-CELAB addresses several drawbacks of the character-level metrics, in particular the modeling of synonyms spanning multiple characters. We show empirically that TESLA-CELAB significantly outperforms character-level BLEU in the English-Chinese translation evaluation tasks.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Chang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chang", "Hwee Tou Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Hwee_Tou"], "pages": 9}
