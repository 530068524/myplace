{"title": "Integration of spatial sound in immersive virtual environments an experimental study on effects of spatial sound on presence.", "fields": ["immersion", "mixed reality", "cave automatic virtual environment", "instructional simulation", "display device"], "abstract": "Sound is an important part of an immersive virtual environment, contributing to immersion, presence, and user performance. The experimental study presented analyzed the effect of spatial-sound vs. no-sound display on presence experienced in a 3D virtual scene. Results indicate a medium to strong effect of spatial sound, leading to higher levels of presence experienced.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Res.
