{"title": "Generative Structure Learning for Markov Logic Networks Based on Graph of Predicates.", "fields": ["markov chain", "graph", "predicate", "generative grammar", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "In this paper we present a new algorithm for generatively learning the structure of Markov Logic Networks. This algorithm relies on a graph of predicates, which summarizes the links existing between predicates and on relational information between ground atoms in the training database. Candidate clauses are produced by means of a heuristical variabilization technique. According to our first experiments, this approach appears to be promising.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Orl\u00e9ans", "University of Orl\u00e9ans", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Quang-Thang Dinh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinh:Quang=Thang", "Matthieu Exbrayat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Exbrayat:Matthieu", "Christel Vrain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vrain:Christel"], "pages": 6}
