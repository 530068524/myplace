{"title": "Lightning Does Not Strike Twice: Robust MDPs with Coupled Uncertainty.", "fields": ["restrict", "bounded function", "probabilistic logic", "markov decision process", "lightning"], "abstract": "We consider Markov decision processes under parameter uncertainty. Previous studies all restrict to the case that uncertainties among different states are uncoupled, which leads to conservative solutions. In contrast, we introduce an intuitive concept, termed \"Lightning Does not Strike Twice,\" to model coupled uncertain parameters. Specifically, we require that the system can deviate from its nominal parameters only a bounded number of times. We give probabilistic guarantees indicating that this model represents real life situations and devise tractable algorithms for computing optimal control policies.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie", "Ofir Mebel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mebel:Ofir", "Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
