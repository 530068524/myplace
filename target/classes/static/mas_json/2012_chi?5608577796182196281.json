We present  Rock-Paper-Fibers , a device that is functionally equivalent to a touchpad, yet that users can reshape so as to best match the interaction at hand. For efficiency, users interact bimanually: one hand reshapes the device and the other hand operates the resulting widget.   We present a prototype that achieves deformability using a bundle of optical fibers, demonstrate an audio player and a simple video game each featuring multiple widgets. We demonstrate how to support applications that require responsiveness by adding mechanical  wedges  and  clamps .", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "authors": ["Frederik Rudeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudeck:Frederik", "Patrick Baudisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baudisch:Patrick"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
