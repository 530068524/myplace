Participating analysts in the study carry out two scenarios where they organize and triage information, conduct intelligence analysis, report results, and collaborate with one another. Through a combination of scenario-based analysis, artifact analysis, role-playing, interviews, and participant observations, we explore the space and boundaries in which intelligence analysts work and operate. We also assess the implications of our findings on the use and application of key information technologies.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"], "authors": ["George Chin Jr......http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chin_Jr=:George", "Olga A.
