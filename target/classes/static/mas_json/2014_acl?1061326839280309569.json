In this paper, we investigate the problem of character-level Chinese dependency parsing, building dependency trees over characters. Character-level information can benefit downstream applications by offering flexible granularities for word segmentation while improving wordlevel dependency parsing accuracies. We present novel adaptations of two major shift-reduce dependency parsing algorithms to character-level parsing. Experimental results on the Chinese Treebank demonstrate improved performances over word-based parsing methods.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Meishan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Meishan", "Yue Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yue", "Wanxiang Che.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Che:Wanxiang", "Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ting"], "pages": 11}
