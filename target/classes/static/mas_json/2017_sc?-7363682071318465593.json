Among reconstruction methods, Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) is known to produce much higher quality CT images; however, the high computational requirements of MBIR greatly restrict their application. Currently, MBIR speed is primarily limited by irregular data access patterns, the difficulty of effective parallelization, and slow algorithmic convergence.   This paper presents a new algorithm for MBIR, the  Non-Uniform Parallel Super-Voxel  (NU-PSV) algorithm, that regularizes the data access pattern, enables massive parallelism, and ensures fast convergence. We compare the NU-PSV algorithm with two state-of-the-art implementations on a 69632-core distributed system. Results indicate that the NU-PSV algorithm has an average speedup of 1665 compared to the fastest state-of-the-art implementations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Microsoft", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "High Performance Imaging LLC"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Xiao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0004:Xiao", "Amit Sabne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabne:Amit", "Putt Sakdhnagool.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakdhnagool:Putt", "Sherman J.
