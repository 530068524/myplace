Quantifying the causal effect of peer inuence presents technical challenges, however, including how to deal with social interference, complex response functions and network uncertainty. In this paper, we extend potential outcomes to allow for interference, we introduce well-defined causal estimands of peer-inuence, and we develop two estimation procedures: a frequentist procedure relying on a sequential randomization design that requires knowledge of the network but operates under complicated response functions, and a Bayesian procedure which accounts for network uncertainty but relies on a linear response assumption to increase estimation precision. Our results show the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methods in a number of situations.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Panos Toulis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toulis:Panos", "Edward K.
