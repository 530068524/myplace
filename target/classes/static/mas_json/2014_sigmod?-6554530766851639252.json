A previously proposed exhaustive MOQO algorithm needs hours to optimize even simple TPC-H queries. This is why we propose several approximation schemes for MOQO that generate guaranteed near-optimal plans in seconds where exhaustive optimization takes hours. We integrated all MOQO algorithms into the Postgres optimizer and present experimental results for TPC-H queries; we extended the Postgres cost model and optimize for up to nine conflicting objectives in our experiments. The proposed algorithms are based on a formal analysis of typical cost functions that occur in the context of MOQO. We identify properties that hold for a broad range of objectives and can be exploited for the design of future MOQO algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Immanuel Trummer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trummer:Immanuel", "Christoph Koch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koch_0001:Christoph"], "pages": 12}
