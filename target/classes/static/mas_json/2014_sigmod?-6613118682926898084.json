To indicate her preferences, the user typically determines a numeric weight for each data dimension (i.e., attribute). We refer to these weights collectively as the  query vector . Based on this vector, each data record is implicitly mapped to a score value (via a weighted sum function). The records with the k largest scores are reported as the result. In this paper we propose an auxiliary feature to standard top-k query processing. Specifically, we compute the maximal locus within which the query vector incurs no change in the current top-k result. In other words, we compute all possible query weight settings that produce exactly the same top-k result as the user's original query. We call this locus the  global immutable region  (GIR). The GIR can be used as a guide to query vector readjustments, as a sensitivity measure for the top-k result, as well as to enable effective result caching. We develop efficient algorithms for GIR computation, and verify their robustness using a variety of real and synthetic datasets.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jilian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jilian", "Kyriakos Mouratidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mouratidis:Kyriakos", "HweeHwa Pang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pang:HweeHwa"], "pages": 12}
