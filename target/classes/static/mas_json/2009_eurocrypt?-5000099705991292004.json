This class contains all public-key encryption schemes where the encryption algorithm first applies some invertible public transformation to the message (the \"padding\"), followed by a trapdoor permutation. In particular, this class contains OAEP and its variants.\n\nOur main result is a black-box impossibility result showing that one cannot prove any such padding-based scheme chosen-ciphertext secure even assuming the existence of ideal trapdoor permutations. The latter is a strong ideal abstraction of trapdoor permutations which inherits all security properties of uniform random permutations.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Cryptology & In ... he Netherlands", "Cryptology & In ... he Netherlands"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Eike Kiltz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiltz:Eike", "Krzysztof Pietrzak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietrzak:Krzysztof"], "pages": 18}
