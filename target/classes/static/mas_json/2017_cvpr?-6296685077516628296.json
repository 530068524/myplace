An examination of the popular binary quantization approach shows that this consists of approximating a classical non-linearity, the hyperbolic tangent, by two functions: a piecewise constant sign function, which is used in feedforward network computations, and a piecewise linear hard tanh function, used in the backpropagation step during network learning. The problem of approximating the widely used ReLU non-linearity is then considered. An half-wave Gaussian quantizer (HWGQ) is proposed for forward approximation and shown to have efficient implementation, by exploiting the statistics of of network activations and batch normalization operations. To overcome the problem of gradient mismatch, due to the use of different forward and backward approximations, several piece-wise backward approximators are then investigated. The implementation of the resulting quantized network, denoted as HWGQ-Net, is shown to achieve much closer performance to full precision networks, such as AlexNet, ResNet, GoogLeNet and VGG-Net, than previously available low-precision networks, with 1-bit binary weights and 2-bit quantized activations.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Microsoft", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhaowei Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Zhaowei", "Xiaodong He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaodong", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jian", "Nuno Vasconcelos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasconcelos:Nuno"], "pages": 9}
