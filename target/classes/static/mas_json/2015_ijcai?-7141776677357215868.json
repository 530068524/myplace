{"title": "Modeling Inter- and Intra-Part Deformations for Object Structure Parsing.", "fields": ["parsing", "inference", "belief propagation", "neural coding", "matching pursuit"], "abstract": "Part deformation has been a longstanding challenge for object parsing, of which the primary difficulty lies in modeling the highly diverse object structures. To this end, we propose a novel structure parsing model to capture deformable object structures. The proposed model consists of two deformable layers: the top layer is an undirected graph that incorporates inter-part deformations to infer object structures; the base layer is consisted of various independent nodes to characterize local intra-part deformations. To learn this two-layer model, we design a layer-wise learning algorithm, which employs matching pursuit and belief propagation for a low computational complexity inference. Specifically, active basis sparse coding is leveraged to build the nodes at the base layer, while the edge weights are estimated by a structural support vector machine. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets (i.e., faces and horses) demonstrate that the proposed model yields superior parsing performance over state-of-the-art models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Xiamen University", "Xiamen University", "IBM", "Stevens Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ling Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Ling", "Rongrong Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Rongrong", "Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Wei", "Gang Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Gang"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
