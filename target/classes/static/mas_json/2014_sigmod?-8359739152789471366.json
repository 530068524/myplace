Current spatial clustering models disregard information about the people who are related to the clustered places. In this paper, we show how the density-based clustering paradigm can be extended to apply on places which are visited by users of a geo-social network. Our model considers both spatial information and the social relationships between users who visit the clustered places. After formally defining the model and the distance measure it relies on, we present efficient algorithms for its implementation, based on spatial indexing. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model via a case study on real data; in addition, we design two quantitative measures, called social entropy and community score to evaluate the quality of the discovered clusters. The results show that geo-social clusters have special properties and cannot be found by applying simple spatial clustering approaches. The efficiency of our index-based implementation is also evaluated experimentally.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jieming Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jieming", "Nikos Mamoulis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mamoulis:Nikos", "Dingming Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Dingming", "David W.
