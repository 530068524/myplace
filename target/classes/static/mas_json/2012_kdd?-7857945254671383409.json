{"title": "D-INDEX: a web environment for analyzing dependences among scientific collaborators.", "fields": ["curriculum", "collaboration graph", "chart", "scientometrics", "web application"], "abstract": "In this work, we demonstrate a web application, available at  http://d-index.di.unito.it , that permits to analyze the scientific profiles of all the researchers indexed by DBLP by focusing on the collaborations that contributed to define their curricula. The presented application allows the user to analyze the profile of a researcher, her dependence degrees on all the co-authors (along her entire scientific publication history) and to make comparisons among them in terms of dependence patterns. In particular, it is possible to estimate and visualize how much a researcher has benefited from collaboration with another researcher as well as the communities in which she has been involved. Moreover, the application permits to compare, in a single chart, each researcher with all the scientists indexed in DBLP by focusing on their dependences with respect to many other parameters like the total number of papers, the number of collaborations and the length of the scientific careers.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Turin", "University of Turin", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris"], "authors": ["Claudio Schifanella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schifanella:Claudio", "Luigi Di Caro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caro:Luigi_Di", "Mario Cataldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cataldi:Mario", "Marie-Aude Aufaure.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aufaure:Marie=Aude"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
