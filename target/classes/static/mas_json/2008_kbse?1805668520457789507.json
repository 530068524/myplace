However, existing management approaches for code clone group evolution are still ad hoc, unsatisfactory, and limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for comprehensive code clone group management in evolving software. The core of our method is Cleman, an algorithmic framework that allows for a systematic construction of efficient and accurate clone group management tools. Clone group management is rigorously formulated by a formal model, which provides the foundation for Cleman framework. We use Cleman framework to build a clone group management tool that is able to detect high-quality clone groups and efficiently manage them when the software evolves. We also conduct an empirical evaluation on real-world systems to show the flexibility of Cleman framework and the efficiency, completeness, and incremental updatability of our tool.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Tung Thanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Tung_Thanh", "Hoan Anh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hoan_Anh", "Nam H.
