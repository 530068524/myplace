{"title": "Indistinguishability Obfuscation and UCEs: The Case of Computationally Unpredictable Sources.", "fields": ["random oracle", "deterministic encryption", "obfuscation", "eprint", "cryptosystem"], "abstract": "Random oracles are powerful cryptographic objects. They facilitate the security proofs of an impressive number of practical cryptosystems ranging from KDM-secure and deterministic encryption to point-function obfuscation and many more. However, due to an uninstantiability result of Canetti, Goldreich, and Halevi (STOC 1998) random oracles have become somewhat controversial. Recently, Bellare, Hoang, and Keelveedhi (BHK; CRYPTO 2013 and ePrint 2013/424, August 2013) introduced a new abstraction called Universal Computational Extractors (UCEs), and showed that they suffice to securely replace random oracles in a number of prominent applications, including all those mentioned above, without suffering from the aforementioned uninstantiability result. This, however, leaves open the question of constructing UCEs in the standard model.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Royal Holloway, University of London", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Christina Brzuska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brzuska:Christina", "Pooya Farshim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farshim:Pooya", "Arno Mittelbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mittelbach:Arno"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2014", "pages": 18}
