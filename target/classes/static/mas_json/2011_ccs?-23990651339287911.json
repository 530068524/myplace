{"title": "Process out-grafting: an efficient \"out-of-VM\" approach for fine-grained process execution monitoring.", "fields": ["virtual machine", "virtual machine introspection", "semantic gap", "virtualization", "malware"], "abstract": "Recent rapid malware growth has exposed the limitations of traditional in-host malware-defense systems and motivated the development of secure virtualization-based out-of-VM solutions. By running vulnerable systems as virtual machines (VMs) and moving security software from inside the VMs to outside, the out-of-VM solutions securely isolate the anti-malware software from the vulnerable system. However, the presence of semantic gap also leads to the compatibility problem in not supporting existing defense software. In this paper, we present process out-grafting, an architectural approach to address both isolation and compatibility challenges in out-of-VM approaches for fine-grained process-level execution monitoring. Specifically, by relocating a suspect process from inside a VM to run side-by-side with the out-of-VM security tool, our technique effectively removes the semantic gap and supports existing user-mode process monitoring tools without any modification. Moreover, by forwarding the system calls back to the VM, we can smoothly continue the execution of the out-grafted process without weakening the isolation of the monitoring tool. We have developed a KVM-based prototype and used it to natively support a number of existing tools without any modification. The evaluation results including measurement with benchmark programs show it is effective and practical with a small performance overhead.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Deepa Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Deepa", "Zhi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0004:Zhi", "Xuxian Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Xuxian", "Dongyan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Dongyan"], "pages": 12}
