The method is designed for events representing the scenes visual contrast as a sparse visual code allowing the stereo reconstruction of high resolution panoramic views. We propose a novel cost measure for the stereo matching, which makes use of a similarity measure based on event distributions. Thus, the robustness to variations in event occurrences was increased. An evaluation of the proposed stereo method is presented using distance estimation of panoramic stereo views and ground truth data. Furthermore, our approach is compared to standard stereo methods applied on event-data. Results show that we obtain 3D reconstructions of 1024 \u00d7 3600 round views and outperform depth reconstruction accuracy of state-of-the-art methods on event data.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Austrian Institute of Technology", "Austrian Institute of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Stephan Schraml.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schraml:Stephan", "Ahmed Nabil Belbachir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belbachir:Ahmed_Nabil", "Horst Bischof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischof:Horst"], "pages": 9}
