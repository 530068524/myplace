It is also used in recent AE proposals within the CAESAR competition which aim at providing nonce misuse resistance, such as POET. The algebraic structure of polynomial hashing has given rise to security concerns: At CRYPTO 2008, Handschuh and Preneel describe key recovery attacks, and at FSE 2013, Procter and Cid provide a comprehensive framework for forgery attacks. Both approaches rely heavily on the ability to construct forgery polynomials having disjoint sets of roots, with many roots (\u201cweak keys\u201d) each. Constructing such polynomials beyond naive approaches is crucial for these attacks, but still an open problem.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Technical University of Denmark", "Technical University of Denmark", "Technical University of Denmark", "Technical University of Denmark"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Mohamed Ahmed Abdelraheem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdelraheem:Mohamed_Ahmed", "Peter Beelen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beelen:Peter", "Andrey Bogdanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogdanov:Andrey", "Elmar Tischhauser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tischhauser:Elmar"], "pages": 25}
