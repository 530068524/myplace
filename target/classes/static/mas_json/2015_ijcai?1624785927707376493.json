{"title": "An Efficient Classifier Based on Hierarchical Mixing Linear Support Vector Machines.", "fields": ["margin classifier", "overfitting", "linear classifier", "quadratic classifier", "data classification"], "abstract": "Support vector machines (SVMs) play a very dominant role in data classification due to their good generalization performance. However, they suffer from the high computational complexity in the classification phase when there are a considerable number of support vectors (SVs). Then it is desirable to design efficient algorithms in the classification phase to deal with the datasets of real-time pattern recognition systems. To this end, we propose a novel classifier called HMLSVMs (Hierarchical Mixing Linear Support Vector Machines) in this paper, which has a hierarchical structure with a mixing linear SVMs classifier at each node and predicts the label of a sample using only a few hyperplanes. We also give a generalization error bound for the class of locally linear SVMs (LLSVMs) based on the Rademacher theory, which ensures that overfitting can be effectively avoided. Experimental evaluations shows, while maintaining a comparable classification performance to kernel SVMs (KSVMs), the proposed classifier achieves the high efficiency in the classification stage.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Wenzhou University", "Wenzhou University", "Wenzhou University", "Wenzhou University"], "authors": ["Di Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Di", "Xiaoqin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiaoqin", "Mingyu Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Mingyu", "Xiuzi Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Xiuzi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
