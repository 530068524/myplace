However, even with continuous innovation and evolution of the protocol, its adoption on forwarding device targets remains laborious and time consuming. In this paper, we present a semantic-based approach to packet forwarding design that tailors flow classification to the underlying switch device. Its key idea consist in streamlining flow classification through rule compiling and thus to optimize forwarding operations and improve switch resources usage. The compiling itself exploits a rule grouping gleaned through Frequent Pattern Mining and Network Calculus in optimizing flow classification w.r.t. the switch pipelined architecture.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec", "Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec", "Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec", "Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec", "University of Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Salaheddine Hamadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamadi:Salaheddine", "Khalil Blaiech.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blaiech:Khalil", "Petko Valtchev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valtchev:Petko", "Omar Cherkaoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cherkaoui:Omar", "Radu State.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/State:Radu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
