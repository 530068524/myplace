In this paper, we therefore study the complexity of computing approximate equilibria in congestion games. An alpha-approximate equilibrium, for \u03b1 > 1, is a state of the game in which none of the players can make an \u03b1-greedy step, i.e., an unilateral strategy change that decreases the player's cost by a factor of at least \u03b1. Our main result shows that finding an \u03b1-approximate equilibrium of a given congestion game is sc PLS-complete, for any polynomial-time computable \u03b1 > 1. Our analysis is based on a gap introducing PLS-reduction from FLIP, i.e., the problem of finding a local optimum of a function encoded by an arbitrary circuit. As this reduction is tight it additionally implies that computing an \u03b1-approximate equilibrium reachable from a given initial state by a sequence of \u03b1-greedy steps is PSPACE-complete. Our results are in sharp contrast to a recent result showing that every local search problem in PLS admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme.   In addition, we show that there exist congestion games with states such that any sequence of \u03b1-greedy steps leading from one of these states to an \u03b1-approximate Nash equilibrium has exponential length, even if the delay functions satisfy a bounded-jump condition. This result shows that a recent result about polynomial time convergence for \u03b1-greedy steps in congestion games satisfying the bounded-jump condition is restricted to symmetric games only.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Alexander Skopalik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skopalik:Alexander", "Berthold V\u00f6cking.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/V=ouml=cking:Berthold"], "pages": 10}
