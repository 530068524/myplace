{"title": "Optimal Delete-Relaxed (and Semi-Relaxed) Planning with Conditional Effects.", "fields": ["upper and lower bounds", "machine learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "solver"], "abstract": "Recently, several methods have been proposed for optimal delete-free planning. We present an incremental compilation approach that enables these methods to be applied to problems with conditional effects, which none of them support natively. With an h+ solver for problems with conditional effects in hand, we also consider adapting the h++ anytime lower bound function to use the more space-efficient PceC compilation. This avoids the memory limitation of the original h++ caused by its reliance on an exponential-space compilation. It also leads to improvements on some problems where memory is not an issue.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Australian National University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Patrik Haslum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haslum:Patrik"], "pages": 7}
