{"title": "Designing for Targeted Responder Models: Exploring Barriers to Respond.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "human computer interaction", "focus group", "mobile device", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "Targeted responder model is a recent approach in providing initial treatment to cardiac arrest patients. In this model, a group of trained responders are dispatched via mobile devices to nearby cardiac arrests. While prior work shows that targeted responder programs are successful in reducing average response time, less than a quarter of the responders who receive the notification of a nearby cardiac arrest travel to the scene of event. This study is an attempt to better understand barriers to respond in targeted responder programs. We conducted a weeklong diary study and focus groups with 12 participants. We identified four categories of barriers that emerge and we discussed the design implications of our findings within the broader context of location-based crowdsourcing.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Philips", "Philips", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Kerem \u00d6zcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ouml=zcan:Kerem", "Dawn Jorgenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jorgenson:Dawn", "Christian Richard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Richard:Christian", "Gary Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Gary"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
