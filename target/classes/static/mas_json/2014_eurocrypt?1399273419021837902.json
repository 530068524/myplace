The approach is based on card shuffling. The basic idea is to use the sometimes-recurse transformation: lightly shuffle the deck (with some other shuffle), cut the deck, and then recursively shuffle one of the two halves. Our work builds on a recent paper of Ristenpart and Yilek.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Ben Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Ben", "Phillip Rogaway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogaway:Phillip"], "pages": 16}
