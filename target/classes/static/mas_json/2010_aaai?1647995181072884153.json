The user examines the output of the model, visualized as the vertical axis of a 2D scatterplot, and provides corrections by repositioning individual data instances to the correct output level. Each repositioned data instance acts as a control point for altering the learned model, using the geometry underlying the data. We capture the underlying structure of the data as a manifold, on which we compute a set of basis functions as the foundation for learning. Our results show that manifold-based interactive learning improves performance monotonically with each correction, outperforming alternative approaches.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories", "Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories", "Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories"], "authors": ["Eric Eaton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eaton:Eric", "Gary Holness.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holness:Gary", "Daniel McFarlane.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McFarlane:Daniel"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
