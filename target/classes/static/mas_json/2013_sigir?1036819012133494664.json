One important reason for unsuccessful singing performance is because the singer fails to choose a suitable song. In this paper, we propose a novel singing competence-based song recommendation framework. It is distinguished from most existing music recommendation systems which rely on the computation of listeners' interests or similarity. We model a singer's vocal competence as singer profile, which takes voice pitch, intensity, and quality into consideration. Then we propose techniques to acquire singer profiles. We also present a song profile model which is used to construct a human annotated song database. Finally, we propose a learning-to-rank scheme for recommending songs by singer profile. The experimental study on real singers demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over two baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study competence-based song recommendation.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Lidan Shou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shou:Lidan", "Kuang Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Kuang", "Xinyuan Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Xinyuan", "Ke Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0005:Ke", "Gang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Gang", "Tianlei Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Tianlei"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
