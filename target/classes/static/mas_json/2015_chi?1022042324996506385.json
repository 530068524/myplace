{"title": "uCap: An Internet Data Management Tool For The Home.", "fields": ["download", "service provider", "internet transit", "data management", "bandwidth cap"], "abstract": "Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have introduced \"data caps\", or quotas on the amount of data that a customer can download during a billing cycle. Under this model, Internet users who reach a data cap can be subject to degraded performance, extra fees, or even temporary interruption of Internet service. For this reason, users need better visibility into and control over their Internet usage to help them understand what uses up data and control how these quotas are reached. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a tool, called uCap, to help home users manage Internet data. We conducted a field trial of uCap in 21 home networks in three countries and performed an in-depth qualitative study of ten of these homes. We present the results of the evaluation and implications for the design of future Internet data management tools.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Princeton University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Marshini Chetty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chetty:Marshini", "Hyojoon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyojoon", "Srikanth Sundaresan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundaresan:Srikanth", "Sam Burnett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burnett:Sam", "Nick Feamster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feamster:Nick", "W.
