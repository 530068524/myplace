It is shown that this abstraction is strictly more powerful than previously-proposed ones, from the perspective of more accurately representing the inherent parallelism of the provided computing capabilities. Sufficient tests are derived for determining whether a given real-time task system, represented as a collection of sporadic tasks, is guaranteed to always meet all deadlines when scheduled upon a specified virtual platform using the global EDF scheduling algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies", "Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Enrico Bini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bini:Enrico", "Marko Bertogna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertogna:Marko", "Sanjoy K.
