One instantiation gives the first such extractor to achieve an output length \u0398(K-b), where K is the source's entropy and b the adversary's storage, together with a poly-logarithmic seed length. Another instantiation achieves a logarithmic key length, with a slightly smaller output length \u0398((K-b)/K \u03b3 ) for any \u03b3>0. In contrast, the previous best construction [21] could only extract (K/b) 1/15  bits.   Some of our constructions have the additional advantage that every bit of the output is a function of only a polylogarithmic number of bits from the source, which is crucial for some cryptographic applications.   Our argument is based on bounds for a generalization of quantum random access codes, which we call  quantum functional access codes . This is crucial as it lets us avoid the local list-decoding algorithm central to the approach in [21], which was the source of the multiplicative overhead.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anindya De.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/De:Anindya", "Thomas Vidick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidick:Thomas"], "pages": 10}
