{"title": "Fast Max-Margin Matrix Factorization with Data Augmentation.", "fields": ["data set", "gibbs sampling", "matrix decomposition", "nonparametric statistics", "probabilistic logic"], "abstract": "Existing max-margin matrix factorization (M3F) methods either are computationally inefficient or need a model selection procedure to determine the number of latent factors. In this paper we present a probabilistic M3F model that admits a highly efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm through data augmentation. We further extend our approach to incorporate Bayesian nonparametrics and build accordingly a truncation-free nonparametric M3F model where the number of latent factors is literally unbounded and inferred from data. Empirical studies on two large real-world data sets verify the efficacy of our proposed methods.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Minjie Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Minjie", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Bo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0010:Bo"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
