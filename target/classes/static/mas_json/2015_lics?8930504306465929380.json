We propose a novel approach in which a strategy is not a set, but a tree, of plays, and develop a fully abstract game model for a nondeterministic stateless language. Mathematically such a strategy is formalised as a sheaf over an appropriate site of plays. We conclude with a study on the difficulties pointed out by Harmer and McCusker in terms of the structure of the coverage of the sites.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Takeshi Tsukada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsukada:Takeshi", "C.-H.
