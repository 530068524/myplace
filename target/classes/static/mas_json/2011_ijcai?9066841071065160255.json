In this paper, we propose a recommender system for clothing coordinates using full-body photographs from fashion magazines. The task is that, given a photograph of a fashion item (e.g. tops) as a query, to recommend a photograph of other fashion items (e.g. bottoms) that is appropriate to the query. With the proposed method, we use a probabilistic topic model for learning information about coordinates from visual features in each fashion item region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using real photographs from a fashion magazine and two fashion style sharing services with the task of making top (bottom) recommendations given bottom (top) photographs.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Tomoharu Iwata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwata:Tomoharu", "Shinji Wanatabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wanatabe:Shinji", "Hiroshi Sawada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sawada:Hiroshi"], "pages": 6}
