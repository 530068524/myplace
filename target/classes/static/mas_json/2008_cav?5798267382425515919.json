Our aim is to construct an algorithm that allows us to check both bounded and unbounded properties using standard bit-level model checking methods as back-end decision procedures, while incurring minimum runtime penalties for designs that are unsuited to our analysis. We do this by combining modifications of several previously known techniques into a static abstraction algorithm which is guaranteed to produce bit-level netlists that are as small or smaller than the original bitblasted designs. We evaluate our algorithm on several challenging hardware components.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Synopsys"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Per Bjesse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bjesse:Per"], "pages": 13}
