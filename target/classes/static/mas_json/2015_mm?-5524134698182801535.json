The system consists of a Django project and an AngularJS web application. It allows to easily create emotional video datasets, process the videos, extract the features and model the emotion. All data is exposed by a REST API, making it available not only to the eRS web application, but also to other applications. All visualizations are interactive and linked to the playing video, allowing researchers to easily analyze the results of their algorithms. The system currently runs on Linux and OS X. eRS can be extended, to integrate new features and algorithms needed in the different steps of emotion recognition in movies.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["HumanTech Insti ... rg, Switzerland", "HumanTech Insti ... rg, Switzerland", "HumanTech Insti ... rg, Switzerland", "HumanTech Insti ... rg, Switzerland"], "authors": ["Jo\u00ebl Dumoulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dumoulin:Jo=euml=l", "Diana Affi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Affi:Diana", "Elena Mugellini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mugellini:Elena", "Omar Abou Khaled.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khaled:Omar_Abou"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
