Decidability of HOM is an important theoretical question which was open for a long time. Recently, HOM has been proved decidable with a triple exponential time algorithm. In this paper we obtain an exponential time algorithm for this problem, and conclude that it is EXPTIME-complete. The proof builds upon previous results and techniques on tree automata with constraints.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dept. de Llengu ... arcelona, Spain", "Dept. de Llengu ... arcelona, Spain", "Dept. de Llengu ... arcelona, Spain", "Dept. de Llengu ... arcelona, Spain"], "authors": ["Carles Creus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Creus:Carles", "Adri\u00e0 Gasc\u00f3n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gasc=oacute=n:Adri=agrave=", "Guillem Godoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Godoy:Guillem", "Lander Ramos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramos:Lander"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
