Time utility functions provide a necessarily richer description of timing semantics, but designing utility-aware scheduling policies using them is an open research problem. In particular, scheduling design that optimizes expected utility accrual is needed for real-time cyber-physical domains. In this paper we design scheduling policies that optimize expected utility accrual for cyber-physical systems with periodic, non-preemptable tasks that run with stochastic duration. These policies are derived by solving a Markov Decision Process formulation of the scheduling problem. We use this formulation to demonstrate that our technique improves on existing heuristic utility accrual scheduling policies.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Terry Tidwell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tidwell:Terry", "Robert Glaubius.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glaubius:Robert", "Christopher D.
