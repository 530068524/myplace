In this paper, we propose the Bayesian Browsing Model (BBM), a new modeling technique with following advantages: (a) it does exact inference; (b) it is single-pass and parallelizable; (c) it is effective.   We present two sets of experiments to test model effectiveness and efficiency. On the first set of over 50 million search instances of 1.1 million distinct queries, BBM out-performs the state-of-the-art competitor by 29.2% in log-likelihood while being 57 times faster. On the second click-log set, spanning a quarter of petabyte data, we showcase the scalability of BBM: we implemented it on a commercial MapReduce cluster, and it took only 3 hours to compute the relevance for 1.15 billion distinct query-URL pairs.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Chao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Chao", "Fan Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Fan", "Christos Faloutsos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faloutsos:Christos"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
