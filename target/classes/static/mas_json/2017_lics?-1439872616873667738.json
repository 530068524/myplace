Its defining principle is that universally and existentially quantified variables may not occur together in atoms. The known upper bound on the time required to decide SF's satisfiability problem is formulated in terms of quantifier alternations: Given an SF sentence \u2203z\u20d7\u2200x\u20d7 1 \u2203y\u20d7 1 \u2026\u2200x\u20d7 n \u2203y\u20d7 n .\u03c8 in which \u03c8 is quantifier free, satisfiability can be decided in non-deterministic n-fold exponential time. In the present paper, we conduct a more fine-grained analysis of the complexity of SF-satisfiability. We derive an upper and a lower bound in terms of the degree \u2202 of interaction of existential variables (short: degree)\u2014a novel measure of how many separate existential quantifier blocks in a sentence are connected via joint occurrences of variables in atoms. Our main result is the k-NEXPTIME-completeness of the satisfiability problem for the set SF \u2202\u2264k  of all SF sentences that have degree k or smaller. Consequently, we show that SF-satisfiability is non-elementary in general, since SF is defined without restrictions on the degree. Beyond trivial lower bounds, nothing has been known about the hardness of SF-satisfiability so far.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Marco Voigt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voigt:Marco"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
