However, this mutability also leads many to distrust it as a reliable source of information. Although there have been many attempts at developing metrics to help users judge the trustworthiness of content, it is unknown how much impact such measures can have on a system that is perceived as inherently unstable. Here we examine whether a visualization that exposes hidden article information can impact readers' perceptions of trustworthiness in a wiki environment. Our results suggest that surfacing information relevant to the stability of the article and the patterns of editor behavior can have a significant impact on users' trust across a variety of page types.", "citation": "Citations (118)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "PARC", "PARC"], "authors": ["Aniket Kittur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kittur:Aniket", "Bongwon Suh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suh:Bongwon", "Ed H.
