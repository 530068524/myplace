Yet it is now that advances in digital fabrication, actuated tangible interfaces, and shape-changing displays are spurring an emerging area of research that we call Data Physicalization. It aims to help people explore, understand, and communicate data using computer-supported physical data representations. We call these representations physicalizations, analogously to visualizations -- their purely visual counterpart. In this article, we go beyond the focused research questions addressed so far by delineating the research area, synthesizing its open challenges and laying out a research agenda.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yvonne Jansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jansen:Yvonne", "Pierre Dragicevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dragicevic:Pierre", "Petra Isenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isenberg:Petra", "Jason Alexander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alexander:Jason", "Abhijit Karnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karnik:Abhijit", "Johan Kildal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kildal:Johan", "Sriram Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Sriram", "Kasper Hornb\u00e6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hornb=aelig=k:Kasper"], "pages": 10}
