(Crypto 2011) proved that unconditional UC-secure computation is possible if parties have access to honestly generated physically unclonable functions (PUFs). Dachman-Soled et. al. (Crypto 2014) then showed how to obtain unconditional UC secure computation based on malicious PUFs, assuming such PUFs are stateless. They also showed that unconditional oblivious transfer is impossible against an adversary that creates malicious stateful PUFs.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Salerno"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Saikrishna Badrinarayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badrinarayanan:Saikrishna", "Dakshita Khurana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khurana:Dakshita", "Rafail Ostrovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostrovsky:Rafail", "Ivan Visconti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Visconti:Ivan"], "pages": 30}
