To shed light on Internet-wide spam avoidance, we study the domain-level graph from a 6.3B-page web crawl and compare several agnostic topology-based ranking algorithms on this dataset. We first propose a new methodology for comparing the various rankings and then show that in-degree BFS-based techniques decisively outperform classic PageRank-style methods. However, since BFS requires several orders of magnitude higher overhead and is generally infeasible for real-time use, we propose a fast, accurate, and scalable estimation method that can achieve much better crawl prioritization in practice, especially in applications with limited hardware resources.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Microsoft", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Clint Sparkman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sparkman:Clint", "Hsin-Tsang Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hsin=Tsang", "Dmitri Loguinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loguinov:Dmitri"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
