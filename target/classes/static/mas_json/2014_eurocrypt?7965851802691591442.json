{"title": "GGHLite: More Efficient Multilinear Maps from Ideal Lattices.", "fields": ["random oracle", "statistical distance", "security parameter", "combinatorics", "lattice", "exponential function", "mathematics", "multilinear map"], "abstract": "The GGH Graded Encoding Scheme[9], based on ideal lattices, is the first plausible approximation to a cryptographic multilinear map. Unfortunately, using the security analysis in[9], the scheme requires very large parameters to provide security for its underlying \u201cencoding re-randomization\u201d process. Our main contributions are to formalize, simplify and improve the efficiency and the security analysis of the re-randomization process in the GGH construction. This results in a new construction that we call GGHLite. In particular, we first lower the size of a standard deviation parameter of the re-randomization process of[9] from exponential to polynomial in the security parameter. This first improvement is obtained via a finer security analysis of the \u201cdrowning\u201d step of re-randomization, in which we apply the Renyi divergence instead of the conventional statistical distance as a measure of distance between distributions. Our second improvement is to reduce the number of randomizers needed from \u03a9(n logn) to 2, where n is the dimension of the underlying ideal lattices. These two contributions allow us to decrease the bit size of the public parameters from O(\u03bb 5 log\u03bb) for the GGH scheme to O(\u03bblog2 \u03bb) in GGHLite, with respect to the security parameter \u03bb (for a constant multilinearity parameter \u03ba).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "Monash University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Adeline Langlois.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langlois:Adeline", "Damien Stehl\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stehl=eacute=:Damien", "Ron Steinfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinfeld:Ron"], "pages": 18}
