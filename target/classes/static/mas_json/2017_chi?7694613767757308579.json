{"title": "\"People Are Either Too Fake or Too Real\": Opportunities and Challenges in Tie-Based Anonymity.", "fields": ["anonymity", "internet privacy", "self disclosure", "negativity effect", "social media"], "abstract": "In recent years, several mobile applications allowed individuals to anonymously share information with friends and contacts, without any persistent identity marker. The functions of these \"tie-based\" anonymity services may be notably different than other social media services. We use semi-structured interviews to qualitatively examine motivations, practices and perceptions in two tie-based anonymity apps: Secret (now defunct, in the US) and Mimi (in China). Among the findings, we show that: (1) while users are more comfortable in self-disclosure, they still have specific practices and strategies to avoid or allow identification; (2) attempts for deidentification of others are prevalent and often elaborate; and (3) participants come to expect both negativity and support in response to posts. Our findings highlight unique opportunities and potential benefits for tie-based anonymity apps, including serving disclosure needs and social probing. Still, challenges for making such applications successful, for example the prevalence of negativity and bullying, are substantial.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Drexel University", "IT University of Copenhagen", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Xiao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiao", "Nazanin Andalibi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andalibi:Nazanin", "Louise Barkhuus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barkhuus:Louise", "Mor Naaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naaman:Mor"], "pages": 13}
