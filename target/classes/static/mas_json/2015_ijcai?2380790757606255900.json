{"title": "Maximum Entropy Semi-Supervised Inverse Reinforcement Learning.", "fields": ["apprenticeship learning", "semi supervised learning", "pairwise comparison", "ambiguity", "learning classifier system"], "abstract": "A popular approach to apprenticeship learning (AL) is to formulate it as an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem. The MaxEnt-IRL algorithm successfully integrates the maximum entropy principle into IRL and unlike its predecessors, it resolves the ambiguity arising from the fact that a possibly large number of policies could match the expert's behavior. In this paper, we study an AL setting in which in addition to the expert's trajectories, a number of unsupervised trajectories is available. We introduce MESSI, a novel algorithm that combines MaxEnt-IRL with principles coming from semi-supervised learning. In particular, MESSI integrates the unsupervised data into the MaxEnt-IRL framework using a pairwise penalty on trajectories. Empirical results in a highway driving and grid-world problems indicate that MESSI is able to take advantage of the unsupervised trajectories and improve the performance of MaxEnt-IRL.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Adobe Systems"], "authors": ["Julien Audiffren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Audiffren:Julien", "Michal Valko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valko:Michal", "Alessandro Lazaric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazaric:Alessandro", "Mohammad Ghavamzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghavamzadeh:Mohammad"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
