The short and informal nature of tweets, along with the imbalanced characteristics of suggestion tweets, makes the task extremely challenging. To this end, we develop a classification framework on Factorization Machines, which is effective and efficient especially in classification tasks with feature sparsity settings. Moreover, we tackle the imbalance problem by introducing cost-sensitive learning techniques in Factorization Machines. Extensively experimental studies on a manually annotated real-life data set show that the proposed approach significantly improves the baseline approach, and yields the precision of 71.06% and recall of 67.86%. We also investigate the reason why Factorization Machines perform better. Finally, we introduce the first manually annotated dataset for suggestion classification.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Li Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong_0004:Li", "Furu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Furu", "Yajuan Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Yajuan", "Xiaohua Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaohua", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming", "Ke Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Ke"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
