We give an algorithm for exactly reconstructing f given random examples from the uniform distribution on {- 1,1}n that runs in time polynomial in n and 2s and succeeds if the function satisfies the unique sign property: there is one output value which corresponds to a unique set of values of the participating parities. This sufficient condition is satisfied when every coefficient of f is perturbed by a small random noise, or satisfied with high probability when s parity functions are chosen randomly or when all the coefficients are positive. Learning sparse polynomials over the Boolean domain in time polynomial in n and 2s is considered notoriously hard in the worst-case. Our result shows that the problem is tractable for almost all sparse polynomials.\n\nThen, we show an application of this result to hypergraph sketching which is the problem of learning a sparse (both in the number of hyperedges and the size of the hyperedges) hypergraph from uniformly drawn random cuts. We also provide experimental results on a real world dataset.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Murat Kocaoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kocaoglu:Murat", "Karthikeyan Shanmugam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shanmugam:Karthikeyan", "Alexandros G.
