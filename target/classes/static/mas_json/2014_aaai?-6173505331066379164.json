{"title": "Prediction of Helpful Reviews Using Emotions Extraction.", "fields": ["emotionality", "lexicon", "helpfulness", "readability", "data analysis"], "abstract": "Reviews keep playing an increasingly important role in the decision process of buying products and booking hotels. However, the large amount of available information can be confusing to users. A more succinct interface, gathering only the most helpful reviews, can reduce information processing time and save effort. To create such an interface in real time, we need reliable prediction algorithms to classify and predict new reviews which have not been voted but are potentially helpful. So far such helpfulness prediction algorithms have benefited from structural aspects, such as the length and readability score. Since emotional words are at the heart of our written communication and are powerful to trigger listeners' attention, we believe that emotional words can serve as important parameters for predicting helpfulness of review text.\n\nUsing GALC, a general lexicon of emotional words associated with a model representing 20 different categories, we extracted the emotionality from the review text and applied supervised classification method to derive the emotion-based helpful review prediction. As the second contribution, we propose an evaluation framework comparing three different real-world datasets extracted from the most well-known product review websites. This framework shows that emotion-based methods are outperforming the structure-based approach, by up to 9%.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Lionel Martin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martin:Lionel", "Pearl Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Pearl"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
