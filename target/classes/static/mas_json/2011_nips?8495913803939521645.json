Modulated renewal processes allow these interevent distributions to vary with time, allowing the introduction of nonstationarity. In this work, we take a nonparametric Bayesian approach, modelling this nonstationarity with a Gaussian process. Our approach is based on the idea of uniformization, which allows us to draw exact samples from an otherwise intractable distribution. We develop a novel and efficient MCMC sampler for posterior inference. In our experiments, we test these on a number of synthetic and real datasets.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Vinayak Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Vinayak", "Yee Whye Teh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teh:Yee_Whye"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
