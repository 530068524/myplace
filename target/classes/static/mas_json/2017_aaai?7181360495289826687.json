Unfortunately, bringing these linguistic and pragmatic benefits to numerical optimization has proven surprisingly challenging. In this paper, we turn to these challenges: we introduce a rich modeling language, for which an interior-point method computes approximate solutions in a generic way. While logical features easily complicates the underlying model, often yielding intricate dependencies, we exploit and cache local structure using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). Indeed, standard matrix-vector algebra is efficiently realizable in ADDs, but we argue and show that well-known optimization methods are not ideal for ADDs. Our engine, therefore, invokes a sophisticated matrix-free approach. We demonstrate the flexibility of the resulting symbolic-numeric optimizer on decision making and compressed sensing tasks with millions of non-zero entries.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technical University of Dortmund", "Technical University of Dortmund", "Centre for Inte ... ir Applications", "~1,WEI Hua~1,CH ... 1,An Ying-hui~2", "College of Elec ... ng530004,China)", "Technical Colle ...  330032, China)"], "authors": ["Martin Mladenov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mladenov:Martin", "Vaishak Belle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belle:Vaishak", "Kristian Kersting.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kersting:Kristian"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
