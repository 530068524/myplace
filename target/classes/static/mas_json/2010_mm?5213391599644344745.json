It aims at facilitating fast prototyping and reproducible research for computer vision scientists and students. It includes rigorous implementations of common building blocks such as feature detectors, feature extractors, (hierarchical) k-means clustering, randomized kd-tree matching, and super-pixelization. The source code and interfaces are fully documented. The library integrates directly with MATLAB, a popular language for computer vision research.", "citation": "Citations (2,513)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Andrea Vedaldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vedaldi:Andrea", "Brian Fulkerson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fulkerson:Brian"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
