While this problem can be tackled using the model-based UI development (MBUID) process, the usability of the device-specific interfaces is still an open question. We are presenting a combined system that integrates MBUID with a cognitive modeling framework in order to provide usability predictions at development time. Because of their potential impact, our focus within usability problems lies on user errors. These are captured in a cognitive model that capitalizes on meta-information provided by the MBUID system such as the abstract role of a UI element within a task sequence (e.g., input, output, command). The free parameters of the cognitive model were constrained using data from two previous studies. A validation experiment featuring a new application and UI yielded an unexpected error pattern that was nonetheless consistent with the model predictions.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin"], "authors": ["Marc Halbr\u00fcgge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halbr=uuml=gge:Marc", "Michael Quade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quade:Michael", "Klaus-Peter Engelbrecht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Engelbrecht:Klaus=Peter", "Sebastian M\u00f6ller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=ouml=ller:Sebastian", "Sahin Albayrak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albayrak:Sahin"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
