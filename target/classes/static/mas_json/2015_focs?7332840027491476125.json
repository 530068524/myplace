Our hierarchy theorem says that for every  d  \u2265 2, there is an explicit  n -variable Boolean function  f , computed by a linear-size depth- d  formula, which is such that any depth-( d \u22121) circuit that agrees with  f  on (1/2 +  o   n  (1)) fraction of all inputs must have size exp( n  \u03a9 (1/d) ). This answers an open question posed by Hastad in his Ph.D. thesis (Hastad 1986b).   Our average-case depth hierarchy theorem implies that the polynomial hierarchy is infinite relative to a random oracle with probability 1, confirming a conjecture of Hastad (1986a), Cai (1986), and Babai (1987). We also use our result to show that there is no \u201capproximate converse\u201d to the results of Linial, Mansour, Nisan (Linial et al. 1993) and (Boppana 1997) on the total influence of bounded-depth circuits.   A key ingredient in our proof is a notion of  random projections  which generalize random restrictions.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "University of Toronto", "Columbia University", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "National Institute of Informatics", "Columbia University", "University of California"], "authors": ["Benjamin Rossman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossman:Benjamin", "Rocco A.
