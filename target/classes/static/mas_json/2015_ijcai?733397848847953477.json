{"title": "Detecting Emotions in Social Media: A Constrained Optimization Approach.", "fields": ["social media", "machine learning", "inference", "artificial intelligence", "constrained optimization"], "abstract": "Emotion detection can considerably enhance our understanding of users' emotional states. Understanding users' emotions especially in a real-time setting can be pivotal in improving user interactions and understanding their preferences. In this paper, we propose a constraint optimization framework to discover emotions from social media content of the users. Our framework employs several novel constraints such as emotion bindings, topic correlations, along with specialized features proposed by prior work and well-established emotion lexicons. We propose an efficient inference algorithm and report promising empirical results on three diverse datasets.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "IBM"], "authors": ["Yichen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yichen", "Aditya Pal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pal:Aditya"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
