Distinct features of heterogeneous events including opaque names, dislocated traces and composite events, prevent existing data integration from techniques performing well. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an event similarity function by iteratively evaluating similar neighbors. We prove the convergence of iterative similarity computation, and propose several pruning and estimation methods. To efficiently support matching composite events, we devise upper bounds of event similarities. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed event matching approaches can achieve significantly higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art matching methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "University of Texas\u2013Pan American", "Tsinghua University", "Peking University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Kent State University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Xiaochen Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaochen", "Shaoxu Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Shaoxu", "Xiang Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Xiang", "Jianmin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Jianmin", "Lei Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou_0001:Lei"], "pages": 12}
