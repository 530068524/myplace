{"title": "Multimedia on the Mountaintop: Using Public Snow Images to Improve Water Systems Operation.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "water level", "snow", "satellite imagery", "water scarcity"], "abstract": "This paper merges multimedia and environmental research to verify the utility of public web images for improving water management in periods of water scarcity, an increasingly critical event due to climate change. A multimedia processing pipeline fetches mountain images from multiple sources and extracts virtual snow indexes correlated to the amount of water accumulated in the snow pack. Such indexes are used to predict water availability and design the operating policy of Lake Como, Italy. The performance of this informed policy is contrasted, via simulation, with the current operation, which depends only on lake water level and day of the year, and with a policy that exploits official Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) estimated from ground stations data and satellite imagery. Virtual snow indexes allow improving the system performance by 11.6% w.r.t. the baseline operation, and yield further improvement when coupled with official SWE information, showing that the two data sources are complementary. The proposed approach exemplifies the opportunities and challenges of applying multimedia content analysis methods to complex environmental problems.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Andrea Castelletti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castelletti:Andrea", "Roman Fedorov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fedorov_0001:Roman", "Piero Fraternali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fraternali:Piero", "Matteo Giuliani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giuliani:Matteo"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
