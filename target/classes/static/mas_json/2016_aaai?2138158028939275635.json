This model allows for application of high-level syntactic transfer rules and low-level non-syntactic rules. It thus involves fully syntactic, non-syntactic, and partially syntactic derivations via a single grammar and decoding paradigm. On large-scale Chinese-English and English-Chinese translation tasks, we obtain an average improvement of +0.9 BLEU across the newswire and web genres.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Institute of Ps ...
