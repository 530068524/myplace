The fastest algorithm for this problem is a randomized algorithm with a total update time of $\\tilde O(mn/\\epsilon)$ and constant query time by Roditty and Zwick [SIAM J. Comput., 41 (2012), pp. 670--683]. The fastest deterministic algorithm is from a 1981 paper by Even and Shiloach [J. ACM, 28 (1981), pp. 1--4]; it has a total update time of $O(mn^2)$ and constant query time. We improve these results as follows: (1) We present an algorithm with a total update time of $\\tilde O(n^{5/2}/\\epsilon)$ and constant query time that has an additive error of 2 in addition to the $1+\\epsilon$ multiplicative error. This beats the previous $\\tilde O(mn/\\epsilon)$ time when $m=\\Omega(n^{3/2})$. Note that the additive error is unavoidable since, even in the static case, an $O(n^{3-\\delta})$-time (a so-called truly subcubic) combinatorial algorithm with...", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Vienna", "University of Vienna", "Nanyang Technological University", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Monika Henzinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henzinger:Monika", "Sebastian Krinninger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krinninger:Sebastian", "Danupon Nanongkai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nanongkai:Danupon"], "pages": 10}
