{"title": "Integration and Evaluation of a Matrix Factorization Sequencer in Large Commercial ITS.", "fields": ["data availability", "matrix decomposition", "user modeling", "knowledge acquisition", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Correct evaluation of Machine Learning based sequencers require large data availability, large scale experiments and consideration of different evaluation measures. Such constraints make the construction of ad-hoc Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) unfeasible and impose early integration in already existing ITS, which possesses a large amount of tasks to be sequenced. However, such systems were not designed to be combined with Machine Learning methods and require several adjustments. As a consequence more than a half of the components based on recommender technology are never evaluated with an online experiment. In this paper we show how we adapted a Matrix Factorization based performance predictor and a score based policy for task sequencing to be integrated in a commercial ITS with over 2000 tasks on 20 topics. We evaluated the experiment under different perspectives in comparison with the ITS sequencer designed by experts over the years. As a result we achieve same post-test results and outperform the current sequencer in the perceived experience questionnaire with almost no curriculum authoring effort. We also showed that the sequencer possess a better user modeling, better adapting to the knowledge acquisition rate of the students.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Hildesheim", "University of Hildesheim", "University of Hildesheim"], "authors": ["Carlotta Schatten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schatten:Carlotta", "Ruth Janning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Janning:Ruth", "Lars Schmidt-Thieme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt=Thieme:Lars"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
