We propose an approach that computes on the fly, a Personalized Social Document Representation (PSDR) of each document per user based on his social activities. The PSDRs are used to rank documents with respect to a query. This approach has been intensively evaluated on a large public dataset, showing significant benefits for personalized search.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Aristotle University of Thessaloniki", "PRiSM Laborator ... sailles, France", "SideTrade, Fran ... ancourt, France", "PRiSM Laborator ... sailles, France"], "authors": ["Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouadjenek:Mohamed_Reda", "Hakim Hacid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hacid:Hakim", "Mokrane Bouzeghoub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouzeghoub:Mokrane", "Athena Vakali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vakali:Athena"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
