Multi-slits visually present an image pattern through columns of slits that are arranged several spaces wide. They cannot be perceived image by stop patterns, but they can be perceived by scroll patterns. In this paper, we experimentally show that stereoscopic vision is possible by presenting binocular parallax images that impart the beam direction from slits.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "NTT Commun.
