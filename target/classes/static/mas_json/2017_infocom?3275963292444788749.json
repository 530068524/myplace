Stork introduces downstream attributes never before seen in (C)RFIDs: (i) fast feedback for CRFID downstream verification based on the internal EPC C1G2 memory check command \u2014 which we analytically and experimentally show to be the best possible downstream verification process based on EPC C1G2; (ii) ability to perform multi-CRFID transfer \u2014 which in our experiments speeds up downstream by more than two times compared to sequential transmission; and (iii) the use of compressed data streams \u2014 which improves firmware reprogramming times by up to 10% at large reader-to-CRFID distances.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Henko Aantjes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aantjes:Henko", "Amjad Yousef Majid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majid:Amjad_Yousef", "Przemyslaw Pawelczak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pawelczak:Przemyslaw", "Jethro Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Jethro", "Aaron N.
