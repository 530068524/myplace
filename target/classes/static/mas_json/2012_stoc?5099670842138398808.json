Moreover such a tree can be found in time O(m log n log log n). Our result is obtained using a new  petal-decomposition  approach which guarantees that the radius of each cluster in the tree is at most 4 times the radius of the induced subgraph of the cluster in the original graph.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ittai Abraham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abraham:Ittai", "Ofer Neiman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neiman:Ofer"], "pages": 12}
