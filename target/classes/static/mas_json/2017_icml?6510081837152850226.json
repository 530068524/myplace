Existing inference approaches for DGP models have limited scalability and are notoriously cumbersome to construct. In this work, we introduce a novel formulation of DGPs based on random feature expansions that we train using stochastic variational inference. This yields a practical learning framework which significantly advances the state-of-the-art in inference for DGPs, and enables accurate quantification of uncertainty. We extensively showcase the scalability and performance of our proposal on several datasets with up to 8 million observations, and various DGP architectures with up to 30 hidden layers.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Institut Eur\u00e9com", "NICTA", "Institut Eur\u00e9com", "Institut Eur\u00e9com"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Kurt Cutajar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cutajar:Kurt", "Edwin V.
