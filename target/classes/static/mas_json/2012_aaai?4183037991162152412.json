In this work, we propose a symbolic dynamic programming (SDP) solution to obtain the optimal closed-form value function and policy for CSA-MDPs with multivariate continuous state and actions, discrete noise, piecewise linear dynamics, and piecewise linear (or restricted piecewise quadratic) reward. Our key contribution over previous SDP work is to show how the continuous action maximization step in the dynamic programming backup can be evaluated optimally and symbolically -- a task which amounts to symbolic constrained optimization subject to unknown state parameters; we further integrate this technique to work with an efficient and compact data structure for SDP -- the extended algebraic decision diagram (XADD). We demonstrate empirical results on a didactic nonlinear planning example and two domains from operations research to show the first automated exact solution to these problems.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["NICTA", "NICTA", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Zahra Zamani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zamani:Zahra", "Scott Sanner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanner:Scott", "Cheng Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Cheng"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
