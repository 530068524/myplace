However, these approaches require data to be labeled and entirely available at the outset. In contrast, we formulate a continuous learning framework for context aware activity recognition from unlabeled video data which has two distinct advantages over most existing methods. First, we propose a novel active learning technique which not only exploits the informativeness of the individual activity instances but also utilizes their contextual information during the query selection process, this leads to significant reduction in expensive manual annotation effort. Second, the learned models can be adapted online as more data is available. We formulate a conditional random field (CRF) model that encodes the context and devise an information theoretic approach that utilizes entropy and mutual information of the nodes to compute the set of most informative query instances, which need to be labeled by a human. These labels are combined with graphical inference techniques for incrementally updating the model as new videos come in. Experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance with significantly less amount of manual labeling.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Mahmudul Hasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasan_0003:Mahmudul", "Amit K.
