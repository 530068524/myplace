Existing approaches for preventing user tracking, based on curated blocklists, suffer from limited coverage and coarse-grained resolution for classification, rely on exceptions that impact sites' functionality and appearance, and require significant manual maintenance. In this paper we propose a novel approach, based on the concepts leveraged from $k$-Anonymity, in which users collectively identify unsafe data elements, which have the potential to identify uniquely an individual user, and remove them from requests.\n\nWe deployed our system to 200,000 German users running the Cliqz Browser or the Cliqz Firefox extension to evaluate its efficiency and feasibility. Results indicate that our approach achieves better privacy protection than blocklists, as provided by Disconnect, while keeping the site breakage to a minimum, even lower than the community-optimized AdBlock Plus. We also provide evidence of the prevalence and reach of trackers to over 21 million pages of 350,000 unique sites, the largest scale empirical evaluation to date. 95% of the pages visited contain 3rd party requests to potential trackers and 78% attempt to transfer unsafe data. Tracker organizations are also ranked, showing that a single organization can reach up to 42% of all page visits in Germany.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Leeds Beckett University", "CLIQZ, Munich, Germany", "CLIQZ, Munich, Germany", "CLIQZ, Munich, Germany", "CLIQZ, Munich, Germany"], "authors": ["Zhonghao Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Zhonghao", "Sam Macbeth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Macbeth:Sam", "Konark Modi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Modi:Konark", "Josep M.
