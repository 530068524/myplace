In the language of hardness of approximation, this problem is equivalent to determining the smallest s such that getting an s-approximation for satisfiable 3-bit constraint satisfaction problems (\"3-CSPs\") is NP-hard. The previous best upper bound and lower bound for s are 20/27+\u00b5 by Khot and Saket [KS06], and 5/8 (assuming NP subseteq BPP) by Zwick [Zwi98]. In this paper we close the gap assuming Khot's d-to-1 Conjecture. Formally, we prove that if Khot's d-to-1 Conjecture holds for any finite constant integer d, then NP naPCP 1,5/8+ \u00b5 [O(log n),3] for any constant \u00b5 > 0. Our conditional result also solves Hastad's open question [Has01] on determining the inapproximability of satisfiable Max-NTW (\"Not Two\") instances and confirms Zwick's conjecture [Zwi98] that the 5/8-approximation algorithm for satisfiable 3-CSPs is optimal.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Ryan O'Donnell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Donnell:Ryan", "Yi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0002:Yi"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
