{"title": "Leveraging 3D PCRAM technologies to reduce checkpoint overhead for future exascale systems.", "fields": ["partitioned global address space", "massively parallel", "work stealing", "dimm", "petascale computing"], "abstract": "The scalability of future massively parallel processing (MPP) systems is challenged by high failure rates. Current hard disk drive (HDD) checkpointing results in overhead of 25% or more at the petascale. With a direct correlation between checkpoint frequencies and node counts, novel techniques that can take more frequent checkpoints with minimum overhead are critical to implement a reliable exascale system. In this work, we leverage the upcoming  Phase-Change Random Access Memory  (PCRAM) technology and propose a hybrid local/global checkpointing mechanism after a thorough analysis of MPP systems failure rates and failure sources.   We propose three variants of PCRAM-based hybrid checkpointing schemes,  DIMM + HDD, DIMM + DIMM , and  3D + 3D , to reduce the checkpoint overhead and offer a smooth transition from the conventional pure HDD checkpoint to the ideal 3D PCRAM mechanism. The proposed pure 3D PCRAM-based mechanism can ultimately take checkpoints with overhead less than 4% on a projected exascale system.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Pennsylvania State University"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Xiangyu Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Xiangyu", "Naveen Muralimanohar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muralimanohar:Naveen", "Norman P.
