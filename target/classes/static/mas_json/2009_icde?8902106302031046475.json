There is an increasing need for people to search a workflow repository using keywords and retrieve the relevant ones according to their interests. A workflow hierarchy is a three dimensional object containing multi-resolution abstraction views on the same workflow. This unique structure poses a new set of challenges compared to keyword search on tree or graph structures which are typically found in XML or relational data. In this demonstration, we present an effective workflow search engine, WISE, which returns informative and concise search results, defined as the minimal views of the most specific workflow hierarchies containing matching keywords.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Qihong Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Qihong", "Peng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Peng", "Yi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Yi"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
