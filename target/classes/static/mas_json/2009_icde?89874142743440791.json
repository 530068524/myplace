One of the most important challenges in P2P environments is to quickly locate relevant data across many participating peers. In this demonstration, we present psiX, which is an Internet-scale service for publishing and locating XML documents. This service runs on several PlanetLab nodes geographically spread across the globe. The psiX system adopts a suite of new techniques for XML indexing and pattern matching in a P2P network, namely, (a) representing XML documents and XPath queries compactly via algebraic signatures, (b) searching signatures of documents and value summaries indexed using distributed hierarchical indexesbuilt over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), and (c) gracefully adapting to failures while running on the Internet, where failures are a norm rather than an exception.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City", "University of Arizona"], "authors": ["Praveen Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Praveen", "Bongki Moon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moon:Bongki"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
