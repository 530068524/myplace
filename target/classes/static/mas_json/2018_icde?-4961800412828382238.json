With this novel paradigm a lot of new opportunities but also challenges emerge which requires a rethinking of database system developers regarding the programming model and data placement. In this paper, we present a design of an NVM-aware storage layout for tables using a multi-dimensional clustering approach and a block-like structure to utilize the complete memory stack. Contrary to previous works, this approach focuses on analytical workloads. In a microbenchmark, its potential for scan and point queries is investigated. We show that our approach is able to outperform the considered competitors by up to one order of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": [], "conf": "icde", "authors": ["Philipp G\u00f6tze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml=tze:Philipp", "Stephan Baumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baumann_0002:Stephan", "Kai-Uwe Sattler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sattler:Kai=Uwe"], "pages": 6}
