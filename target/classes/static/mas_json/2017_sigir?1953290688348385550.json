{"title": "Smart Media Generation System for Broadcasting Contents.", "fields": ["operator", "service provider", "broadcasting", "studio", "topic model"], "abstract": "Broadcasting contents are the most plausiable resources for services with video contents. Even though we already have huge amount of produced broadcasting contents, there rarely exists a system to analyze and generate information on broadcasting contents to support content retrieval and recommendation services. This paper proposes a new system for this purpose. In the proposed system, a broadcasting content is segmented into semantic units, scenes, based on its multiple characteristics. The proposed system analyzes scenes and generates their keywords, topics, and stories. Connections among scenes are automatically establishing based on shared keywords, similar topics, and consistency in stories. To support operators, the proposed system offers two tools: Scene Studio and SceneViz. We prepare several Open APIs in the proposed system to provide information and connections for service providers. The feasibility of the proposed system is shown with numerical evaluations on the qualities of generated information. We also introduce two video clip services implemented with our system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Electronics and ... on, South Korea", "Electronics and ... on, South Korea", "Electronics and ... on, South Korea", "Korean Broadcas ... ul, South Korea", "Electronics and ... on, South Korea"], "authors": ["Jeong Woo Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:Jeong_Woo", "Wonjoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Wonjoo", "Sang-Yun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sang=Yun", "Jinwoo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jinwoo", "Sun-Joong Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sun=Joong"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
