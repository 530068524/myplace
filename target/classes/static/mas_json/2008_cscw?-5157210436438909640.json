In this paper, we present a careful examination of responsiveness to instant messaging communication, showing, for example, that work-fragmentation significantly correlates with faster responsiveness. We show also that the presentation of the incoming communication significantly affects responsiveness (even more so than indicators that the communication was ongoing), suggesting the potential for dynamically influencing responsiveness. This work contributes to a better understanding of computer-mediated communication and to the design of new tools for computer-mediated communication.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Intel", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Daniel Avrahami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avrahami:Daniel", "Susan R.
