Currently, there are no effective anti-jamming solutions to secure OFDM wireless communications under reactive jamming attack. On the other hand, MIMO has emerged as a technology of great research interest in recent years mostly due to its capacity gain. In this paper, we explore the use of MIMO technology for jamming resilient OFDM communication, especially its capability to communicate against the powerful reactive jammer. We first investigate the jamming strategies and their impacts on the OFDM-MIMO receivers. We then present a MIMO-based anti-jamming scheme that exploits interference cancellation and transmit precoding capabilities of MIMO technology to turn a jammed non-connectivity scenario into an operational network. Our testbed evaluation shows the destructive power of reactive jamming attack, and also validates the efficacy and efficiency of our defense mechanisms.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Utah State University", "Virginia Polyte ... ksburg, VA, USA", "Virginia Polyte ... ksburg, VA, USA", "Virginia Polyte ... ksburg, VA, USA", "Virginia Polyte ... ksburg, VA, USA"], "authors": ["Qiben Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Qiben", "Huacheng Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Huacheng", "Tingting Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Tingting", "Ming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Ming", "Wenjing Lou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lou:Wenjing", "Y.
