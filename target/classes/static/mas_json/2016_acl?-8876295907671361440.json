Based on recordings of humans performing various types of syntactic face and head movements (which include idiosyncratic variation), we evaluate the efficacy of Continuous Profile Models (CPMs) at identifying an essential \u201clatent trace\u201d of the performance, for use in producing ASL animations. A metric-based evaluation and a study with deaf users indicated that this approach was more effective than a prior method for producing animations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Rochester Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hernisa Kacorri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kacorri:Hernisa", "Matt Huenerfauth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huenerfauth:Matt"], "pages": -1}
