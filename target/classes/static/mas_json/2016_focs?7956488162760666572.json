{"title": "Agnostic Estimation of Mean and Covariance.", "fields": ["singular value decomposition", "corollary", "robust statistics", "covariance function", "gaussian"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating the mean and covariance of a distribution from i.i.d. samples in the presence of a fraction of malicious noise. This is in contrast to much recent work where the noise itself is assumed to be from a distribution of known type. The agnostic problem includes many interesting special cases, e.g., learning the parameters of a single Gaussian (or finding the best-fit Gaussian) when a fraction of data is adversarially corrupted, agnostically learning mixtures, agnostic ICA, etc. We present polynomial-time algorithms to estimate the mean and covariance with error guarantees in terms of information-theoretic lower bounds. As a corollary, we also obtain an agnostic algorithm for Singular Value Decomposition.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Kevin A.
