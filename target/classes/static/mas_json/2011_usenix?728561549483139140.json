{"title": "Vsys: A Programmable sudo.", "fields": ["real time computing", "planetlab", "unix", "computer science", "overlay network"], "abstract": "We present Vsys, a mechanism for restricting access to privileged operations, much like the popular sudo tool on UNIX. Unlike sudo, Vsys allows privileges to be constrained using general-purpose programming languages and facilitates composing multiple system services into powerful abstractions for isolation. In use for over three years on PlanetLab, Vsys has enabled over 100 researchers to create private overlay networks, userlevel file systems, virtual switches, and TCP-variants that function safely and without interference. Vsys has also been used by applications such as whole-system monitoring in a VM. We describe the design of Vsys and discuss our experiences and lessons learned.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Imperial College London", "Princeton University", "Juniper Networks", "University of Napoli"], "authors": ["Sapan Bhatia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhatia:Sapan", "Giovanni Di Stasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stasi:Giovanni_Di", "Thom Haddow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haddow:Thom", "Andy C.
