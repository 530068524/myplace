Building on work by Derlega and Grzelak [12] on self- disclosure goals and focusing on the affordances of the site, findings reveal both commonalities with and extensions to existing communication research on self-disclosure, as users saw both benefits and drawbacks to the high visibility and persistence of content shared through the site. Furthermore, users employed a wide spectrum of strategies to help them achieve their disclosure goals while decreasing perceived risks associated with making disclosures in a public forum. Importantly, these strategies generally sought to recreate the offline boundaries blurred or removed by the technical structure of the site and allow users to engage in a more strategic disclosure process with their network.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Jessica Vitak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitak:Jessica", "Jinyoung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jinyoung"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 14}
