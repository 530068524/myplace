During the bug-fixing process, developers spend a high amount of manual effort investigating the bug in order to answer a series of questions about it. My research will support developers in answering the following questions about a bug:  Who is the most suitable developer to fix the bug?, Where is the bug located?, When was the bug inserted? and Why was the bug inserted?", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Francisco Servant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Servant:Francisco"], "pages": 4}
