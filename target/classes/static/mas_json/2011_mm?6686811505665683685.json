We observe that comprehensive aerial image databases are widely available while complete coverage of urban areas from the ground is at best spotty. As a result, localization of ground level imagery with respect to aerial collections is a technically important and practically significant problem. We exploit two key insights: (1) satellite image to oblique aerial image correspondences are used to extract building facades, and (2) building facades are matched between oblique aerial and ground images for geo-localization. Key contributions include: (1) A novel method for extracting building facades using building outlines; (2) Correspondence of building facades between oblique aerial and ground images without direct matching; and (3) Position and orientation estimation of ground images. We show results of ground image localization in a dense urban area.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["SRI International", "SRI International", "SRI International", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Mayank Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Mayank", "Harpreet S.
