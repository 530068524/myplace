{"title": "IR Evaluation: Modeling User Behavior for Measuring Effectiveness.", "fields": ["ir evaluation", "computer science", "xml retrieval", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "This half-day tutorial on IR evaluation combines an introduction to classical IR evaluation methods with material on more recent user-oriented approaches. We primarily focus on off-line evaluation, but some material on on-line evaluation is also covered. The broad goal of the tutorial is to equip researchers with an understanding of modern approaches to IR evaluation, facilitating new research on this topic and improving evaluation methodology for emerging areas.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University College London"], "authors": ["Charles L.
