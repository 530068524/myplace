{"title": "PoisonIvy: Safe speculation for secure memory.", "fields": ["implementation", "guard", "overhead", "speculation", "work stealing"], "abstract": "Encryption and integrity trees guard against physical attacks, but harm performance. Prior academic work has speculated around the latency of integrity verification, but has done so in an insecure manner. No industrial implementations of secure processors have included speculation. This work presents PoisonIvy, a mechanism which speculatively uses data before its integrity has been verified while preserving security and closing address-based side-channels. PoisonIvy reduces performance overheads from 40% to 20% for memory intensive workloads and down to 1.8%, on average.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Tamara Silbergleit Lehman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehman:Tamara_Silbergleit", "Andrew D.
