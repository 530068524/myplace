{"title": "Managing Expectations: Technology Tensions among Parents and Teens.", "fields": ["social psychology", "knowledge management", "pedagogy", "perception", "scholarship"], "abstract": "Extensive scholarship has investigated technology use among families. Existing work has focused primarily on parents\u00e2   reactions to and restrictions of their children\u00e2  s technology use; here, we explore the underlying tensions surrounding technology use in the home. We draw on historical perspectives of adolescence and family life to better understand technology\u00e2  s impact on present-day parents and teens. Through an interview study with 18 parent-child pairs (19 parents; 23 children, ages 10-17), we find a number of technology tensions, including 1) parents\u00e2   underestimation of children\u00e2  s technology use; 2) children\u00e2  s perception that parents only tell them which behaviors to avoid; 3) both parents\u00e2   and children\u00e2  s poor adherence to household technology rules; and 4) parents\u00e2   and children\u00e2  s desire for mutual attention. We argue that the use of personal devices introduces distinctive challenges into modern family life, due to the limited visibility (or practical obscurity) of personal device use, expectations of constant connectivity, and overly-romanticized notions of family time. We consider the historical evolution of both teenage and family life, and conclude that consistent and realistic expectations around work, attention, and adolescence may help families better manage household technology use.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Lindsay Blackwell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blackwell:Lindsay", "Emma Gardiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gardiner:Emma", "Sarita Yardi Schoenebeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schoenebeck:Sarita_Yardi"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
