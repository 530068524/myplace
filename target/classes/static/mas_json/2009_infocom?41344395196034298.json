The problem arises in a target defence scenario, where the objective is to destroy the intruding targets using the minimum-cost pre-deployed mines. Due to the problem complexity, we first transform it using a novel bucket-tub model, and then propose several approximation algorithms. Among them, it is shown that the layering algorithm can achieve an approximation ratio of alpha ldr f, where alpha ges 1 is the tunable relaxation factor and f is the maximum number of mines that a target is associated with, and that the greedy algorithm has an approximation ratio of Sigma j  R j , where R j  is the coefficient in the related integer program. We also present a localized greedy algorithm which is shown to produce the same solution set as the global greedy algorithm. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Changlei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Changlei", "Guohong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Guohong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
