{"title": "Crowdfunding inside the enterprise: employee-initiatives for innovation and collaboration.", "fields": ["intranet", "comparative research", "computer science", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "We describe a first experiment in enterprise crowdfunding - i.e., employees allocating money for employee-initiated proposals at an Intranet site, including a trial of this system with 511 employees in IBM Research. Major outcomes include: employee proposals that addressed diverse individual and organizational needs; high participation rates; extensive inter-departmental collaboration, including the discovery of large numbers of previously unknown collaborators; and the development of goals and motivations based on collective concerns at multiple levels of project groups, communities of practice, and the organization as a whole. We recommend further, comparative research into crowd-funding and other forms of employee-initiated innovations.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Michael J.
