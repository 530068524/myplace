{"title": "Fuzzy matching of Web queries to structured data.", "fields": ["web query classification", "web application", "web content", "web search query", "web modeling"], "abstract": "Recognizing the alternative ways people use to reference an entity, is important for many Web applications that query structured data. In such applications, there is often a mismatch between how content creators describe entities and how different users try to retrieve them. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining whether a candidate query approximately matches with an entity. We propose an off-line, data-driven, bottom-up approach that mines query logs for instances where Web content creators and Web users apply a variety of strings to refer to the same Web pages. This way, given a set of strings that reference entities, we generate an expanded set of equivalent strings for each entity. The proposed method is verified with experiments on real-life data sets showing that we can dramatically increase the queries that can be matched.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Tao Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Tao", "Hady Wirawan Lauw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lauw:Hady_Wirawan", "Stelios Paparizos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paparizos:Stelios"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
