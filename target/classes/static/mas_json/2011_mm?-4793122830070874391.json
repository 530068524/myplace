This brings a need for an intuitive control capable of fully exploiting the rendering capabilities of the complete lighting infrastructure. In this paper we present a new method to automatically create lighting atmospheres in any type of environment, that allows for an natural interaction with the lighting system and generates unique, suggestive effects. To prove the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution, we deploy the system in several application scenarios, and discuss the results.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Philips", "Philips"], "authors": ["Tommaso Gritti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gritti:Tommaso", "Gianluca Monaci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monaci:Gianluca"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
