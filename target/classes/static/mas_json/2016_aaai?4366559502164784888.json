We are interested in the class discovery problem for this setting. Specifically, given a large collection of audio recordings containing bird and other sounds, we aim to automatically select a fixed size subset of the recordings for human expert labeling such that the maximum number of species/classes is discovered. We employ a multi-instance multi-label representation to address multiple simultaneously vocalizing birds with sounds that overlap in time, and propose new algorithms for species/class discovery using this representation. In a comparative study, we show that the proposed methods discover more species/classes than current state-of-the-art in a real world dataset of 92,095 ten-second recordings collected in field conditions.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Facebook", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Forrest Briggs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Briggs:Forrest", "Xiaoli Z.
