While we may similarly expect that cooccurrence statistics can be used to capture rich information about the relationships between different words, existing approaches for modeling such relationships are based on manipulating pre-trained\n word vectors. In this paper, we introduce a novel method which directly learns relation vectors from co-occurrence statistics. To this end, we first introduce a variant  of GloVe, in which there is an explicit connection between word vectors and PMI weighted co-occurrence vectors. We then show how relation vectors can be naturally embedded into the resulting vector space", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Cardiff University", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Cardiff University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shoaib Jameel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jameel:Shoaib", "Zied Bouraoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouraoui:Zied", "Steven Schockaert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schockaert:Steven"], "pages": 11}
