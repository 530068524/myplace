Our resulting signature scheme is secure, in the random oracle model, based on the worst-case hardness of the O(n1.5)-SIVP problem in general lattices. The secret key, public key, and the signature size of our scheme are smaller than in all previous instantiations of the hash-and-sign signature, and our signing algorithm is also quite simple, requiring just a few matrix-vector multiplications and rejection samplings. We then also show that by slightly changing the parameters, one can get even more efficient signatures that are based on the hardness of the Learning With Errors problem. Our construction naturally transfers to the ring setting, where the size of the public and secret keys can be significantly shrunk, which results in the most practical to-date provably secure signature scheme based on lattices.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Vadim Lyubashevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyubashevsky:Vadim"], "pages": 18}
