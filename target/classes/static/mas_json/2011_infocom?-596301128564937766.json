This results in a tight coupling between tenants and landlord, extensive human resource deployment, and long ticket resolution time. We propose Routing-as-a-Service (RaaS), a framework for tenant-directed route control in data centers. We show that RaaS-based implementation provides a route control platform for multiple tenants to perform route control independently with little administrative involvement, and for the landlord to set the overall network policies. RaaS-based solutions can run on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and leverage existing technologies, so it can be implemented in existing networks without major infrastructural overhaul. We present the design of RaaS, introduce its components, and evaluate a prototype based on RaaS.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Chao-Chih Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chao=Chih", "Lihua Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Lihua", "Albert G.
