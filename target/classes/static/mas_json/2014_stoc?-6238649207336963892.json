{"title": "Testing surface area with arbitrary accuracy.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "manifold", "property testing", "randomized algorithm", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "Recently, Kothari et al. gave an algorithm for testing the surface area of an arbitrary set  A  \u2282 [0,1]  n  . Specifically, they gave a randomized algorithm such that if  A 's surface area is less than  S  then the algorithm will accept with high probability, and if the algorithm accepts with high probability then there is some perturbation of  A  with surface area at most  \u03ba   n   S . Here,  \u03ba   n   is a dimension-dependent constant which is strictly larger than 1 if  n  \u2265 2, and grows to 4/ \u03c0  as  n  \u2192 \u221e.   We give an improved analysis of Kothari et al.'s algorithm. In doing so, we replace the constant  \u03ba   n   with 1+ \u03b7  for  \u03b7  > 0 arbitrary. We also extend the algorithm to more general measures on Riemannian manifolds.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Joe Neeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neeman:Joe"], "pages": 5}
