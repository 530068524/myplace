The telephoto image is displayed using a projector with a steerable mirror, and overlaid on the wide-angle image that is displayed using a second projector.   We have deployed e-Fovea in two installations to demonstrate its feasibility. We have also conducted two user studies, with a total of 36 participants, to compare e-Fovea to two existing multi-resolution visual monitoring designs. The user study results show that for visual monitoring tasks, our e-Fovea design with steerable focus is significantly faster than existing approaches and preferred by users", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Kuan-Wen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Kuan=Wen", "Chih-Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chih=Wei", "Mike Y.
