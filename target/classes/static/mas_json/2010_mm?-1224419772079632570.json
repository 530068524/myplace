Unlike most manifold learning models that emphasize the distance preserving, we propose a novel algorithm called maximum distance embedding (MDE), which aims to maximize the distances between some particular pairs of data points, with the intention of flattening the local nonlinearity and keeping the discriminant information simultaneously in the embedded feature space. Moreover, MDE measures the dissimilarity between data points using L1-norm distance, which is more robust to outliers than widely used Frobenius norm distance. To adapt the nature tensor structure of image and video data, we further propose the multilinear MDE (M2DE). Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that both MDE and M2DE achieve impressive embedding results of image and video data for classification tasks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0007:Yang", "Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0004:Yan", "Keith C.
