We demonstrate the utility of our method by providing a new SDP-hierarchy based algorithm for constraint satisfaction problems with 2-variable constraints (2-CSP's). More concretely, we show for every $2$-CSP instance $\\Ins$, a rounding algorithm for $r$ rounds of the Lasserre SDP hierarchy for $\\Ins$ that obtains an integral solution which is at most $\\e$ worse than the relaxation's value (normalized to lie in $[0,1]$), as long as\\[ r g,\\]where $k$ is the alphabet size of $\\Ins$, $\\theta=\\poly(\\e/k)$, and $\\rank_{\\geq \\theta}(\\Ins)$ denotes the number of eigen values larger than $\\theta$ in the normalized adjacency matrix of the constraint graph of $\\Ins$. In the case that $\\Ins$ is a \\unique games instance, the threshold $\\theta$ is only a polynomial in $\\e$, and is independent of the alphabet size. Also in this case, we can give a non-trivial bound on the number of rounds for \\emph{every} instance. In particular our result yields an SDP-hierarchy based algorithm that matches the performance of the recent sub exponential algorithm of Aurora, Barak and Steurer (FOCS 2010) in the worst case, but runs faster on a natural family of instances, thus further restricting the set of possible hard instances for Khot's Unique Games Conjecture. Our algorithm actually requires less than the $n^{O(r)}$ constraints specified by the $r^{th}$ level of the Lasserre hierarchy, and in some cases $r$ rounds of our program can be evaluated in time$2^{O(r)}\\poly(n)$.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Boaz Barak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barak:Boaz", "Prasad Raghavendra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavendra:Prasad", "David Steurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steurer:David"], "pages": 10}
