As a corollary, we obtain sub-exponential size lower bounds for linear programming relaxations that beat random guessing for many CSPs such as MAX-CUT and MAX-3SAT. This is a nearly-exponential improvement over previous results; previously, the best known lower bounds were quasi-polynomial in  n  (Chan, Lee, Raghavendra, Steurer 2013).   Our bounds are obtained by exploiting and extending the recent progress in communication complexity for \"lifting\" query lower bounds to communication problems. The main ingredient in our results is a new structural result on \u00e2  high-entropy rectangles\u00e2   that may of independent interest in communication complexity.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Pravesh K.
