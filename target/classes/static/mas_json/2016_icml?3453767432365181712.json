This article provides, through a novel random matrix framework, the quantitative counterpart of these performance results, specifically in the case of echo-state networks. Beyond mere insights, our approach conveys a deeper understanding on the core mechanism under play for both training and testing.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["CentraleSup\u00e9lec", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "CentraleSup\u00e9lec", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Romain Couillet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Couillet:Romain", "Gilles Wainrib.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wainrib:Gilles", "Hafiz Tiomoko Ali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ali:Hafiz_Tiomoko", "Harry Sevi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sevi:Harry"], "pages": 9}
