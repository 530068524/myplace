{"title": "Dynamic Partitioning of Big Hierarchical Graphs.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "graph", "vertex", "big data", "schema"], "abstract": "Hierarchical graphs are multigraphs, which have as vertices the leaf nodes of a tree that lays out a hierarchy, and as edges the interactions between the entities represented by these nodes. In this paper we deal with the management of records that are the edges of such a graph by describing a model that fits well in a number of applications, many of which deal with very big volumes of streaming distributed data that have to be stored in a way so as their future retrieval and analysis will be efficient. We formally define a partitioning schema that respects the hierarchy tree, and apply these ideas by using well known open source big data tools such as Apache Hadoop and HBase on a small cluster. We built a framework on which we examine some basic policies for the partitioning of such graphs and draw interesting conclusions regarding the quality of the partitions produced and their effectiveness in processing analytical queries drawn from the imposed hierarchy.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Athens University of Economics and Business", "Athens University of Economics and Business"], "authors": ["Vasilis Spyropoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spyropoulos:Vasilis", "Yannis Kotidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotidis:Yannis"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
