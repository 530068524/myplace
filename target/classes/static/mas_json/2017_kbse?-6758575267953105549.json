Traditionally, a text search is limited to static source code files. In this paper, we introduce a simple approach, RuntimeSearch, where the given term is searched in the values of all string expressions in a running program. When a match is found, the program is paused and its runtime properties can be explored with a traditional debugger. The feasibility and usefulness of RuntimeSearch is demonstrated on a medium-sized Java project.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technical University of Ko\u0161ice", "Technical University of Ko\u0161ice"], "authors": ["Mat\u00fas Sul\u00edr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sul=iacute=r:Mat=uacute=s", "Jaroslav Porub\u00e4n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Porub=auml=n:Jaroslav"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
