{"title": "On k-skip shortest paths.", "fields": ["distance", "vertex", "spatial network", "graph", "shortest path problem"], "abstract": "Given two vertices s, t in a graph, let P be the shortest path (SP) from  s  to  t , and  P*  a subset of the vertices in  P .  P*  is a  k -skip shortest path from  s  to  t , if it includes at least a vertex out of every  k  consecutive vertices in  P . In general,  P*  succinctly describes  P  by sampling the vertices in  P  with a rate of at least 1/k. This makes  P*  a natural substitute in scenarios where reporting every single vertex of  P  is unnecessary or even undesired.   This paper studies  k -skip  SP  computation in the context of  spatial network databases (SNDB) . Our technique has two properties crucial for real-time query processing in SNDB. First, our solution is able to answer  k -skip queries  significantly faster  than finding the original  SPs  in their entirety. Second, the previous objective is achieved with a structure that occupies  less space  than storing the underlying road network. The proposed algorithms are the outcome of a careful theoretical analysis that reveals valuable insight into the characteristics of the  k -skip  SP  problem. Their efficiency has been confirmed by extensive experiments with real data.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei", "Cheng Sheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheng_0001:Cheng", "Jian Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Jian"], "pages": 12}
