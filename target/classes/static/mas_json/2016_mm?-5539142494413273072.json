Starting with an initial label deficient face image training set, we iteratively train a deep neural network and use this model to choose the examples for further manual annotation. We follow the active learning strategy and derive the Value of Information criterion to actively select candidate annotation images. During these iterations, the deep neural network is incrementally updated. Experimental results conducted on LFW benchmark and MS-Celeb-1M challenge demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Hao Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Hao", "Weiyuan Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Weiyuan", "Hong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hong", "Jianqi Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Jianqi", "Li Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Li", "Yingbin Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yingbin", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 5}
