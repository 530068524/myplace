This provides a method for answer set computation by computing models of completion. One particular attractive candidate for the latter task is pseudo-boolean constraint solvers. To strengthen this connection, we show examples of compact encoding of aggregates and global constraints by pseudo-boolean constraints.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Jia-Huai You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Jia=Huai", "Guohua Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Guohua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
