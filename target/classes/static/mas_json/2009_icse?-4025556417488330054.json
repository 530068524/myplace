The fragmented nature of these specifications can hinder validation as it is difficult to understand if the specifications for the various operations fit together well. In this paper we propose a novel technique for automatically constructing abstractions in the form of behaviour models from pre/post condition-based specifications. The level of abstraction at which such models are constructed preserves enabledness of sets of operations, resulting in a finite model that is intuitive to validate and which facilitates tracing back to the specification for debugging. The paper also reports on the application of the approach to an industrial strength protocol specification in which concerns were identified.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Buenos Aires", "University of Buenos Aires", "University of Buenos Aires", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Guido de Caso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caso:Guido_de", "V\u00edctor A.
