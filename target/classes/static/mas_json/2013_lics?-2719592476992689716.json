For this reason we propose alernative definitions of stability, which we call local and hybrid variance, and which express how rewards on each run deviate from the run's own mean-payoff and from the expected mean-payoff, respectively. We show that a strategy ensuring both the expected mean-payoff and the variance below given bounds requires randomization and memory, under all the above semantics of variance. We then look at the problem of determining whether there is a such a strategy. For the global variance, we show that the problem is in PSPACE, and that the answer can be approximated in pseudo-polynomial time. For the hybrid variance, the analogous decision problem is in NP, and a polynomial-time approximating algorithm also exists. For local variance, we show that the decision problem is in NP. Since the overall performance can be traded for stability (and vice versa), we also present algorithms for approximating the associated Pareto curve in all the three cases. Finally, we study a special case of the decision problems, where we require a given expected mean-payoff together with zero variance. Here we show that the problems can be all solved in polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Masaryk University", "University of Oxford", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "University of Oxford", "Masaryk University", "Masaryk University", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "University of Oxford", "Masaryk University"], "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s Br\u00e1zdil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Br=aacute=zdil:Tom=aacute=s", "Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Vojtech Forejt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forejt:Vojtech", "Anton\u00edn Kucera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kucera:Anton=iacute=n"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
