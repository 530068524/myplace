We introduce a deep scattering convolution network, with complex wavelet filters over spatial and angular variables. This representation brings an important improvement to results previously obtained with predefined features over object image databases such as Caltech and CIFAR. The resulting accuracy is comparable to results obtained with unsupervised deep learning and dictionary based representations. This shows that refining image representations by using geometric priors is a promising direction to improve image classification and its understanding.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Edouard Oyallon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oyallon:Edouard", "St\u00e9phane Mallat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mallat:St=eacute=phane"], "pages": 9}
