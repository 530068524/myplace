Like related methods, iPMCMC is a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler on an extended space. We present empirical results that show significant improvements in mixing rates relative to both noninteracting PMCMC samplers and a single PM-CMC sampler with an equivalent memory and computational budget. An additional advantage of the iPMCMC method is that it is suitable for distributed and multi-core architectures.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Link\u00f6ping University", "Uppsala University", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Tom Rainforth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rainforth:Tom", "Christian A.
