This may be seen as a natural generalisation of the non-uniform quantified constraint satisfaction problem QCSP(B). We introduce surjective hyper-endomorphisms and use them in proving a Galois connection that characterises definability in positive equality-free FO. Through an algebraic method, we derive a complete complexity classification for our problems as B ranges over structures of size at most three. Specifically, each problem is either in Logspace, is NP-complete, is coNP-complete or is Pspace-complete.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Durham University", "Durham University", "Lab. d'algorith ...
