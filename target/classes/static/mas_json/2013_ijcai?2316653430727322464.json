{"title": "Scalable Dynamic Nonparametric Bayesian Models of Content and Users.", "fields": ["approximate inference", "user modeling", "probabilistic logic", "topic model", "graphical model"], "abstract": "Online content have become an important medium to disseminate information and express opinions. With their proliferation, users are faced with the problem of missing the big picture in a sea of irrelevant and/or diverse content. In this paper, we addresses the problem of information organization of online document collections, and provide algorithms that create a structured representation of the otherwise unstructured content. We leverage the expressiveness of latent probabilistic models (e.g., topic models) and non-parametric Bayes techniques (e.g., Dirichlet processes), and give online and distributed inference algorithms that scale to terabyte datasets and adapt the inferred representation with the arrival of new documents.
