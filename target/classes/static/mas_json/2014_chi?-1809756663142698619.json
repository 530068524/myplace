We identify a new route to impact, namely addressing the psychological barriers that interfere with political mobilization toward limiting the use of fossil fuels. Five barriers are explored as a means of re-focusing research objectives for the community.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Bran Knowles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knowles:Bran", "Lynne Blair.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blair:Lynne", "Paul Coulton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coulton:Paul", "Mark Lochrie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lochrie:Mark"], "pages": 4}
