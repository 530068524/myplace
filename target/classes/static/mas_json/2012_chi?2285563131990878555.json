VS  models a video as a space-time cube and visualizes the video cube using real-time volume rendering techniques.  VS  empowers a user to interactively manipulate the video cube. We show that  VS  can quickly summarize both the static and dynamic video content by visualizing the space-time information in 3D. We demonstrate that  VS  enables a user to quickly look into the video cube, understand the content, and navigate to the content of interest.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Portland State University", "Portland State University", "Portland State University"], "authors": ["Cuong Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Cuong", "Yuzhen Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Yuzhen", "Feng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0015:Feng"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
