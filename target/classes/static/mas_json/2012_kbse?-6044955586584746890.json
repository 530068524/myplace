The tool supports static analysis as well as ACTL and past-time LTL model checking using counterexample-guided abstraction refinement for different programming languages used in industry. In the underlying principles of the framework, knowledge about the hardware platform is exploited so as to provide efficient techniques. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated on programs implemented using a combination of programming languages.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "Verified System ... tional, Germany"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Sebastian Biallas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biallas:Sebastian", "J\u00f6rg Brauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brauer:J=ouml=rg", "Stefan Kowalewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kowalewski:Stefan"], "pages": 4}
