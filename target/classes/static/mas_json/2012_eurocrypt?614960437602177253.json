The security of almost all coding and LPN/LWE-based schemes relies on the assumption that it is hard to decode random linear codes. Recently, there has been progress in improving the running time of the best decoding algorithms for binary random codes. The ball collision technique of Bernstein, Lange and Peters lowered the complexity of Stern's information set decoding algorithm to 20.0556n. Using representations this bound was improved to 20.0537n by May, Meurer and Thomae. We show how to further increase the number of representations and propose a new information set decoding algorithm with running time 20.0494n.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Laboratoire PRI ... uentin, France", "Laboratoire PRI ... nd DGA, France"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Anja Becker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Becker_0001:Anja", "Antoine Joux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joux:Antoine", "Alexander May.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/May_0001:Alexander", "Alexander Meurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meurer:Alexander"], "pages": 17}
