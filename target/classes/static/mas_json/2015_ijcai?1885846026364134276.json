{"title": "Mobility Profiling for User Verification with Anonymized Location Data.", "fields": ["data set", "mobility model", "profiling", "hidden markov model", "authentication"], "abstract": "Mobile user verification is to authenticate whether a given user is the legitimate user of a smartphone device. Unlike the current methods that commonly require users active cooperation, such as entering a short pin or a one-stroke draw pattern, we propose a new passive verification method that requires minimal imposition of users through modelling users subtle mobility patterns. Specifically, our method computes the statistical ambience features on WiFi and cell tower data from location anonymized data sets and then we customize Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of each user's mobility behaviors. Our learned model is subsequently validated and applied to verify a test user in a time-evolving manner through sequential likelihood test. Experimentally, our method achieves 72% verification accuracy with less than a day's data and a detection rate of 94% of illegitimate users with only 2 hours of selected data. As the first verification method that models users' mobility pattern on location-anonymized smartphone data, our achieved result is significant showing the good possibility of leveraging such information for live user authentication.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "McLaren Applied ... nologies, APAC"], "authors": ["Miao Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Miao", "Hong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Hong", "Vincent W.
