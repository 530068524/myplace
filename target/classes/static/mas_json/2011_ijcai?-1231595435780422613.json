{"title": "A Natural Language Question Answering System as a Participant in Human Q&A Portals.", "fields": ["automated theorem proving", "question answering", "classifier", "artificial intelligence system", "knowledge representation and reasoning"], "abstract": "LogAnswer is a question answering (QA) system for the German language, aimed at providing concise and correct answers to arbitrary questions. For this purpose LogAnswer is designed as an embedded artificial intelligence system which integrates methods from several fields of AI, namely natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation and automated theorem proving. We intend to employ LogAnswer as a virtual user within Internet-based QA forums, where it must be able to identify the questions that it cannot answer correctly, a task that normally receives little attention in QA research compared to the actual answer derivation. The paper presents a machine learning solution to the wrong answer avoidance (WAA) problem, applying a meta classifier to the output of simple term-based classifiers and a rich set of other WAA features. Experiments with a large set of real-world questions from a QA forum show that the proposed method significantly improves the WAA characteristics of our system.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["FernUniversit\u00e4t Hagen", "FernUniversit\u00e4t Hagen", "University Kobl ... andau, Germany", "University Kobl ... andau, Germany"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Tiansi Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Tiansi", "Ulrich Furbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furbach:Ulrich", "Ingo Gl\u00f6ckner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gl=ouml=ckner:Ingo", "Bj\u00f6rn Pelzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pelzer:Bj=ouml=rn"], "pages": 6}
