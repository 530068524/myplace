In addition to browsing a video by shots it also allows a user to navigate through a video with extended seeker bars showing time-related content abstractions. Users having a rough knowledge about the content characteristics of scenes to be found can efficiently use these extended seeker bars to quickly find these scenes by interactive navigation. Moreover, users can easily perform similarity queries by utilizing content knowledge that has been gained during the browsing/navigation process. These queries can also be stored and reused for search in other videos having similar/same content. Furthermore, the tool can execute many queries at once and visualize the results as semantic events in a different seeker bar. Our tool provides a real alternative for situations where a user currently needs to employ a common video player for the task of search and navigation.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Klagenfurt Univ ... enfurt, Austria"], "authors": ["Klaus Schoeffmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schoeffmann:Klaus"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
