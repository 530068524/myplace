This framework yields unconditional impossibility results that are applicable to any LP as opposed to only programs generated by hierarchies. Using our framework, we prove that O(n1/2-\u03f5)-approximations for CLIQUE require LPs of size 2n\u03a9(\u03f5). This lower bound applies to LPs using a certain encoding of CLIQUE as a linear optimization problem. Moreover, we establish a similar result for approximations of semidefinite programs by LPs. Our main technical ingredient is a quantitative improvement of Razborov\u2019s [38] rectangle corruption lemma for the high error regime, which gives strong lower bounds on the nonnegative rank of shifts of the unique disjointness matrix.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Cornell University", "Inst. fur Inf., ... eipzig, Germany", "Dept. of Math., ... ussels, Belgium"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["G\u00e1bor Braun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braun:G=aacute=bor", "Samuel Fiorini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiorini:Samuel", "Sebastian Pokutta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pokutta:Sebastian", "David Steurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steurer:David"], "pages": 10}
