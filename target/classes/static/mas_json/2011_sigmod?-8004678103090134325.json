Enterprises often use such tools with parameterized models and need to explore a large parameter space in order to discover parameter values that optimize for a given goal. Parameter space is usually very large, making such exploration extremely expensive. We present Jigsaw, a probabilistic database-based simulation framework that addresses this performance problem. In Jigsaw, users define what-if style scenarios as parameterized probabilistic database queries and identify parameter values that achieve desired properties. Jigsaw uses a novel \"fingerprinting\" technique that efficiently identifies correlations between a query's output distribution for different parameter values. Using fingerprints, Jigsaw is able to reuse work performed for different parameter values, and obtain speedups of as much as 2 orders of magnitude for several real business scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Oliver Kennedy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kennedy:Oliver", "Suman Nath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nath:Suman"], "pages": 12}
