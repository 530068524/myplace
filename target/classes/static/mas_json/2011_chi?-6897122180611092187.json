It has been previously observed that sliding one's finger across the screen may help reduce this oscillation. In this work, we empirically confirm this advantage by (1) measuring finger oscillation during different actions and (2) comparing error rate and user satisfaction between traditional tapping and swabbing in which the user slides his finger towards a target on a screen edge to select it. We found that oscillation is generally reduced during sliding. Also, compared to tapping, swabbing resulted in improved error rates and user satisfaction. We believe that swabbing will make touchscreens more accessible to senior users with tremor.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chat Wacharamanotham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wacharamanotham:Chat", "Jan Hurtmanns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hurtmanns:Jan", "Alexander Mertens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mertens:Alexander", "Martin Kronenbuerger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kronenbuerger:Martin", "Christopher M.
