In this paper we describe preliminary results of a small, innovative, student research study, which is yet to be validated with subsequent user studies. Its aim is to identify requirements for the task of brain tumour surgery, toward a wider project considering the development of a tumour removing robot. 5 brain tumour operations are observed using the ethnographic approach of work-practice observation informed by an ethnomethodological orientation. 4 observations are noted and corroborated with examples in evidence. We conclude that this study has identified potential requirements for a surgical robot, which would not have been highlighted using traditional approaches employed in the field of surgical robotics. These requirements may need to be validated with user-studies before being added to a requirements specification for a surgical robot.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Anthony Masih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masih:Anthony"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
