We introduce a new analysis of the standard SDP in this case that involves correlations among distant vertices. It also leads to a parallel repetition theorem for unique games when the graph is an expander.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Princeton University", "New York University", "University of California, Berkeley", "Princeton University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Sanjeev Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora:Sanjeev", "Subhash Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Subhash", "Alexandra Kolla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolla:Alexandra", "David Steurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steurer:David", "Madhur Tulsiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tulsiani:Madhur", "Nisheeth K.
