{"title": "Weighted model counting beyond two-variable logic.", "fields": ["symbol", "prefix", "enumerative combinatorics", "counting problem", "of the form"], "abstract": "It was recently shown by van den Broeck at al. that the symmetric weighted first-order model counting problem (WFOMC) for sentences of two-variable logic FO2 is in polynomial time, while it is #P1-complete for some FO3-sentences. We extend the result for FO2 in two independent directions: to sentences of the form p\u2227\u2200x\u2203=1 y \u03c8 (x, y) with p and \u03c8 formulated in FO2 and to sentences of the uniform one-dimensional fragment U1 of FO, a recently introduced extension of two-variable logic with the capacity to deal with relation symbols of all arities. We note that the former generalizes the extension of FO2 with a functional relation symbol. We also identify a complete classification of first-order prefix classes according to whether WFOMC is in polynomial time or #P1-complete.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Bremen"], "authors": ["Antti Kuusisto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuusisto:Antti", "Carsten Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutz:Carsten"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
