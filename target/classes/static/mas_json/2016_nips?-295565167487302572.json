Although several stochastic gradient based optimization algorithms have been recently proposed to solve this problem, no global convergence guarantee was provided by any of them. Inspired by the alternating least squares/power iterations formulation of CCA, and the shift-and-invert preconditioning method for PCA, we propose two globally convergent meta-algorithms for CCA, both of which transform the original problem into sequences of least squares problems that need only be solved approximately. We instantiate the meta-algorithms with state-of-the-art SGD methods and obtain time complexities that significantly improve upon that of previous work. Experimental results demonstrate their superior performance.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "authors": ["Weiran Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Weiran", "Jialei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jialei", "Dan Garber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garber:Dan", "Nati Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nati"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
