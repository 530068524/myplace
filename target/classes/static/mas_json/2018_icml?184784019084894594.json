Working with an Euler-Maruyama discretisation for the diffusion, we use variational inference to jointly learn the parameters and the diffusion paths. We use a standard mean-field variational approximation of the parameter posterior, and introduce a recurrent neural network to approximate the posterior for the diffusion paths conditional on the parameters. This neural network learns how to provide Gaussian state transitions which bridge between observations in a very similar way to the conditioned diffusion process. The resulting black-box inference method can be applied to any SDE system with light tuning requirements. We illustrate the method on a Lotka-Volterra system and an epidemic model, producing accurate parameter estimates in a few hours.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "authors": ["Thomas Ryder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryder:Thomas", "Andrew Golightly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golightly:Andrew", "A.
