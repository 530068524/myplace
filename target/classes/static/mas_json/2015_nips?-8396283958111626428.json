Most Bayesian optimization methods require auxiliary optimization: an additional non-convex global optimization problem, which can be time-consuming and hard to implement in practice. Also, the existing Bayesian optimization method with exponential convergence [1] requires access to the \u03b4-cover sampling, which was considered to be impractical [1, 2]. Our approach eliminates both requirements and achieves an exponential convergence rate.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kenji Kawaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawaguchi:Kenji", "Leslie Pack Kaelbling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaelbling:Leslie_Pack", "Tom\u00e1s Lozano-P\u00e9rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lozano=P=eacute=rez:Tom=aacute=s"], "pages": 9}
