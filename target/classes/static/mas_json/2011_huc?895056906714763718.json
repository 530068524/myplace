{"title": "Communication around home-energy monitoring devices: connecting stakeholders in low-income communities.", "fields": ["energy conservation", "social computing", "energy consumption", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "Prior research results show that comparison as a feedback technique can encourage additional savings; however, a limited number of home-energy studies explore social communication around feedback devices. We will develop a system that supports comparison and cross-household communication, and provides energy-use information. We will then deploy our system across 50 mixed-income renters. Our expected contributions include an interactive system for supporting comparison and collaboration; a better understanding of the conditions that motivate or discourage energy conservative behaviors for individuals that pay and do not pay for their electricity; and design recommendations for visualizations that allow comparison and collaboration across households.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Tawanna Dillahunt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillahunt:Tawanna"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
