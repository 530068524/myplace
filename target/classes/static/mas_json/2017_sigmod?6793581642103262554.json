{"title": "Distributed Algorithms on Exact Personalized PageRank.", "fields": ["load balancing", "bounded function", "pagerank", "scalability", "graph partition"], "abstract": "As one of the most well known graph computation problems,  Personalized PageRank  is an effective approach for computing the similarity score between two nodes, and it has been widely used in various applications, such as link prediction and recommendation. Due to the high computational cost and space cost of computing the exact Personalized PageRank Vector (PPV), most existing studies compute PPV approximately. In this paper, we propose novel and efficient distributed algorithms that compute PPV exactly based on graph partitioning on a general coordinator-based share-nothing distributed computing platform. Our algorithms takes three aspects into account: the load balance, the communication cost, and the computation cost of each machine. The proposed algorithms only require one time of communication between each machine and the coordinator at query time. The communication cost is bounded, and the work load on each machine is balanced. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and the scalability of our proposed methods.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "University of New South Wales", "Nanyang Technological University", "University of Helsinki", "University of New South Wales"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Tao Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Tao", "Xin Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xin", "Gao Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Gao", "Jiaheng Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Jiaheng", "Xuemin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xuemin"], "pages": 16}
