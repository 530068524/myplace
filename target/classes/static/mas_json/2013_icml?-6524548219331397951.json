All these algorithms aim to obtain coherent biclusters and it is crucial to have a reliable procedure for their validation. We point out the problem of size bias in biclustering evaluation and show how it can lead to wrong conclusions in a comparative study. We present the theoretical corrections for all of the most popular measures in order to remove this bias. We introduce the corrected precision-recall space that combines the advantages of corrected measures, the ease of interpretation and visualization of uncorrected measures. Numerical experiments demonstrate the interest of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Paris Descartes University", "Paris Descartes University"], "authors": ["Blaise Hanczar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanczar:Blaise", "Mohamed Nadif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nadif:Mohamed"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
