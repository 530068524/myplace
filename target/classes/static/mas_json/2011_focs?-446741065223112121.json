Previously, the fastest algorithms known for this problem were those for general graphs.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Brown University", "Brown University", "Tel Aviv University", "University of Southern Denmark"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Glencora Borradaile.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borradaile:Glencora", "Philip N.
