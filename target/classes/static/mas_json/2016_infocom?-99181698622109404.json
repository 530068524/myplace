{"title": "Shadowing and coverage in poisson buildings.", "fields": ["spectral efficiency", "point process", "euclidean space", "phenomenon", "path loss"], "abstract": "The Poisson building features a Poisson collection of random planes orthogonal to the axes of the 3-D Euclidean space. It divides the space into rectangular rooms of random sizes. The addition of wireless small cell base stations, deployed as Poisson point processes along the ceiling and corner lines of these rooms, provides a first stochastic geometric model representing in-building 3-D wireless networks. The main challenge for analyzing interference in such an environment is the fact that electromagnetic signals originating from different locations are blocked by common obstacles like walls and floors, which makes the path loss highly correlated in space. We propose a natural propagation model taking this phenomenon into account. We give analytical expressions for the interference field and its correlation within this framework. We illustrate the tractability of this model by providing analytical expressions for the spectral efficiency of the downlink in such indoor cellular networks and for D2D communications in such an environment. We combine the model and spatial simulations to show that classical 2-D and distance based attenuation models cannot be used in this context and to argue for the need of such 3-D models to assess the performance of this type of indoor communications.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Junse Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Junse", "Xinchen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xinchen", "Fran\u00e7ois Baccelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baccelli:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
