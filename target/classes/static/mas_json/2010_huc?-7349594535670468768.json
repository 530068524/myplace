{"title": "Sketching with strangers: in the wild study of ad hoc social communication by drawing.", "fields": ["conversation", "systems design", "multimedia", "flow", "channel"], "abstract": "We describe an in-the-wild experiment with non-verbal ad-hoc communication between strangers. We connected two night clubs via two interactive tables that allowed people at each end interact via shared drawings, pre-made symbols and actions. We interviewed 50 and observed approximately 200 participants. In local interaction, collaboration was the preferred mode of use, whereas with remote interaction, communication prevailed. This study demonstrated that people have such a strong desire to communicate that they are willing to forgive many imperfections in the channel. It was also evident that people resorted to stereotypical information to ease the rapid flow of conversation, when they had only limited knowledge of the other party (just the place). This paper describes our system design, the user study, and discusses implications on designing for ad hoc communication and context sharing in urban everyday environment.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia"], "authors": ["Panu M. \u00c5kerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Aring=kerman:Panu_M=", "Arto Puikkonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Puikkonen:Arto", "Pertti Huuskonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huuskonen:Pertti", "Antti Virolainen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Virolainen:Antti", "Jonna H\u00e4kkil\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=kkil=auml=:Jonna"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
