Recently, Guimbretiere et al. [1] demonstrated that such helper cores can also be used to execute simple user interface tasks. We revisit this approach by implementing a similar system on an off-the-shelf application processor (TI OMAP4). Our study shows that in the case of high event rate interactions (pen inking and virtual keyboard), significant battery life gains (\u00d71.7 and \u00d72.3 respectively) can be achieved with the helper core executing the interface. Having the helper core only dis-patch input events incurs a 18% penalty relative to the maximum savings rate, but allows for simplified deployment since it merely requires a change in toolkit infrastructure.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jaeyeon Kihm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kihm:Jaeyeon", "Fran\u00e7ois Guimbreti\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guimbreti=egrave=re:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Julia Karl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karl:Julia", "Rajit Manohar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manohar:Rajit"], "pages": 4}
