We introduce a phone-based application that allows a small group of collocated people to share photos using the metaphor of passing paper photos around. The prototype encourages people to share their devices and use them interchangeably while discussing photos face-to-face. The prototype supports ad-hoc photo sharing in different contexts by taking into account the spatial arrangement of users around a table, measured with sensors embedded in their mobile phones. Our evaluations show that people are willing to share and connect their mobile phones to engage in collaborative interactions. Participants were able to easily share their collections of photos using our proposed interaction techniques.", "citation": "Citations (153)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9s Lucero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucero:Andr=eacute=s", "Jussi Holopainen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holopainen:Jussi", "Tero Jokela.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jokela:Tero"], "pages": 10}
