{"title": "Flexible array of inexpensive radios.", "fields": ["radio frequency engineering", "remote radio head", "beamforming", "mimo", "cognitive radio"], "abstract": "In this demo, we propose to use multiple inexpensive off-the-shelf radios to build the FAIR system that can be flexibly configured to realize (1) non-contiguous spectrum access (2) MIMO and beamforming (3) constructing wider-band radio. While non-contiguous spectrum access and MIMO/beamforming are naturally supported by the FAIR system, we further develop radio bonding technique for constructing wider-band radio. Radio bonding provides a cost effective alternative to proprietory radio development that it can realize a non-existing wider-band radio using multiple commodity narrower-band radios. We demonstrate FAIR and radio bonding based on Sora 2.0.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jiansong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jiansong", "Kun Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kun"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
