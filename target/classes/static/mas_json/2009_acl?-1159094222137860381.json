{"title": "Linefeed Insertion into Japanese Spoken Monologue for Captioning.", "fields": ["speech recognition", "closed captioning", "natural language processing", "artificial intelligence", "sentence"], "abstract": "To support the real-time understanding of spoken monologue such as lectures and commentaries, the development of a captioning system is required. In monologues, since a sentence tends to be long, each sentence is often displayed in multi lines on one screen, it is necessary to insert linefeeds into a text so that the text becomes easy to read. This paper proposes a technique for inserting linefeeds into a Japanese spoken monologue text as an elemental technique to generate the readable captions. Our method appropriately inserts linefeeds into a sentence by machine learning, based on the information such as dependencies, clause boundaries, pauses and line length. An experiment using Japanese speech data has shown the effectiveness of our technique.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Nagoya University", "Nagoya University", "Nagoya University"], "authors": ["Tomohiro Ohno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohno:Tomohiro", "Masaki Murata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murata:Masaki", "Shigeki Matsubara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsubara:Shigeki"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
