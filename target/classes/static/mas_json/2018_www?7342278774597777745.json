{"title": "VizByWiki: Mining Data Visualizations from the Web to Enrich News Articles.", "fields": ["data type", "peer production", "ground truth", "data visualization", "user generated content"], "abstract": "Data visualizations in news articles (e.g. maps, line graphs, bar charts) greatly enrich the content of these articles and produce well-established improvements to reader comprehension. However, existing systems that generate news data visualizations either require substantial manual effort or are limited to very specific types of data visualizations, thereby greatly restricting the number of news articles that can be enhanced with visualizations. To address this issue, we define a new problem: given a news article, retrieve relevant visualizations that already exist on the web. We show that this problem is tractable through a new system \u2013 VizByWiki \u2013 that mines contextually relevant data visualizations from Wikimedia Commons, the central file repository for Wikipedia. Using a novel ground truth dataset, we show that VizByWiki is able to retrieve at least one relevant data visualization for as many as 48% of popular online news articles. We also demonstrate that VizByWiki can automatically rank visualizations according to their usefulness with reasonable ranking quality (nDCG@5 of 0.82). To facilitate further advances on the news visualization retrieval problem, we release our ground truth dataset and make our system and its source code publicly available.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "University of Minnesota", "University of Michigan", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Allen Yilun Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Allen_Yilun", "Joshua Ford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ford:Joshua", "Eytan Adar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adar:Eytan", "Brent J.
