It employs Cournot and Bertrand games to model competition among service providers and network providers, respectively, and develops a novel unified model to capture the interaction and competition among these players in a \"service-oriented\" Internet. Incentives for service and network innovation are studied in this model.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Zhi-Li Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhi=Li", "Papak Nabipay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nabipay:Papak", "Andrew M.
