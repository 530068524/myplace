In the new NFV market, well defined VNF instances each realize an atomic function that can be chained to meet user demands in practice. This work studies the dynamic market mechanism design for the transaction of VNF service chains in the NFV market, to help relinquish the full power of NFV. Combining the techniques of primal-dual approximation algorithm design with Myerson's characterization of truthful mechanisms, we design a VNF chain auction that runs efficiently in polynomial time, guarantees truthfulness, and achieves near-optimal social welfare in the NFV eco-system. Extensive simulation studies verify the efficacy of our auction mechanism.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Wuhan University", "Wuhan University", "University of Hong Kong", "Wuhan University"], "authors": ["Sijia Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Sijia", "Zongpeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zongpeng", "Chuan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Chuan", "Chuanhe Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chuanhe"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
