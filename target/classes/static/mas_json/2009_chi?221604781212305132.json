Our research suggests incorporating sacred imagery into techno-spiritual applications can be useful in guiding development. We illustrate this through the design and evaluation of a mobile phone application developed to support Islamic prayer practices. Our contribution is to show how religious imagery can be used in the design of applications that go beyond the provision of functionality to connect people to the experience of religion.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Washington", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Susan Wyche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wyche:Susan", "Kelly E.
