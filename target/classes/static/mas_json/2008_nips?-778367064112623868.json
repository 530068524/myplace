While the method is based on Markov chains, estimates based on short runs are formally unbiased. In expectation, the log probability of a test set will be underestimated, and this could form the basis of a probabilistic bound. The method is much cheaper than gold-standard annealing-based methods and only slightly more expensive than the cheapest Monte Carlo methods. We give examples of the new method substantially improving simple variational bounds at modest extra cost.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Iain Murray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murray_0001:Iain", "Ruslan Salakhutdinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salakhutdinov:Ruslan"], "pages": 8}
