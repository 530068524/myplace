We use the server-side web parsing and rendering to leverage the browser computing logic. We use a composite screen format to represent the display of the web content, incorporating the web background screen and the dynamic web objects. And then we employ a slice-based screen encoding scheme to efficiently compress the web background screen. Besides the display screen of the web content, we also send the side information of the web objects to enable the designed object-level interaction mechanisms. The experimental results show that our browser can achieve the superior browsing speed, compared with the native browser and yield much better visual quality than the existing proxy-based browser", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Huifeng Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Huifeng", "Zhaotai Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Zhaotai", "Haicheng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Haicheng", "Yan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0001:Yan", "Shipeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shipeng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
