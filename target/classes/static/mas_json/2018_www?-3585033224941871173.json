A new recruiting and validation method allows us to create a panel of eligible experiment participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Using this panel, we ran three different crowdsourced VR experiments, each reproducing one of three VR illusions: place illusion, embodiment illusion, and plausibility illusion. Our experience and worker feedback on these experiments show that conducting Web-based VR experiments using crowdsourcing is already feasible, though some challenges\u2013including scale\u2013remain. Such crowdsourced VR experiments on the Web have the potential to finally support replicable VR experiments with diverse populations at a low cost.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Xiao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiao", "Megan Cackett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cackett:Megan", "Leslie Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Leslie", "Eric Chien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chien:Eric", "Mor Naaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naaman:Mor"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
