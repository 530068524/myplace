It encompasses two classical combinatorial optimization problems - vehicle routing and resource constrained scheduling. We present an effective hybrid algorithm to dynamically manage the movement of convoys, where we combine the standard Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm with constraint programming techniques. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated with testing on varying problem sizes and complexity.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Singapore Management University"], "authors": ["Ramesh Thangarajoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thangarajoo:Ramesh", "Lucas Agussurja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agussurja:Lucas", "Hoong Chuin Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Hoong_Chuin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 7}
