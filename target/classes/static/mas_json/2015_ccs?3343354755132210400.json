{"title": "HORNET: High-speed Onion Routing at the Network Layer.", "fields": ["symmetric key algorithm", "network layer", "network architecture", "onion routing", "scalability"], "abstract": "We present HORNET, a system that enables high-speed end-to-end anonymous channels by leveraging next-generation network architectures. HORNET is designed as a low-latency onion routing system that operates at the network layer thus enabling a wide range of applications. Our system uses only symmetric cryptography for data forwarding yet requires no per-flow state on intermediate routers. This design enables HORNET routers implemented on off-the-shelf hardware to process anonymous traffic at over 93 Gb/s. HORNET is also highly scalable, adding minimal processing overhead per additional anonymous channel.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "University College London", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Chen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0013:Chen", "Daniele Enrico Asoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asoni:Daniele_Enrico", "David Barrera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barrera:David", "George Danezis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danezis:George", "Adrian Perrig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perrig:Adrian"], "pages": 14}
