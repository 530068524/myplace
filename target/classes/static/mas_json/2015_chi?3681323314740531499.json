While these approaches have been shown to mitigate the negative effects of stress, they can be difficult to learn or consistently apply. To support these techniques, we developed MoodLight, a playful system that uses ambient colored light to provide feedback regarding an individual's current arousal levels. Like many affective computing systems, MoodLight was designed to help users observe their internal state and learn to relax. However, our findings indicate that prompting or leading feedback can be more effective than real time feedback in helping users relax. This work contributes to affective computing by suggesting alternative approaches to designing biofeedback systems for stress management.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mark Matthews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthews:Mark", "Jaime Snyder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snyder:Jaime", "Lindsay Reynolds.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reynolds:Lindsay", "Jacqueline T.
