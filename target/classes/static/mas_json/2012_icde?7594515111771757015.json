{"title": "Discovering Multiple Clustering Solutions: Grouping Objects in Different Views of the Data.", "fields": ["complex data type", "set theory", "clustering high dimensional data", "scalability", "machine learning", "data mining", "cluster analysis"], "abstract": "Traditional clustering algorithms identify just a single clustering of the data. Today's complex data, however, allow multiple interpretations leading to several valid groupings hidden in different views of the database. Each of these multiple clustering solutions is valuable and interesting as different perspectives on the same data and several meaningful groupings for each object are given. Especially for high dimensional data where each object is described by multiple attributes, alternative clusters in different attribute subsets are of major interest. In this tutorial, we describe several real world application scenarios for multiple clustering solutions. We abstract from these scenarios and provide the general challenges in this emerging research area. We describe state-of-the-art paradigms, we highlight specific techniques, and we give an overview of this topic by providing a taxonomy of the existing methods. By focusing on open challenges, we try to attract young researchers for participating in this emerging research field.", "citation": "Citations (47)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Emmanuel M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Emmanuel", "Stephan G\u00fcnnemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=uuml=nnemann:Stephan", "Ines F\u00e4rber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/F=auml=rber:Ines", "Thomas Seidl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidl_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
