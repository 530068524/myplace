While temporal event detection has been extensively studied, early detection is a relatively unexplored problem. This paper proposes a maximum-margin framework for training temporal event detectors to recognize partial events, enabling early detection. Our method is based on Structured Output SVM, but extends it to accommodate sequential data. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity, for detecting facial expressions, hand gestures, and human activities, demonstrate the benefits of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (239)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Minh Hoai Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Minh_Hoai", "Fernando De la Torre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torre:Fernando_De_la"], "pages": 8}
