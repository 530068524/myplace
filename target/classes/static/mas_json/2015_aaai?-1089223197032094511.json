I present the approach taken to reduce the complexity of the activity-planning task in order to perform it effectively under the time pressures imposed by the mission requirements. One key aspect of this approach is the design of the activity planning process based on principles of problem decomposition and planning abstraction levels. The second key aspect is the mixed-initiative system developed for this task, called LASS (LADEE Activity Scheduling System). The primary challenge for LASS was representing and managing the science constraints that were tied to key points in the spacecraft\u2019s orbit, given their dynamic nature due to the continually updated orbit determination solution.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Ames Research Center", "Ames Research Center"], "authors": ["John L.
