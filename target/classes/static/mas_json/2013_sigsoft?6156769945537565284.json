{"title": "Automatically describing software faults.", "fields": ["debugging", "latent semantic analysis", "comprehension", "software fault tolerance", "automation"], "abstract": "A developers ability to successfully debug a fault is directly related to their ability to comprehend the fault. Notwithstanding improvements in software-maintenance automation, this fault comprehension task remains largely manual and time consuming. I propose an automated approach to describe software faults, thus ameliorating comprehension and reducing manual effort. My approach leverages dynamic analysis, fault localization, and source-code mining to produce a succinct, natural-language fault summary.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Nicholas DiGiuseppe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DiGiuseppe:Nicholas"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
