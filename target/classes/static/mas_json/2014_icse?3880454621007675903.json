After clustering Android apps by their description topics, we identify outliers in each cluster with respect to their API usage. A \"weather\" app that sends messages thus becomes an anomaly; likewise, a \"messaging\" app would typically not be expected to access the current location. Applied on a set of 22,500+ Android applications, our CHABADA prototype identified several anomalies; additionally, it flagged 56% of novel malware as such, without requiring any known malware patterns.", "citation": "Citations (246)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "authors": ["Alessandra Gorla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorla:Alessandra", "Ilaria Tavecchia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tavecchia:Ilaria", "Florian Gross.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gross:Florian", "Andreas Zeller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeller:Andreas"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
