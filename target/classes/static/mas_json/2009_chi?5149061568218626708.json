{"title": "Reflections of everyday activities in spending data.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "human computer interaction", "computer science"], "abstract": "In this paper we show that financial information can be used to sense many aspects of human activity. This simple technique gives people information about their daily lives, is easily accessible to many at no extra cost, requires little setup, and does not require the manufacture of any external devices. We will focus on how financial data can be used to show users where they spend their time, when they accomplish certain habits, and what the impact of their activities is on the environment. We validate our idea by implementing three demonstration applications intended for personal use. Finally, this paper discusses limitations of sensing using financial data and possible solutions.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Julia Schwarz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwarz:Julia", "Jennifer Mankoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mankoff:Jennifer", "H.
