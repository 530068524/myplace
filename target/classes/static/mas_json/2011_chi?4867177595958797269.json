However, for some end-users these examples may be unusable. An example is unusable if a user cannot select the code in the example that corresponds to their interests. Research suggests that non-programmers struggle to correctly select the code responsible for interesting output functionality. In this paper we present Dinah: an interface to support non-programmers with selecting code causing graphical output. Dinah assists non-programmers by providing concurrency support and in-context affordances for statement replay and temporally based navigation.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "University of Washington", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Paul A.
