In this paper we are concerned with a specific community that has formed around free food sharing to save food from being wasted. Specifically, Foodsharing.de is a platform that enables consumers, farmers, organizations and retailers to offer and collect food. Associated with this is the Foodsharing Facebook group where broader community discussions take place. We report on a qualitative analysis of the Foodsharing Facebook group to understand its role in emerging and sustaining the community. The Facebook group is a place where the individual values and motives, socio-political discussions and mass media interrelate and create new social patterns through narratives and local community building. We present our findings as interplay between individual, community, organisational levels, public relations and media, the operational platform Foodsharing.de that enables local communities and the Facebook group where global ideological framing of the community takes place.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Eva Ganglbauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganglbauer:Eva", "Geraldine Fitzpatrick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fitzpatrick:Geraldine", "\u00d6zge Subasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subasi:=Ouml=zge", "Florian G\u00fcldenpfennig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=uuml=ldenpfennig:Florian"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
