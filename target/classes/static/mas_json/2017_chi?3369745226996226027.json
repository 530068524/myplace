{"title": "Finding the Right Fit: Understanding Health Tracking in Workplace Wellness Programs.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "confusion", "personal life", "computer science", "workplace wellness"], "abstract": "Workplace health and wellness programs are increasingly integrating personal health tracking technologies, such as Fitbit and Apple Watch. Many question whether these technologies truly support employees in their pursuit of better wellness levels, raising objections about workplace surveillance and further blurring of boundaries between work and personal life. We conducted a study to understand how tracking tools are adopted in wellness programs and employees' opinions about these programs. We find that employees are generally positive about incentivized health tracking in the workplace, as it helps raise awareness of activity levels. However, there is a gap between the intentions of the programs and individual experiences and health goals. This sometimes results in confusion and creates barriers to participation. Even if this gap can be addressed, health tracking in the workplace will not be for everyone; this has implications for the design of both workplace wellness programs and tracking technologies.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "IT University of Copenhagen", "IT University of Copenhagen", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chia-Fang Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Chia=Fang", "Nanna Jensen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jensen:Nanna", "Irina A.
