The wide input space is leveraged for a horizontal spatial mapping of quickly accessible information and applications. We discuss social implications and interaction capabilities for unobtrusive touch input and present our hardware implementation and a set of applications that benefit from the quick access time. In a qualitative user study with 14 participants we found out that for short interactions (2-4 seconds), most of the surface area is considered as appropriate input space, while for longer interactions (up to 10 seconds), the front areas above the trouser pockets are preferred.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "University of Ulm"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David Dobbelstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobbelstein:David", "Philipp Hock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hock:Philipp", "Enrico Rukzio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rukzio:Enrico"], "pages": 4}
