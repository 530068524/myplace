An important assumption of DBN structure learning is that the data are generated by a stationary process\u2014an assumption that is not true in many important settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of graphical models called non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks, in which the conditional dependence structure of the underlying data-generation process is permitted to change over time. Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks represent a new framework for studying problems in which the structure of a network is evolving over time. We define the non-stationary DBN model, present an MCMC sampling algorithm for learning the structure of the model from time-series data under different assumptions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both simulated and biological data.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Joshua W.
