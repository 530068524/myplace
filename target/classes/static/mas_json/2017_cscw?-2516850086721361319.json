{"title": "Fruitful Feedback: Positive Affective Language and Source Anonymity Improve Critique Reception and Work Outcomes.", "fields": ["annoyance", "affect", "peer feedback", "frustration", "anonymity"], "abstract": "Feedback is information that can improve task performance. Online communities, educational forums, and crowd-based feedback platforms all support feedback exchange among a more diverse set of sources than ever before, with greater control over how to moderate this exchange. In this work, we study how the power relationship between the source and receiver and the tone of language influence the recep-tivity, effort, and work performance resulting from online feedback exchange. We conducted an online experiment manipulating affective language and source of feedback on a writing task. We found that critiques with positive affec-tive language increased positive emotions and reduced participants' annoyance and frustration, which led to an increase in work quality, compared to critiques without positive language. Feedback without positive affective language led to more edits, but not better work outcomes. Participants reacted more positively to feedback from an anonymous source than from a peer or an authority. Our findings provide design implications for platforms to support more fruitful feedback exchange.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Duyen T.
