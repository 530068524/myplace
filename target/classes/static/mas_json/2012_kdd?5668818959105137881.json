While the existing CVB inference for the HDP variant of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is more complicated and harder to implement than that for LDA, the proposed algorithm is simple to implement, does not require variance counts to be maintained, does not need to set hyper-parameters, and has good predictive performance.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Google", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Issei Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Issei", "Kenichi Kurihara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurihara:Kenichi", "Hiroshi Nakagawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakagawa:Hiroshi"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
