The algorithm, named Persistent Contrastive Divergence, is different from the standard Contrastive Divergence algorithms in that it aims to draw samples from almost exactly the model distribution. It is compared to some standard Contrastive Divergence and Pseudo-Likelihood algorithms on the tasks of modeling and classifying various types of data. The Persistent Contrastive Divergence algorithm outperforms the other algorithms, and is equally fast and simple.", "citation": "Citations (702)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Toronto"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Tijmen Tieleman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tieleman:Tijmen"], "pages": 8}
