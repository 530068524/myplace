We propagate the segmentation labels at the previous frame to the current frame using optical flow vectors. However, the propagation is error-prone. Therefore, we develop the convolutional trident network (CTN), which has three decoding branches: separative, definite foreground, and definite background decoders. Then, we perform Markov random field optimization based on outputs of the three decoders. We sequentially carry out these processes from the second to the last frames to extract a segment track of the target object. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art conventional algorithms on the DAVIS benchmark dataset.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Korea University", "School of Elect ... cal Engineering"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Won-Dong Jang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jang:Won=Dong", "Chang-Su Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Chang=Su"], "pages": 10}
