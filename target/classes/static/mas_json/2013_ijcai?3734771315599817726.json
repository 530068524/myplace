Current algorithms search through the space of full histories for each agent. Because of the doubly exponential growth in the number of policies in this space as the planning horizon increases, these methods quickly become intractable. However, in real world problems, computing policies over the full history space is often unnecessary. True histories experienced by the agents often lie near a structured, low-dimensional manifold embedded into the history space. We show that by transforming a Dec-POMDP into a continuous-state MDP, we are able to find and exploit these low-dimensional representations. Using this novel transformation, we can then apply powerful techniques for solving POMDPs and continuous-state MDPs. By combining a general search algorithm and dimension reduction based on feature selection, we introduce a novel approach to optimally solve problems with significantly longer planning horizons than previous methods.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Lorraine", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Lorraine", "University of Lorraine", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of New Hampshire", "University of Lorraine", "University of Lorraine"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jilles Steeve Dibangoye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dibangoye:Jilles_Steeve", "Christopher Amato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amato:Christopher", "Olivier Buffet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buffet:Olivier", "Fran\u00e7ois Charpillet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charpillet:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 7}
