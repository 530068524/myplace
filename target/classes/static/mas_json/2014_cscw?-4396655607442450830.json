We study how this large and complex infrastructure for issuing unique biometric-based identification numbers to the 1.2 billion residents of India was aligned across various stakeholders engaged in the project. We find that the focus on 'data' kept the entire infrastructure together and working. However, this narrow focus also made the design team view the people applying for IDs as numbers whose management could be standardized. In reality, the infrastructure encountered people with differing experiences and expectations of state-issued IDs, expectations that had to be managed by agents on the ground. With our focus on the nation state as a site for studying e-infrastructure, we extend the domains in which CSCW research takes place and contribute to the theory of infrastructure building in a context where state-citizen relations are at stake.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["George Mason University", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Aditya Johri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johri:Aditya", "Janaki Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Janaki"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 13}
