Recently, investigations of referential behaviours involved in situations in the real world have received increasing attention by researchers (Di Eugenio et al., 2000; Byron, 2005; van Deemter, 2007; Spanger et al., 2009). In order to create an accurate reference resolution model, we need to handle extra-linguistic information as well as textual information examined by existing approaches (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002, etc.). In this paper, we incorporate extra-linguistic information into an existing corpus-based reference resolution model, and investigate its effects on reference resolution problems within a corpus of Japanese dialogues. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 79.0% for this task.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ryu Iida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iida:Ryu", "Syumpei Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Syumpei", "Takenobu Tokunaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tokunaga:Takenobu"], "pages": 9}
