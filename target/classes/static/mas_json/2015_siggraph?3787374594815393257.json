We demonstrate a framework for the Samsung Gear VR headset that allows developers to create a totally immersive AR & VR experience with no need for interfacing with external devices or cables thereby making it a truly autonomous mobile VR experience. The significant benefits of this system over existing ones are - a fully hands free experience where hands could be used for gesture based input, the ability to use the Head Mounted Display (HMD) sensor for improved head and positional tracking and automatic peer to peer network creation for communication between phones. The most important factor in our system is to provide an intuitive way to interact with virtual objects in AR and VR. And users should be able to switch from AR to VR world and vice versa seamlessly.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung"], "authors": ["Prashanth Bollam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bollam:Prashanth", "Eesha Gothwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gothwal:Eesha", "G.
