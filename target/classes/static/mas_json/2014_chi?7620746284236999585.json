Our understanding of how these technologies match the experiences with smell that people have or want to have is surprisingly limited. We therefore investigated the experience of smell and the emotions that accompany it. We collected stories from 439 participants who described personally memorable smell experiences in an online questionnaire. Based on the stories we developed 10 categories of smell experience. We explored the implications of the categories for smell-enhanced technology design by (a) probing participants to envision technologies that match their smell story and (b) having HCI researchers brainstorm technologies using the categories as design stimuli. We discuss how our findings can benefit research on personal memories, momentary and first time experiences, and wellbeing.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Sussex", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Marianna Obrist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Obrist:Marianna", "Alexandre N.
