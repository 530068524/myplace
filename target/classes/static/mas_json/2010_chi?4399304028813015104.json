{"title": "I don't mind being logged, but want to remain in control: a field study of mobile activity and context logging.", "fields": ["user experience design", "logging", "mobile phone", "private information retrieval", "lifelog"], "abstract": "People have a natural tendency to capture and share their experiences via stories, photos and other mementos. As users are increasingly carrying the enabling devices with them, capturing life events is becoming more spontaneous. The automatic and persistent collecting of information about one's life and behavior is called lifelogging. Lifelogging relieves the user from manually capturing events but also poses many challenges from the user's perspective. We conducted a field study to explore the user experience of mobile phone activity and context logging, a technically feasible form of lifelogging. Our results indicate that users quickly stop to pay attention to the logging, but they want to be in control of logging the most private information. Although logging personal content, such as text messages, is experienced as a possible privacy threat, browsing the content and getting insight to the revealed life patterns was considered interesting and fun.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Tampere University of Technology", "Nokia", "Tampere University of Technology"], "authors": ["Tuula K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=auml=rkk=auml=inen:Tuula", "Tuomas Vaittinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaittinen:Tuomas", "Kaisa V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen-Vainio-Mattila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/V=auml==auml=n=auml=nen=Vainio=Mattila:Kaisa"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
