{"title": "Designing graphical menus for novices and experts: connecting design characteristics with design goals.", "fields": ["design education", "human computer interaction", "multimedia", "structured analysis", "strengths and weaknesses"], "abstract": "This paper presents a design space for graphical menus. We model the design space as a set of design goals, a set of design characteristics, and connections between the two. The design goals are based on novice and expert behaviors. The connections link the choices for design characteristics with the positive or negative effects that these choices have on the design goals. The paper further synthesizes the design space into a succinct form of structured design recommendations. A case study demonstrates how these recommendations can be used to assess and compare the strengths and weaknesses of two menu designs.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["National University of Ireland, Galway"], "authors": ["Krystian Samp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samp:Krystian"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
