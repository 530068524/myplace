{"title": "Convex Multiple-Instance Learning by Estimating Likelihood Ratio.", "fields": ["restricted maximum likelihood", "likelihood principle", "linear classifier", "maximum likelihood sequence estimation", "marginal likelihood"], "abstract": "We propose an approach to multiple-instance learning that reformulates the problem as a convex optimization on the likelihood ratio between the positive and the negative class for each training instance. This is casted as joint estimation of both a likelihood ratio predictor and the target (likelihood ratio variable) for instances. Theoretically, we prove a quantitative relationship between the risk estimated under the 0-1 classification loss, and under a loss function for likelihood ratio. It is shown that likelihood ratio estimation is generally a good surrogate for the 0-1 loss, and separates positive and negative instances well. The likelihood ratio estimates provide a ranking of instances within a bag and are used as input features to learn a linear classifier on bags of instances. Instance-level classification is achieved from the bag-level predictions and the individual likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["University of Bonn", "University of Bonn"], "authors": ["Fuxin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Fuxin", "Cristian Sminchisescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sminchisescu:Cristian"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
