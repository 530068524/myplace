Existing function call predictions are mainly built on statistical patterns, suitable for predicting a single call but not a sequence of calls. This paper presents a new way to enable call sequence prediction, which exploits program structures through Probabilistic Calling Automata (PCA), a new program representation that captures both the inherent ensuing relations among function calls, and the probabilistic nature of execution paths. It shows that PCA-based prediction outperforms existing predictions, yielding substantial speedup when being applied to guide Just-In-Time compilation. By enabling accurate, efficient call sequence prediction for the first time, PCA-based predictors open up many new opportunities for dynamic program optimizations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "Colorado School of Mines", "College of William & Mary", "North Carolina State University", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Zhijia Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Zhijia", "Bo Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0002:Bo", "Mingzhou Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Mingzhou", "Yufei Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Yufei", "Jianhua Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jianhua", "Xipeng Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xipeng", "Youfeng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Youfeng"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2014", "pages": 18}
