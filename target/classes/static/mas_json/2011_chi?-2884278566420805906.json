The activation energy calculated by both isothermal and non-isothermal treatments is 599 and 622\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol \u22121 , respectively. The growth morphology parameters  n  and  m  are both about 1.5 indicating that bulk nucleation is dominant in mullite crystallisation followed by three-dimensional growth of mullite crystals with polyhedron-like morphology controlled by diffusion from a constant number of nuclei. The frequency factor calculated by the isothermal treatment is equal to 8.21\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 22 \u00a0s \u22121 .", "citation": "Citations (96)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council", "Environment Canada", "Environment Canada", "Science Applications International Corporation", "University of Ottawa", "University of New Brunswick", "University of New Brunswick", "University of New Brunswick", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "Duke University", "Duke University", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Queen's University", "Queen's University", "ISL, 5 rue du G ... t-Louis, France", "ISL, 5 rue du G ... t-Louis, France"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Hyunjung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyunjung", "Woohun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Woohun"], "pages": 4}
