However, moving the address space from IP addresses to content names brings scalability issues to a whole new level, due to two reasons. First, name aggregation is not as trivial a task as the IP address aggregation in BGP routing. Second, the number of addressable contents in the Internet is several orders of magnitude higher than the number of IP addresses. With the current size of the Internet, name based, anycast routing is very challenging specially when routing efficiency is of prime importance. We propose a novel name-based routing scheme (\u03b1Route) for ICN that offers efficient bandwidth usage, guaranteed content lookup and scalable routing table size.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Reaz Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Reaz", "Md.
