{"title": "The lasso, persistence, and cross-validation.", "fields": ["cross validation", "applied research", "smoothing", "persistence", "lasso"], "abstract": "During the last fifteen years, the lasso procedure has been the target of a substantial amount of theoretical and applied research. Correspondingly, many results are known about its behavior for a fixed or optimally chosen smoothing parameter (given up to unknown constants). Much less, however, is known about the lasso's behavior when the smoothing parameter is chosen in a data dependent way. To this end, we give the first result about the risk consistency of lasso when the smoothing parameter is chosen via cross-validation. We consider the high-dimensional setting wherein the number of predictors p = n\u03b1, \u03b1 > 0 grows with the number of observations.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Colorado State University", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "authors": ["Darren Homrighausen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Homrighausen:Darren", "Daniel J.
