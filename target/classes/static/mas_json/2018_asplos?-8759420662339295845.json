{"title": "Statistical Reconstruction of Class Hierarchies in Binaries.", "fields": ["language model", "pairwise comparison", "subclass", "class hierarchy", "binary number"], "abstract": "We address a fundamental problem in reverse engineering of object-oriented code: the reconstruction of a program's class hierarchy from its  stripped  binary. Existing approaches rely heavily on  structural  information that is not always available, e.g., calls to parent constructors. As a result, these approaches often leave gaps in the hierarchies they construct, or fail to construct them altogether. Our main insight is that  behavioral  information can be used to infer subclass/superclass relations, supplementing any missing structural information. Thus, we propose the  first statistical approach  for static reconstruction of class hierarchies based on  behavioral similarity.  We capture the behavior of each type using a statistical language model (SLM), define a metric for  pairwise similarity  between types based on the  Kullback-Leibler divergence  between their SLMs, and lift it to determine the most likely class hierarchy. We implemented our approach in a tool called ROCK and used it to automatically reconstruct the class hierarchies of several real-world stripped C++ binaries. Our results demonstrate that ROCK obtained  significantly  more accurate class hierarchies than those obtained using structural analysis alone.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Tel Aviv University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Omer Katz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katz:Omer", "Noam Rinetzky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rinetzky:Noam", "Eran Yahav.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yahav:Eran"], "pages": 14}
