It discusses how the use of a board game may provide a) a safe research environment in which participants feel comfortable to share their thoughts and experiences in a group setting, and b) a tool to facilitate users to think about their needs regarding a future product. The use of the board game approach is illustrated by a case study in the context of developing a new train information system. The design of the board game that was used is described in detail, as well as how the game was used to elicit potential future experiences. A survey amongst the participants showed that the board game was appreciated as a surprising, pleasant and \"safe\" research method.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "iMinds", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "iMinds"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Karin Slegers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slegers:Karin", "Sanne Ruelens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruelens:Sanne", "Jorick Vissers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vissers:Jorick", "Pieter Duysburgh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duysburgh:Pieter"], "pages": 4}
