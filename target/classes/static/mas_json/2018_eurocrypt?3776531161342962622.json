Our end result shows that its mu security is comparable to that achieved in the single-user setting. In particular, even when instantiated with short keys (e.g., 128 bits), the security of \\(\\mathsf {AES\\text {-}GCM\\text {-}SIV}\\) is not impacted by the collisions of two user keys, as long as each individual nonce is not re-used by too many users. Our bounds also improve existing analyses in the single-user setting, in particular when messages of variable lengths are encrypted. We also validate security against a general class of key-derivation methods, including one that halves the complexity of the final proposal.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "Florida State University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Priyanka Bose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bose:Priyanka", "Viet Tung Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Viet_Tung", "Stefano Tessaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tessaro:Stefano"], "pages": 32}
