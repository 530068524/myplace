{"title": "Scaling-up Security Games with Boundedly Rational Adversaries: A Cutting-plane Approach.", "fields": ["adversary model", "cocomo", "adversary", "bounded rationality", "stackelberg competition"], "abstract": "To improve the current real-world deployments of Stackelberg security games (SSGs), it is critical now to efficiently incorporate models of adversary bounded rationality in large-scale SSGs. Unfortunately, previously proposed branch-and-price approaches fail to scale-up given the non-convexity of such models, as we show with a realization called COCOMO. Therefore, we next present a novel cutting-plane algorithm called BLADE to scale-up SSGs with complex adversary models, with three key novelties: (i) an efficient scalable separation oracle to generate deep cuts; (ii) a heuristic that uses gradient to further improve the cuts; (iii) techniques for quality-efficiency tradeoff.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Chile"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Rong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Rong", "Albert Xin Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Albert_Xin", "Milind Tambe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tambe:Milind", "Fernando Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ord=oacute==ntilde=ez:Fernando"], "pages": 7}
