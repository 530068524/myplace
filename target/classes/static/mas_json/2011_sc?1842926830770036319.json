{"title": "Improving communication performance in dense linear algebra via topology aware collectives.", "fields": ["cuboid", "linear algebra", "matrix multiplication", "lu decomposition", "massively parallel"], "abstract": "Recent results have shown that topology aware mapping reduces network contention in communication-intensive kernels on massively parallel machines. We demonstrate that on mesh interconnects, topology aware mapping also allows for the utilization of highly-efficient topology aware collectives. We map novel 2.5D dense linear algebra algorithms to exploit rectangular collectives on cuboid partitions allocated by a Blue Gene/P supercomputer. Our mappings allow the algorithms to exploit optimized line multicasts and reductions. Commonly used 2D algorithms cannot be mapped in this fashion. On 16,384 nodes (65,536 cores) of Blue Gene/P, 2.5D algorithms that exploit rectangular collectives are significantly faster than 2D matrix multiplication (MM) and LU factorization, up to 8.7x and 2.1x, respectively. These speed-ups are due to communication reduction (up to 95.6% for 2.5D MM with respect to 2D MM). We also derive LogP-based novel performance models for rectangular broadcasts and reductions. Using those, we model the performance of matrix multiplication and LU factorization on a hypothetical exascale architecture.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Edgar Solomonik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solomonik:Edgar", "Abhinav Bhatele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhatele:Abhinav", "James Demmel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demmel:James"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2011", "pages": 11}
