In order to leverage the information present in all the modalities, one must model the relationships between them. While some techniques have been proposed to tackle this problem, they either are restricted to words describing visual objects only, or require full correspondences between the different modalities. As a consequence, they are unable to tackle more realistic scenarios where a narrative text is only loosely related to an image, and where only a few image-text pairs are available. In this paper, we propose a model that addresses both these challenges. Our model can be seen as a Markov random field of topic models, which connects the documents based on their similarity. As a consequence, the topics learned with our model are shared across connected documents, thus encoding the relations between different modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for image retrieval from a loosely related text.", "citation": "Citations (156)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "TTI-Chicago, USA"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yangqing Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yangqing", "Mathieu Salzmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salzmann:Mathieu", "Trevor Darrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darrell:Trevor"], "pages": 8}
