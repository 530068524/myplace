In this paper we contribute to this understanding in two ways. We present a new theoretically tractable variant of random regression forests and prove that our algorithm is consistent. We also provide an empirical evaluation, comparing our algorithm and other theoretically tractable random forest models to the random forest algorithm used in practice. Our experiments provide insight into the relative importance of different simplifications that theoreticians have made to obtain tractable models for analysis.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of British Columbia", "University of Oxford", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Misha Denil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denil:Misha", "David Matheson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matheson:David", "Nando de Freitas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freitas:Nando_de"], "pages": 9}
