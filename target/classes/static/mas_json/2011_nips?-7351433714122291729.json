Although it has been proposed that these systems may dominate according to their relative statistical efficiency in different circumstances, there is little specific evidence \u2014 especially in humans \u2014 as to the details of this trade-off. Accordingly, we examine the relative performance of different RL approaches under situations in which the statistics of reward are differentially noisy and volatile. Using theory and simulation, we show that model-free TD learning is relatively most disadvantaged in cases of high volatility and low noise. We present data from a decision-making experiment manipulating these parameters, showing that humans shift learning strategies in accord with these predictions. The statistical circumstances favoring model-based RL are also those that promote a high learning rate, which helps explain why, in psychology, the distinction between these strategies is traditionally conceived in terms of rule-based vs. incremental learning.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["New York University", "Center for Neural Science"], "authors": ["Dylan A.
