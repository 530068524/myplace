A personal CG character is automatically generated by scanning one's face geometry and image in ICS. Voice is as essential to identify a person as face. However, a character's voice is only based on gender in ICS. We proposed a novel voice recording tool for participants of all ages in a short time. Post-recording tasks are very difficult because speakers should speak in synchronization with the mouth movements of the CG characters. Therefore this task is generally recorded by professional voice actors. Our proposed tool has the following four features: 1) various supporting information for synchronization with voice and mouth movement timing for users; 2) automatic post-processing of recorded voices for compositing mixed audio; 3) intuitively displays operation for people of all ages; and 4) handles multiple users in parallel for quick recording. We developed a prototype speech synchronization system using a post-recording tool and conducted subjective evaluation experiments of it. Over 60% of the subjects responded that the tool's interface can be operated easily.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Waseda University", "ATR Spoken Lang ... s, Kyoto, Japan", "ATR Spoken Lang ... s, Kyoto, Japan", "ATR Spoken Lang ... s, Kyoto, Japan"], "authors": ["Shinichi Kawamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawamoto:Shinichi", "Tatsuo Yotsukura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yotsukura:Tatsuo", "Shigeo Morishima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morishima:Shigeo", "Satoshi Nakamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakamura_0001:Satoshi"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
