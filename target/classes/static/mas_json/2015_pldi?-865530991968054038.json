{"title": "Asynchronous programming, analysis and testing with state machines.", "fields": ["declarative programming", "concurrent object oriented programming", "asynchronous communication", "assertion", "concurrency"], "abstract": "Programming efficient asynchronous systems is challenging because it can often be hard to express the design declaratively, or to defend against data races and interleaving-dependent assertion violations. Previous work has only addressed these challenges in isolation, by either designing a new declarative language, a new data race detection tool or a new testing technique. We present P#, a language for high-reliability asynchronous programming co-designed with a static data race analysis and systematic concurrency testing infrastructure. We describe our experience using P# to write several distributed protocols and port an industrial-scale system internal to Microsoft, showing that the combined techniques, by leveraging the design of P#, are effective in finding bugs.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Microsoft", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Pantazis Deligiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deligiannis:Pantazis", "Alastair F.
