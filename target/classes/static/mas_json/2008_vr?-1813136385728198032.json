Some existing AR systems have demonstrated how to dynamically estimate registration errors based on estimates of spatial errors in the system. Using these error estimates, these systems also demonstrated a number of ways of ameliorating the effects of registration error. One central part of this previous work was the creation and use of error regions around objects; unfortunately, the analytic methods used only created accurate regions for simple convex objects. In this paper, we present a simple and stable algorithm for generating the uncertainty regions for complex objects, including non-convex objects and objects with interior holes. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to create a set of more accurate error-based highlights in the presence of registration error, and also be used as a general highlighting mechanism.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jiajian Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiajian", "Blair MacIntyre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/MacIntyre:Blair"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
