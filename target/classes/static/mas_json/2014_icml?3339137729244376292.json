{"title": "Doubly Stochastic Variational Bayes for non-Conjugate Inference.", "fields": ["bayesian statistics", "bayesian linear regression", "frequentist inference", "fiducial inference", "variable elimination"], "abstract": "We propose a simple and effective variational inference algorithm based on stochastic optimisation that can be widely applied for Bayesian non-conjugate inference in continuous parameter spaces. This algorithm is based on stochastic approximation and allows for efficient use of gradient information from the model joint density. We demonstrate these properties using illustrative examples as well as in challenging and diverse Bayesian inference problems such as variable selection in logistic regression and fully Bayesian inference over kernel hyperparameters in Gaussian process regression.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Athens University of Economics and Business", "Charles III University of Madrid"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Michalis K.
