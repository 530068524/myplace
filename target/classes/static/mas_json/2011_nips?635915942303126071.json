A simple and effective approach is to transfer samples from source tasks and include them in the training set used to solve a target task. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical properties of this transfer method and we introduce novel algorithms adapting the transfer process on the basis of the similarity between source and target tasks. Finally, we report illustrative experimental results in a continuous chain problem.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Alessandro Lazaric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazaric:Alessandro", "Marcello Restelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Restelli:Marcello"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
