{"title": "Convex Relaxations for Learning Bounded-Treewidth Decomposable Graphs.", "fields": ["bounded function", "local search", "polytope", "treewidth", "combinatorial optimization"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning the structure of undirected graphical models with bounded treewidth, within the maximum likelihood framework. This is an NP-hard problem and most approaches consider local search techniques. In this paper, we pose it as a combinatorial optimization problem, which is then relaxed to a convex optimization problem that involves searching over the forest and hyperforest polytopes with special structures. A supergradient method is used to solve the dual problem, with a run-time complexity of O(k3nk+2 log n) for each iteration, where n is the number of variables and k is a bound on the treewidth. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art methods on synthetic datasets and classical benchmarks, showing the gains of the novel convex approach.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["K.
