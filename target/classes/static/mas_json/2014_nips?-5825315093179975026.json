We present a novel recurrent neural network model that is capable of extracting information from an image or video by adaptively selecting a sequence of regions or locations and only processing the selected regions at high resolution. Like convolutional neural networks, the proposed model has a degree of translation invariance built-in, but the amount of computation it performs can be controlled independently of the input image size. While the model is non-differentiable, it can be trained using reinforcement learning methods to learn task-specific policies. We evaluate our model on several image classification tasks, where it significantly outperforms a convolutional neural network baseline on cluttered images, and on a dynamic visual control problem, where it learns to track a simple object without an explicit training signal for doing so.", "citation": "Citations (779)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Volodymyr Mnih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mnih:Volodymyr", "Nicolas Heess.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heess:Nicolas", "Alex Graves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Graves:Alex", "Koray Kavukcuoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kavukcuoglu:Koray"], "pages": 9}
