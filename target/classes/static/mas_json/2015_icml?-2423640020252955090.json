{"title": "Nested Sequential Monte Carlo Methods.", "fields": ["filter", "random variable", "mathematical optimization", "probability distribution", "particle filter"], "abstract": "We propose nested sequential Monte Carlo (NSMC), a methodology to sample from sequences of probability distributions, even where the random variables are high-dimensional. NSMC generalises the SMC framework by requiring only approximate, properly weighted, samples from the SMC proposal distribution, while still resulting in a correct SMC algorithm. Furthermore, NSMC can in itself be used to produce such properly weighted samples. Consequently, one NSMC sampler can be used to construct an efficient high-dimensional proposal distribution for another NSMC sampler, and this nesting of the algorithm can be done to an arbitrary degree. This allows us to consider complex and high-dimensional models using SMC. We show results that motivate the efficacy of our approach on several filtering problems with dimensions in the order of 100 to 1 000.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Link\u00f6ping University", "University of Cambridge", "Uppsala University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Christian A.
