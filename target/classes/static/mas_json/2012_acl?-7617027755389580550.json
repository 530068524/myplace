Unlike previous work on this topic, we formulate the problem as structured labeling over a much smaller graph, and we propose a novel structured label propagation for the task. We convert such graph-based translation consensus from similar source strings into useful features both for n-best output re-ranking and for decoding algorithm. Experimental results show that, our method can significantly improve machine translation performance on both IWSLT and NIST data, compared with a state-of-the-art baseline.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shujie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Shujie", "Chi-Ho Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chi=Ho", "Mu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mu", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming"], "pages": 9}
