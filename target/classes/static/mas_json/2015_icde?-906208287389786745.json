We approach this by fetching a small subgraph G Q  of G such that Q(G Q ) = Q(G). We show that many practical patterns are effectively bounded under access constraints A commonly found in real life, such that G Q  can be identified in time determined by Q and A only, independent of the size |G| of G. This holds no matter whether pattern queries are localized (e.g., via subgraph isomorphism) or non-localized (graph simulation). We provide algorithms to decide whether a pattern Q is effectively bounded, and if so, to generate a query plan that computes Q(G) by accessing G Q , in time independent of |G|. When Q is not effectively bounded, we give an algorithm to extend access constraints and make Q bounded in G. Using real-life data, we experimentally verify the effectiveness of the approach, e.g., about 60% of queries are effectively bounded for subgraph isomorphism, and for such queries our approach outperforms the conventional methods by 4 orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Beihang University", "University of Edinburgh", "Beihang University", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Yang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yang", "Wenfei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Wenfei", "Jinpeng Huai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huai:Jinpeng", "Ruizhe Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Ruizhe"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
