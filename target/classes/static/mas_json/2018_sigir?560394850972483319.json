{"title": "Multi-Target Stance Detection via a Dynamic Memory-Augmented Network.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "dynamic random access memory", "expression", "auxiliary memory", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Stance detection aims at inferring from text whether the author is in favor of, against, or neutral towards a target entity. Most of the existing studies consider different target entities separately. However, in many scenarios, stance targets are closely related, such as several candidates in a general election and different brands of the same product. Multi-target stance detection, in contrast, aims at jointly detecting stances towards multiple related targets. As stance expression regarding a target can provide additional information to help identify the stances towards other related targets, modeling expressions regarding multiple targets jointly is beneficial for improving the overall performance compared to single-target scheme. In this paper, we propose a dynamic memory-augmented network DMAN for multi-target stance detection. DMAN utilizes a shared external memory, which is dynamically updated through the learning process, to capture and store stance-indicative information for multiple related targets. It then jointly predicts stances towards these targets in a multitask manner. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our DMAN model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Penghui Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Penghui", "Junjie Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Junjie", "Wenji Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Wenji"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
