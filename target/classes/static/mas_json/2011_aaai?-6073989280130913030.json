{"title": "Adaptive Large Margin Training for Multilabel Classification.", "fields": ["exploit", "categorization", "scalability", "enumeration", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Multilabel classification is a central problem in many areas of data analysis, including text and multimedia categorization, where individual data objects need to be assigned multiple labels. A key challenge in these tasks is to learn a classifier that can properly exploit label correlations without requiring exponential enumeration of label subsets during training or testing. We investigate novel loss functions for multilabel training within a large margin framework\u2014identifying a simple alternative that yields improved generalization while still allowing efficient training. We furthermore show how co-variances between the label models can be learned simultaneously with the classification model itself, in a jointly convex formulation, without compromising scalability. The resulting combination yields state of the art accuracy in multilabel webpage classification.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Temple University", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Yuhong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yuhong", "Dale Schuurmans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuurmans:Dale"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
