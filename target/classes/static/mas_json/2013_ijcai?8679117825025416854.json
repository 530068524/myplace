Although each view could be individually used for finding patterns by clustering, the clustering performance could be more accurate by exploring the rich information among multiple views. Several multi-view clustering methods have been proposed to unsupervised integrate different views of data. However, they are graph based approaches, e.g. based on spectral clustering, such that they cannot handle the large-scale data. How to combine these heterogeneous features for unsupervised large-scale data clustering has become a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new robust large-scale multi-view clustering method to integrate heterogeneous representations of largescale data. We evaluate the proposed new methods by six benchmark data sets and compared the performance with several commonly used clustering approaches as well as the baseline multi-view clustering methods. In all experimental results, our proposed methods consistently achieve superiors clustering performances.", "citation": "Citations (193)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xiao Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Xiao", "Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Heng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Heng"], "pages": 7}
