{"title": "Cross media hyperlinking for search topic browsing.", "fields": ["social media", "video browsing", "storyboard", "automatic summarization", "hyperlink"], "abstract": "With the rapid growth of social media, there are plenty of information sources freely available online for use. Nevertheless, how to synchronize and leverage these diverse forms of information for multimedia applications remains a problem yet to be seriously studied. This paper investigates the synchronization of multiple media content in the physical form of hyperlinking them. The ultimate goal is to develop browsing systems that author search results with rich media information mined from various knowledge sources. The authoring enables the vivid visualization and exploration of different information landscapes inherent in search results. Several key techniques are studied in this paper for developing these browsing features. These techniques include content mining and selection from web videos, space-time alignment of multiple media, and augmenting of search result with  when  and  what  information. We conduct both quantitative and user studies on a large video dataset for performance evaluation. Comparison with traditional techniques including storyboard summarization and video skimming are also presented.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "University Tunk ...
