Building these systems involves the expensive process of annotating a large amount of data for each domain. A potential solution to this corpus annotation bottleneck is to build unsupervised polarity classification systems. However, unsupervised learning of polarity is difficult, owing in part to the prevalence of sentimentally ambiguous reviews, where reviewers discuss both the positive and negative aspects of a product. To address this problem, we propose a semi-supervised approach to sentiment classification where we first mine the unambiguous reviews using spectral techniques and then exploit them to classify the ambiguous reviews via a novel combination of active learning, transductive learning, and ensemble learning.", "citation": "Citations (162)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sajib Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Sajib", "Vincent Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Vincent"], "pages": 9}
