This study focuses on estimating 3-way resemblance (Jaccard similarity) using b-bit minwise hashing. While traditional minwise hashing methods store each hashed value using 64 bits, b-bit minwise hashing only stores the lowest 6 bits (where b \u2265 2 for 3-way). The extension to 3-way similarity from the prior work on 2-way similarity is technically non-trivial. We develop the precise estimator which is accurate and very complicated; and we recommend a much simplified estimator suitable for sparse data. Our analysis shows that b-bit minwise hashing can normally achieve a 10 to 25-fold improvement in the storage space required for a given estimator accuracy of the 3-way resemblance.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Microsoft", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Ping Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Ping", "Arnd Christian K\u00f6nig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=nig:Arnd_Christian", "Wenhao Gui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gui:Wenhao"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
