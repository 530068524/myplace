{"title": "An intra-chip free-space optical interconnect.", "fields": ["optical interconnect", "signal integrity", "free space optical communication", "interconnect bottleneck", "latency"], "abstract": "Continued device scaling enables microprocessors and other systems-on-chip (SoCs) to increase their performance, functionality, and hence, complexity. Simultaneously, relentless scaling, if uncompensated, degrades the performance and signal integrity of on-chip metal interconnects. These systems have therefore become increasingly communications-limited. The communications-centric nature of future high performance computing devices demands a fundamental change in intra- and inter-chip interconnect technologies.   Optical interconnect is a promising long term solution. However, while significant progress in optical  signaling  has been made in recent years,  networking  issues for on-chip optical interconnect still require much investigation. Taking the underlying optical signaling systems as a drop-in replacement for conventional electrical signaling while maintaining conventional packet-switching architectures is unlikely to realize the full potential of optical interconnects. In this paper, we propose and study the design of a fully distributed interconnect architecture based on free-space optics. The architecture leverages a suite of newly-developed or emerging devices, circuits, and optics technologies. The interconnect avoids packet relay altogether, offers an ultra-low transmission latency and scalable bandwidth, and provides fresh opportunities for coherency substrate designs and optimizations.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Jing Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Jing", "Alok Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Alok", "Berkehan Ciftcioglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciftcioglu:Berkehan", "Jianyun Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Jianyun", "Shang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shang", "Ioannis Savidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savidis:Ioannis", "Manish Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Manish", "Rebecca Berman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berman:Rebecca", "Peng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Peng", "Michael C.
