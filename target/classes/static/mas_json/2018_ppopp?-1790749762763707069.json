{"title": "Register optimizations for stencils on GPUs.", "fields": ["false sharing", "profiling", "stencil", "loop unrolling", "allocator"], "abstract": "The recent advent of compute-intensive GPU architecture has allowed application developers to explore high-order 3D stencils for better computational accuracy. A common optimization strategy for such stencils is to expose sufficient data reuse by means such as loop unrolling, with the expectation of register-level reuse. However, the resulting code is often highly constrained by register pressure. While current state-of-the-art register allocators are satisfactory for most applications, they are unable to effectively manage register pressure for such complex high-order stencils, resulting in sub-optimal code with a large number of register spills. In this paper, we develop a statement reordering framework that models stencil computations as a DAG of trees with shared leaves, and adapts an optimal scheduling algorithm for minimizing register usage for expression trees. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through experimental results on a range of stencils extracted from application codes.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Colorado State University", "Ohio State University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Prashant Singh Rawat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rawat:Prashant_Singh", "Fabrice Rastello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rastello:Fabrice", "Aravind Sukumaran-Rajam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sukumaran=Rajam:Aravind", "Louis-No\u00ebl Pouchet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pouchet:Louis=No=euml=l", "Atanas Rountev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rountev:Atanas", "P.
