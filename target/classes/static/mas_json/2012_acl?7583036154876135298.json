{"title": "Learning Syntactic Verb Frames using Graphical Models.", "fields": ["verb", "graphical model", "augment", "subcategorization", "parsing"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach for building verb subcategorization lexicons using a simple graphical model. In contrast to previous methods, we show how the model can be trained without parsed input or a predefined subcategorization frame inventory. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on a verb clustering task, and is easily trained on arbitrary domains. This quantitative evaluation is complemented by a qualitative discussion of verbs and their frames. We discuss the advantages of graphical models for this task, in particular the ease of integrating semantic information about verbs and arguments in a principled fashion. We conclude with future work to augment the approach.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Thomas Lippincott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lippincott:Thomas", "Anna Korhonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korhonen:Anna", "Diarmuid \u00d3 S\u00e9aghdha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=eacute=aghdha:Diarmuid_=Oacute="], "pages": 10}
