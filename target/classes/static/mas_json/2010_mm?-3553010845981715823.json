HVA involves making a series of  fixations  on select locations while performing tasks such as object recognition, scene understanding,  etc . We present one of the first works that combines fixation information with automated concept detectors to (i) infer  abstract image semantics , and (ii) enhance performance of object detectors.   We develop visual attention-based models that sample fixation distributions and fixation transition distributions in  regions-of-interest  (ROI) to infer abstract semantics such as  expressive  faces and interactions (such as  look ,  read ,  etc. ). We also exploit eye-gaze information to deduce possible locations and scale of  salient  concepts and aid state-of-art detectors. A 18% performance increase with over 80% reduction in computational time for a state-of-art object detector [4].", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "University of Trento", "National University of Singapore", "University of Trento", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Harish Katti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katti:Harish", "Subramanian Ramanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanathan:Subramanian", "Mohan S.
