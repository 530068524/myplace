A new robust approach for separation of murmur from heart sound has been suggested in this article. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) has been adapted to the changes in the statistical properties of the data and effectively used for detection of murmur from single-channel heart sound (HS) signals. Incorporating a cleverly selected a priori within the SSA reconstruction process, results in an accurate separation of normal HS from the murmur segment. Another contribution of this work is selection of the correct subspace of the desired signal component automatically. In addition, the subspace size can be identified iteratively. A number of HS signals with murmur have been processed using the proposed adaptive SSA (ASSA) technique and the results have been quantified both objectively and subjectively.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "Cardiff University", "Cardiff University", "Mayo Clinic", "Mayo Clinic", "Mayo Clinic", "Mayo Clinic", "Mayo Clinic", "Lund University", "Lund University", "Helsinki University of Technology", "Lund University", "Helsinki University of Technology", "\u00d6rebro University", "Link\u00f6ping University", "\u00d6rebro University", "Link\u00f6ping University", "Link\u00f6ping University", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "National University of Colombia", "Technical University of Madrid", "University of Alcal\u00e1", "National University of Colombia", "University Hospital", "County Hospital Ryhov", "The authors are ... ma@umin.ac.jp,", "The authors are ... ma@umin.ac.jp,", "The authors are ... ma@umin.ac.jp,", "Instituto Tecno ... tropolitano ITM"], "authors": ["Peter Byrne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Byrne:Peter"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
