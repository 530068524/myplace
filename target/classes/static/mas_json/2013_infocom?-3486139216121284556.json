We develop a proactive download scheme that utilizes the probabilistic predictability of the human demand by proactively serving potential users' future requests during the off-peak times. Thus, it smooths-out the network traffic and minimizes the time average cost of service. Moreover, we incorporate the varying economic responsiveness and demand flexibilities of users into our model to develop a demand shaping mechanism that further improves the gains of proactive downloads. To that end, we propose a model that captures the uncertainty about the users' demand as well as their responsiveness to the pricing employed by the service providers. We propose a joint proactive resource allocation and demand shaping scheme based on nonconvex optimization algorithms, and show that it always leads to strictly better performance over its proactive counterpart without demand shaping.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["John Tadrous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tadrous:John", "Atilla Eryilmaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eryilmaz:Atilla", "Hesham El Gamal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gamal:Hesham_El"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
