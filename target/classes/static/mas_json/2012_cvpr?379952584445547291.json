Much previous work was based on MRFs with hand-crafted networks, yet the underlying graphical structure is rarely explored. In this paper, we show that if appropriately estimated, the MRF's graphical structure, which captures significant information about appearance and motion, can provide crucial guidance to low level vision tasks. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to solve low level vision tasks via an exponential family of MRFs with variable structures, which we call Switchable MRFs. The approach explicitly seeks a structure that optimally adapts to the image or video along the pursuit of task-specific goals. Through theoretical analysis and experimental study, we demonstrate that the proposed method addresses a number of drawbacks suffered by previous methods, including failure to capture heavy-tail statistics, computational difficulties, and lack of generality.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dahua Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Dahua", "John W.
