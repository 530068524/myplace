{"title": "A Multi-Agent Control Architecture for a Rescue Robot.", "fields": ["implementation", "cognitive architecture", "control system", "architecture", "rescue robot"], "abstract": "Cognitive architectures investigate the components and interactions neccessary for construction of an intelligent system. Despite much progress and theory, implementations of architectures are rare. This research presents a novel cognitive architecture grounded in the design of a control system for an autonomous rescue robot. Experiments are conducted in high-fidelity 3D simulation of a rescue environment based on NISTs RoboCup Rescue.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Adam Haber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haber:Adam"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
