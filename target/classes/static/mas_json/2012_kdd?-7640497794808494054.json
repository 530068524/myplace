A number of questions arise in the context of this task: how do we formalize and quantify the competitiveness relationship between two items? Who are the true competitors of a given item? What are the features of an item that most affect its competitiveness? Despite the impact and relevance of this problem to many domains, only a limited amount of work has been devoted toward an effective solution. In this paper, we present a formal definition of the competitiveness between two items. We present efficient methods for evaluating competitiveness in large datasets and address the natural problem of finding the top-k competitors of a given item. Our methodology is evaluated against strong baselines via a user study and experiments on multiple datasets from different domains.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Boston University", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"], "authors": ["Theodoros Lappas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lappas:Theodoros", "George Valkanas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valkanas:George", "Dimitrios Gunopulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gunopulos:Dimitrios"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
