{"title": "Global Transition-based Non-projective Dependency Parsing.", "fields": ["implementation", "projective test", "decoding methods", "dependency grammar", "parsing"], "abstract": "Shi, Huang, and Lee (2017) obtained state-of-the-art results for English and Chinese dependency parsing by combining dynamic-programming implementations of transition-based dependency parsers with a minimal set of bidirectional LSTM features. However, their results were limited to projective parsing. In this paper, we extend their approach to support non-projectivity by providing the first practical implementation of the MH_4 algorithm, an $O(n^4)$ mildly nonprojective dynamic-programming parser with very high coverage on non-projective treebanks. To make MH_4 compatible with minimal transition-based feature sets, we introduce a transition-based interpretation of it in which parser items are mapped to sequences of transitions. We thus obtain the first implementation of global decoding for non-projective transition-based parsing, and demonstrate empirically that it is more effective than its projective counterpart in parsing a number of highly non-projective languages", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of A Coru\u00f1a", "Tsinghua University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Lillian Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Lillian", "Carlos G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=oacute=mez=Rodr=iacute=guez:Carlos", "Tianze Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Tianze"], "pages": 12}
