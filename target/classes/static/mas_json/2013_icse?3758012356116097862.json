However, this functionality operates on one version of the code at a time. We envision a new approach that makes code completion and navigation aware of code evolution and enables them to operate on multiple versions at a time, without having to manually switch across these versions. We illustrate our approach on several example scenarios. We also describe a prototype Eclipse plugin that embodies our approach for code completion and navigation for Java code. We believe our approach opens a new line of research that adds a novel, temporal dimension for treating code in IDEs in the context of tasks that previously required manual switching across different code versions.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Yun Young Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yun_Young", "Sam Harwell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harwell:Sam", "Sarfraz Khurshid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khurshid:Sarfraz", "Darko Marinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinov:Darko"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
