{"title": "Detecting Multilingual and Multi-Regional Query Intent in Web Search.", "fields": ["ranking", "search engine", "probabilistic logic", "web search query", "semantic search"], "abstract": "With rapid growth of commercial search engines, detecting multilingual and multi-regional intent underlying search queries becomes a critical challenge to serve international users with diverse language and region requirements. We introduce a query intent probabilistic model, whose input is the number of clicks on documents from different regions and in different language, while the output of this model is a smoothed probabilistic distribution of multilingual and multi-regional query intent. Based on an editorial test to evaluate the accuracy of the intent classifier, our probabilistic model could improve the accuracy of multilingual intent detection for 15%, and improve multi-regional intent detection for 18%. To improve web search quality, we propose a set of new ranking features to combine multilingual and multi-regional query intent with document language/region attributes, and apply different approaches in integrating intent information to directly affect ranking. The experiments show that the novel features could provide 2.31% NDCG@1 improvement and 1.81% NDCG@5 improvement.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Yi Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yi", "Ruiqiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ruiqiang", "Srihari Reddy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reddy:Srihari", "Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
