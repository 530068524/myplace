Gurvits\u00e2  s permanent inequality gives a lower bound on the coefficient of the  z  1  z  2 \u00e2 \ufffd  z   n   monomial of a real stable polynomial  p  with nonnegative coefficients. This fundamental inequality has been used to attack several counting and optimization problems. Here, we study a more general question: Given a stable multilinear polynomial  p  with nonnegative coefficients and a set of monomials  S , we show that if the polynomial obtained by summing up all monomials in  S  is real stable, then we can lower bound the sum of coefficients of monomials of  p  that are in  S . We also prove generalizations of this theorem to (real stable) polynomials that are not multilinear. We use our theorem to give a new proof of Schrijver\u00e2  s inequality on the number of perfect matchings of a regular bipartite graph, generalize a recent result of Nikolov and Singh, and give deterministic polynomial time approximation algorithms for several counting problems.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of Washington"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Nima Anari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anari:Nima", "Shayan Oveis Gharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gharan:Shayan_Oveis"], "pages": 13}
