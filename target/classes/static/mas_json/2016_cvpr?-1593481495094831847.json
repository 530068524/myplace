Zero-shot learning is one way of addressing these challenges, but it has only been shown to work with limited sized class vocabularies and typically requires separation between supervised and unsupervised classes, allowing former to inform the latter but not vice versa. We propose the notion of semi-supervised vocabulary-informed learning to alleviate the above mentioned challenges and address problems of supervised, zero-shot and open set recognition using a unified framework. Specifically, we propose a maximum margin framework for semantic manifoldbased recognition that incorporates distance constraints from (both supervised and unsupervised) vocabulary atoms, ensuring that labeled samples are projected closest to their correct prototypes, in the embedding space, than to others. We show that resulting model shows improvements in supervised, zero-shot, and large open set recognition, with up to 310K class vocabulary on AwA and ImageNet datasets.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Disney Research"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yanwei Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Yanwei", "Leonid Sigal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sigal:Leonid"], "pages": 10}
