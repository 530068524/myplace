{"title": "ClassSearch: facilitating the development of web search skills through social learning.", "fields": ["multimedia", "social learning", "software deployment", "dreyfus model of skill acquisition", "iterative design"], "abstract": "We explore the use of social learning - improving knowledge skills by observing peer behavior - in the domain of Web search skill acquisition, focusing specifically on co-located classroom scenarios. Through a series of interviews, pilot studies, and classroom deployments, we conclude that a peripheral display of Web search activity within a classroom facilitates both social learning and teacher-led discourse. We present the ClassSearch system for shared awareness of Web search activity, which embodies principles gleaned from our iterative design process, and show results from a ClassSearch deployment in twelve middle-school classroom sessions. Finally, we highlight design suggestions and opportunities for future work while taxonomizing the space of co-located search pedagogies.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Neema Moraveji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moraveji:Neema", "Meredith Ringel Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Meredith_Ringel", "Daniel Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris_0001:Daniel", "Mary Czerwinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czerwinski:Mary", "Nathalie Henry Riche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riche:Nathalie_Henry"], "pages": 10}
