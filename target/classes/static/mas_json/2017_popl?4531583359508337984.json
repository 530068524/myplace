One of these, I  CFA , is a promising theory based on stack change but is undermined by its finite-state model of the stack. We present Pushdown I  CFA  which takes a I  CFA -approach to pushdown models of control flow and can cope with multiply-bound variables, even in the face of recursion.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "authors": ["Kimball Germane.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Germane:Kimball", "Matthew Might.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Might:Matthew"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
