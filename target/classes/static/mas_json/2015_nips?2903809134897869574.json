Existing neuroimaging methods typically perform either discovery of unknown neural structure or testing of neural structure associated with mental tasks. However, testing hypotheses on the neural correlates underlying larger sets of mental tasks necessitates adequate representations for the observations. We therefore propose to blend representation modelling and task classification into a unified statistical learning problem. A multinomial logistic regression is introduced that is constrained by factored coefficients and coupled with an autoencoder. We show that this approach yields more accurate and interpretable neural models of psychological tasks in a reference dataset, as well as better generalization to other datasets.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Danilo Bzdok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bzdok:Danilo", "Michael Eickenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eickenberg:Michael", "Olivier Grisel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grisel:Olivier", "Bertrand Thirion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thirion:Bertrand", "Ga\u00ebl Varoquaux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varoquaux:Ga=euml=l"], "pages": 9}
