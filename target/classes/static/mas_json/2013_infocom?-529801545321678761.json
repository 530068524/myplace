{"title": "On achieving all-optical failure restoration via monitoring trails.", "fields": ["computer network", "traverse", "distributed computing", "bandwidth", "computer science"], "abstract": "The paper investigates a novel monitoring trail (m-trail) scenario that can enable any shared protection scheme for achieving all-optical and ultra-fast failure restoration. Given a set of working (W-LPs) and protection (P-LPs) lightpaths, we firstly define the neighborhood of a node, which is a set of links whose failure states should be known to the node in restoration of the corresponding W-LPs. A set of m-trails is routed such that each node can localize any failure in its neighborhood according to the ON-OFF status of the traversing m-trails. Bound analysis is performed on the minimum bandwidth required for the m-trails. Extensive simulation is conducted to verify the proposed scheme.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "MTA-BME Future  ... y of Technology", "MTA-BME Future  ... y of Technology"], "authors": ["J\u00e1nos Tapolcai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tapolcai:J=aacute=nos", "Pin-Han Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Pin=Han", "P\u00e9ter Babarczi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babarczi:P=eacute=ter", "Lajos R\u00f3nyai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=oacute=nyai:Lajos"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
