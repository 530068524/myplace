{"title": "UCBoost: A Boosting Approach to Tame Complexity and Optimality for Stochastic Bandits.", "fields": ["open problem", "machine learning", "regret", "computational complexity theory", "boosting"], "abstract": "In this work, we address the open problem of finding low-complexity near-optimal multi-armed bandit algorithms for sequential decision making problems. Existing bandit algorithms are either sub-optimal and computationally simple (e.g., UCB1) or optimal and computationally complex (e.g., kl-UCB). We propose a boosting approach to Upper Confidence Bound based algorithms for stochastic bandits, that we call UCBoost. Specifically, we propose two types of UCBoost algorithms. We show that UCBoost($D$) enjoys $O(1)$ complexity for each arm per round as well as regret guarantee that is $1/e$-close to that of the kl-UCB algorithm. We propose an approximation-based UCBoost algorithm, UCBoost($\\epsilon$), that enjoys a regret guarantee $\\epsilon$-close to that of kl-UCB as well as $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ complexity for each arm per round. Hence, our algorithms provide practitioners a practical way to trade optimality with computational complexity. Finally, we present numerical results which show that UCBoost($\\epsilon$) can achieve the same regret performance as the standard kl-UCB while incurring only $1\\%$ of the computational cost of kl-UCB.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "AT&T Labs", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Fang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Fang", "Sinong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Sinong", "Swapna Buccapatnam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buccapatnam:Swapna", "Ness B.
