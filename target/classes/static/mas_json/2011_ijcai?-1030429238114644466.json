{"title": "Reinforcement Learning to Adjust Robot Movements to New Situations.", "fields": ["error driven learning", "throwing", "reinforcement learning", "machine learning", "motor skill", "robot learning", "robot", "simulation"], "abstract": "Many complex robot motor skills can be represented using elementary movements, and there exist efficient techniques for learning parametrized motor plans using demonstrations and self-improvement. However with current techniques, in many cases, the robot currently needs to learn a new elementary movement even if a parametrized motor plan exists that covers a related situation. A method is needed that modulates the elementary movement through the meta-parameters of its representation. In this paper, we describe how to learn such mappings from circumstances to meta-parameters using reinforcement learning. In particular we use a kernelized version of the reward-weighted regression. We show two robot applications of the presented setup in robotic domains; the generalization of throwing movements in darts, and of hitting movements in table tennis. We demonstrate that both tasks can be learned successfully using simulated and real robots.", "citation": "Citations (113)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "Max Planck Society", "MPI T\u00fcbingen, Germany", "ATR, CMC, Japan", "MPI T\u00fcbingen, Germany"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jens Kober.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kober:Jens", "Erhan \u00d6ztop.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ouml=ztop:Erhan", "Jan Peters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peters_0001:Jan"], "pages": 6}
