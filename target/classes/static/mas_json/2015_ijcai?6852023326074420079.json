{"title": "Feature Ensemble Plus Sample Selection: Domain Adaptation for Sentiment Classification (Extended Abstract).", "fields": ["domain adaptation", "pattern recognition", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The domain adaptation problem arises often in the field of sentiment classification. There are two distinct needs in domain adaptation, namely labeling adaptation and instance adaptation. Most of current research focuses on the former one, while neglects the latter one. In this work, we propose a joint approach, named feature ensemble plus sample selection (SS-FE), which takes both types of adaptation into account. A feature ensemble (FE) model is first proposed to learn a new labeling function in a feature re-weighting manner. Furthermore, a PCA-based sample selection (PCA-SS) method is proposed as an aid to FE for instance adaptation. Experimental results show that the proposed SSFE approach could gain significant improvements, compared to individual FE and PCA-SS, due to its comprehensive consideration of both labeling adaptation and instance adaptation.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Nanjing University of Science and Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Queensland", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Rui Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Rui", "Chengqing Zong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zong:Chengqing", "Xuelei Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Xuelei", "Erik Cambria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cambria:Erik"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 5}
