{"title": "Free to Fly in Public Spaces: Drone Controllers' Privacy Perceptions and Practices.", "fields": ["notice", "drone", "computer security", "information privacy", "internet privacy"], "abstract": "Prior research has discovered various privacy concerns that bystanders have about drones. However, little is known about drone controllers' privacy perceptions and practices of drones. Understanding controllers' perspective is important because it will inform whether controllers' current practices protect or infringe on bystanders' privacy and what mechanisms could be designed to better address the potential privacy issues of drones. In this paper, we report results from interviews of 12 drone controllers in the US. Our interviewees treated safety as their top priority but considered privacy issues of drones exaggerated. Our results also highlight many significant differences in how controllers and bystanders think about drone privacy, for instance, how they determine public vs. private spaces and whether notice and consent of bystanders are needed.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Syracuse University", "Syracuse University", "Syracuse University", "Syracuse University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yaxing Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Yaxing", "Huichuan Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Huichuan", "Yun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0003:Yun", "Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0005:Yang"], "pages": 5}
