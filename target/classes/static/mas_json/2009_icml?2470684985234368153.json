{"title": "A scalable framework for discovering coherent co-clusters in noisy data.", "fields": ["data point", "microarray analysis techniques", "expression", "scalability", "linear subspace"], "abstract": "Clustering problems often involve datasets where only a part of the data is relevant to the problem, e.g., in microarray data analysis only a subset of the genes show cohesive expressions within a subset of the conditions/features. The existence of a large number of non-informative data points and features makes it challenging to hunt for coherent and meaningful clusters from such datasets. Additionally, since clusters could exist in different subspaces of the feature space, a co-clustering algorithm that simultaneously clusters objects and features is often more suitable as compared to one that is restricted to traditional \"one-sided\" clustering. We propose Robust Overlapping Co-Clustering (ROCC), a scalable and very versatile framework that addresses the problem of efficiently mining dense, arbitrarily positioned, possibly overlapping co-clusters from large, noisy datasets. ROCC has several desirable properties that make it extremely well suited to a number of real life applications.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Meghana Deodhar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deodhar:Meghana", "Gunjan Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Gunjan", "Joydeep Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Joydeep", "Hyuk Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Hyuk", "Inderjit S.
