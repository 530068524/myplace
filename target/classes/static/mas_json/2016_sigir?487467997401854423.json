{"title": "Dynamically Integrating Item Exposure with Rating Prediction in Collaborative Filtering.", "fields": ["movielens", "novelty", "leverage", "collaborative filtering", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "The paper proposes a novel approach to appropriately promote those items with few ratings in collaborative filtering. Different from previous works, we force the items with few ratings to be promoted to the users who would potentially be able to give ratings, and then leverage the gathered user preference to punish the promoted items with low quality intrinsically. By slightly sacrificing the benefit of recommending the best items in terms of user satisfaction, our approach seeks to provide all of the items with a chance to be visible equally. The results of the experiments conducted on MovieLens and Netflix data demonstrate its feasibility.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Ting-Yi Shih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shih:Ting=Yi", "Ting-Chang Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:Ting=Chang", "Jian-De Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Jian=De", "Yen-Chieh Lien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lien:Yen=Chieh", "Chia-Rui Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chia=Rui", "Pu-Jen Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Pu=Jen"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
