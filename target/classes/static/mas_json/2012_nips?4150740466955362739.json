{"title": "Scalable Inference of Overlapping Communities.", "fields": ["machine learning", "theoretical computer science", "inference", "scalability", "community structure"], "abstract": "We develop a scalable algorithm for posterior inference of overlapping communities in large networks. Our algorithm is based on stochastic variational inference in the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB). It naturally interleaves subsampling the network with estimating its community structure. We apply our algorithm on ten large, real-world networks with up to 60,000 nodes. It converges several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm for MMSB, finds hundreds of communities in large real-world networks, and detects the true communities in 280 benchmark networks with equal or better accuracy compared to other scalable algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Prem Gopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalan:Prem", "David M.
