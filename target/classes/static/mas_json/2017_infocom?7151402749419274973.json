{"title": "Coexistence of Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) and Wi-Fi: Implications to Wi-Fi performance.", "fields": ["throughput", "bandwidth", "channelized", "dedicated short range communications", "testbed"], "abstract": "The 5.9 GHz band is being actively explored for possible spectrum sharing opportunities between Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) and IEEE 802.11ac networks in order to address the increasing demand for bandwidth-intensive Wi-Fi applications. In this paper, we study the implications of this spectrum sharing to the performance of Wi-Fi systems. Through experiments performed on our testbed, we first investigate band sharing options available for Wi-Fi devices. Using experimental results, we show the need for using conservative Wi-Fi transmission parameters to enable harmonious coexistence between DSRC and Wi-Fi. Moreover, we show that under the current 802.11ac standard, certain channelization options, particularly the high bandwidth ones, cannot be used by Wi-Fi devices without causing interference to the DSRC nodes. Under these constraints, we propose a Real-time Channelization Algorithm (RCA) for Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) operating in the shared spectrum. Evaluation of the proposed algorithm using a prototype implementation on commodity hardware as well as via simulations show that informed channelization decisions can significantly increase Wi-Fi throughput compared to static channelization schemes.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Gaurang Naik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naik:Gaurang", "Jinshan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jinshan", "Jung-Min Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park_0001:Jung=Min"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
