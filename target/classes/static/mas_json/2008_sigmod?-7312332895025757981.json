However, the computation of such queries are usually performed by information fusion techniques. Information fusion has been used by applications to detect/classify events, track targets, and filter noisy measurements. In this tutorial, we discuss some of the information fusion techniques that are currently used in WSNs.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Research and Te ...
