{"title": "The Importance of Rule Restrictions in CCG.", "fields": ["mildly context sensitive grammar formalism", "generative grammar", "combinatory categorial grammar", "tree adjoining grammar", "universal set"], "abstract": "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) is generally construed as a fully lexicalized formalism, where all grammars use one and the same universal set of rules, and cross-linguistic variation is isolated in the lexicon. In this paper, we show that the weak generative capacity of this 'pure' form of CCG is strictly smaller than that of CCG with grammar-specific rules, and of other mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms, including Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG). Our result also carries over to a multi-modal extension of CCG.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Saarland University", "University of Padua"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Marco Kuhlmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhlmann:Marco", "Alexander Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Alexander", "Giorgio Satta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satta:Giorgio"], "pages": 10}
