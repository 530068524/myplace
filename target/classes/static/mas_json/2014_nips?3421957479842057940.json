{"title": "Deep Learning Face Representation by Joint Identification-Verification.", "fields": ["deep learning", "training set", "facial recognition system", "information technology", "word error rate"], "abstract": "The key challenge of face recognition is to develop effective feature representations for reducing intra-personal variations while enlarging inter-personal differences. In this paper, we show that it can be well solved with deep learning and using both face identification and verification signals as supervision. The Deep IDentification-verification features (DeepID2) are learned with carefully designed deep convolutional networks. The face identification task increases the inter-personal variations by drawing DeepID2 features extracted from different identities apart, while the face verification task reduces the intra-personal variations by pulling DeepID2 features extracted from the same identity together, both of which are essential to face recognition. The learned DeepID2 features can be well generalized to new identities unseen in the training data. On the challenging LFW dataset [11], 99.15% face verification accuracy is achieved. Compared with the best previous deep learning result [20] on LFW, the error rate has been significantly reduced by 67%.", "citation": "Citations (887)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "SenseTime Group"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yi Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yi", "Yuheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yuheng", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "pages": 9}
