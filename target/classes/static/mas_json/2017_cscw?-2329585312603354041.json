{"title": "Viewing the Viewers: Publishers' Desires and Viewers' Privacy Concerns in Social Networks.", "fields": ["internet privacy", "social network", "chilling effect", "psychology"], "abstract": "Social networking sites are starting to provide users with services that expose information about their audiences' composition and behavior, such as LinkedIn's 'Who's viewed my profile' feature. Providing information about content viewers to content publishers, however, raises new privacy concerns for viewers themselves, possibly creating a chilling effect on viewer behavior. We report on a study of 718 respondents using Mechanical Turk across two surveys to study publishers' (N=402) use and expectations of information about their viewers, and viewers' (N=316) privacy behaviors and concerns in the face of such visibility. Our findings indicate that publishers are generally mindful of viewers' privacy; viewers engage in various self-censorship behaviors in the face of visibility; and in some cases (e.g., dating sites) significant gender differences exist about what information respondents felt should be shared with publishers and required of viewers.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Indiana University", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Roberto Hoyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoyle:Roberto", "Srijita Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Srijita", "Apu Kapadia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapadia:Apu", "Adam J.
