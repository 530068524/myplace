Over one million blogs were analyzed from their conception through June 2006.

Covariation among LIWC dictionaries suggests that blogs vary along five psychologically relevant linguistic dimensions: Melancholy, Socialness, Ranting, Metaphysicality, and Work-Relatedness. These variables and others were subjected to a cluster analysis in an attempt to extract natural usage groups to inform design of blogging systems, the results of which were mixed.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Oregon", "Google"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Adam D.
