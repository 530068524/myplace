We model a firm which wishes to exploit its knowledge capital abroad, but whose workers learn all the knowledge necessary for production and can defect and produce the good themselves. The home firm must then choose between costly exporting and the possible dissipation of its knowledge capital by producing abroad. The paper examines the choice between exporting, licensing, and acquiring a subsidiary in this environment. We analyze the cost and technology parameters that support the alternative modes of serving the foreign market, and we describe the international equilibrium that jointly determines the pattern of specialization and the market mode.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "National Bureau of Economic Research", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yakov Babichenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babichenko:Yakov", "Oren Dean.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dean:Oren", "Moshe Tennenholtz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tennenholtz:Moshe"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
