{"title": "Link Gradients: Predicting the Impact of Network Latency on Multitier Applications.", "fields": ["latency", "planetlab", "server", "software metric", "database transaction"], "abstract": "Geographically dispersed deployments of large and complex multitier enterprise applications introduce many chal- lenges, including those involved in predicting the impact of network latency on end-to-end transaction response times. Here, a measurement-based approach to quantifying this impact using a new metric called the link gradient is presented. A non-intrusive technique for measuring the link gradient in running systems using delay injection and spectral analysis is presented, along with experimental results on PlanetLab that demonstrate that the link gradient can be used to predict end-to-end responsiveness, even in new and untested application configurations.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "AT&T", "AT&T", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "AT&T"], "authors": ["Shuyi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shuyi", "Kaustubh R.
