Based on this approach, a prototype platform, called iCon, is developed to explore the possible design. Field studies and user studies reveal that utilizing everyday objects such as auxiliary input devices might be appropriate under a multi-task scenario. User studies further demonstrate that daily objects can generally be applied in low precision circumstances, low engagement with selected objects, and medium-to-high frequency of use. The proposed approach allows users to interact with computers while not altering their original work environments.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University of Science and Technology", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kai-Yin Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Kai=Yin", "Rong-Hao Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Rong=Hao", "Bing-Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bing=Yu", "Rung-Huei Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Rung=Huei", "Sy-Yen Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Sy=Yen"], "pages": 10}
