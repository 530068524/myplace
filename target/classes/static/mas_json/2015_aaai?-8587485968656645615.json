{"title": "Efficient Task Sub-Delegation for Crowdsourcing.", "fields": ["delegation", "crowdsourcing", "workload", "reputation", "intelligent agent"], "abstract": "Reputation-based approaches allow a crowdsourcing system to identify reliable workers to whom tasks can be delegated. In crowdsourcing systems that can be modeled as multi-agent trust networks consist of resource constrained trustee agents (i.e., workers), workers may need to further sub-delegate tasks to others if they determine that they cannot complete all pending tasks before the stipulated deadlines. Existing reputation-based decision-making models cannot help workers decide when and to whom to sub-delegate tasks. In this paper, we proposed a reputation aware task sub-delegation (RTS) approach to bridge this gap. By jointly considering a worker's reputation, workload, the price of its effort and its trust relationships with others, RTS can be implemented as an intelligent agent to help workers make sub-delegation decisions in a distributed manner. The resulting task allocation maximizes social welfare through efficient utilization of the collective capacity of a crowd, and provides provable performance guarantees. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches based on the Epinions trust network demonstrate significant advantages of RTS under high workload conditions.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "University of British Columbia", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Han Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Han", "Chunyan Miao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miao:Chunyan", "Zhiqi Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Zhiqi", "Cyril Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Cyril", "Yiqiang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yiqiang", "Qiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Qiang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
