{"title": "A flow model for joint action recognition and identity maintenance.", "fields": ["inference", "active appearance model", "minimum cost flow problem", "flow network", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "We propose a framework that performs action recognition and identity maintenance of multiple targets simultaneously. Instead of first establishing tracks using an appearance model and then performing action recognition, we construct a network flow-based model that links detected bounding boxes across video frames while inferring activities, thus integrating identity maintenance and action recognition. Inference in our model reduces to a constrained minimum cost flow problem, which we solve exactly and efficiently. By leveraging both appearance similarity and action transition likelihoods, our model improves on state-of-the-art results on action recognition for two datasets.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sameh Khamis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khamis:Sameh", "Vlad I.
