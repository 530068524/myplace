Different from existing work, which performs assignment of words based solely on closeness in descriptor space, we focus on identifying pairs of independent, distant words - the visual synonyms - that are still likely to host image patches with similar appearance. To study this problems we focus on landmark images, where we can examine whether image geometry is an appropriate vehicle for detecting visual synonyms. We propose an algorithm for the extraction of visual synonyms in landmark images. To show the merit of visual synonyms, we perform two experiments. We examine closeness of synonyms in descriptor space and we show a first application of visual synonyms in a landmark image retrieval setting. Using visual synonyms, we perform on par with the state-of-the-art, but with six times less visual words.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Efstratios Gavves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavves:Efstratios", "Cees G.
