{"title": "CloudMonatt: an architecture for security health monitoring and attestation of virtual machines in cloud computing.", "fields": ["cloud computing security", "cloud computing", "semantic gap", "virtual machine", "server"], "abstract": "Cloud customers need guarantees regarding the security of their virtual machines (VMs), operating within an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud system. This is complicated by the customer not knowing where his VM is executing, and on the semantic gap between what the customer wants to know versus what can be measured in the cloud. We present an architecture for monitoring a VM's security health, with the ability to attest this to the customer in an unforgeable manner. We show a concrete implementation of property-based attestation and a full prototype based on the OpenStack open source cloud software.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Tianwei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Tianwei", "Ruby B.
