A DSP shows the small set of memory operations and data-flows responsible for a failure, as well as a reordering of those elements that avoids the failure. To build a DSP, Symbiosis first generates a full, failing, multithreaded schedule via thread path profiling and symbolic constraint solving. Symbiosis selectively reorders events in the failing schedule to produce a non-failing, alternate schedule. A DSP reports the ordering and data-flow differences between the failing and non-failing schedules. Our evaluation on buggy real-world software and benchmarks shows that, in practical time, Symbiosis generates DSPs that both isolate the small fraction of event orders and data-flows responsible for the failure, and show which event reorderings prevent failing. In our experiments, DSPs contain 81% fewer events and 96% less data-flows than the full failure-inducing schedules. Moreover, by allowing developers to focus on only a few events, DSPs reduce the amount of time required to find a valid fix.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Lisbon", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Lisbon", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "INESC-ID", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico"], "authors": ["Nuno Machado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Machado:Nuno", "Brandon Lucia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucia:Brandon", "Lu\u00eds E.
