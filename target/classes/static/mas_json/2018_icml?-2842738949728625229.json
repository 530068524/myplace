{"title": "Stein Points.", "fields": ["kernel", "computational statistics", "empirical measure", "posterior probability", "frank wolfe algorithm"], "abstract": "An important task in computational statistics and machine learning is to approximate a posterior distribution $p(x)$ with an empirical measure supported on a set of representative points $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$. This paper focuses on methods where the selection of points is essentially deterministic, with an emphasis on achieving accurate approximation when $n$ is small. To this end, we present `Stein Points'. The idea is to exploit either a greedy or a conditional gradient method to iteratively minimise a kernel Stein discrepancy between the empirical measure and $p(x)$. Our empirical results demonstrate that Stein Points enable accurate approximation of the posterior at modest computational cost. In addition, theoretical results are provided to establish convergence of the method.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "Microsoft", "Stanford University", "University of Warwick", "Newcastle University"], "authors": ["Wilson Ye Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wilson_Ye", "Lester W.
