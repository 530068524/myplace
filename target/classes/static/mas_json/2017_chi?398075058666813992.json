{"title": "GhostID: Enabling Non-Persistent User Differentiation in Frequency-Division Capacitive Multi-Touch Sensors.", "fields": ["multi touch", "controller", "ghosting", "frequency divider", "input device"], "abstract": "Current touch devices are adept at tracking finger touches, but cannot distinguish if multiple touches are caused by different fingers on a single hand, by fingers from both hands of a single user, or by different users. This limitation significantly reduces the possibilities for interaction techniques in touch interfaces. We present  GhostID , a capacitive sensor that can differentiate the origins of multiple simultaneous touches. Our approach analyzes the signal ghosting, already present as an artifact in a frequency-division touch controller, to differentiate touches from the same hand or different hands of a single user (77% reliability at 60 fps) or from two different users (95% reliability at 60 fps). In addition to  GhostID , we also develop a framework of user-differentiation capabilities for touch input devices, and illustrate a set of interaction techniques enabled by  GhostID .", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Tactual Labs, N ... w York, NY, USA", "Tactual Labs, T ... nto, ON, Canada", "Tactual Labs, N ... w York, NY, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sidharth Sahdev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahdev:Sidharth", "Clifton Forlines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forlines:Clifton", "Ricardo Jota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jota:Ricardo", "Bruno Rodrigues De Ara\u00fajo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ara=uacute=jo:Bruno_Rodrigues_De", "Braon Moseley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moseley:Braon", "Jonathan Deber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deber:Jonathan", "Steven Sanders.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanders:Steven", "Darren Leigh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leigh:Darren", "Daniel Wigdor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigdor:Daniel"], "pages": 13}
