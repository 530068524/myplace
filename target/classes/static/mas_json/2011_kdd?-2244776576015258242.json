{"title": "Enabling fast prediction for ensemble models on data streams.", "fields": ["concept drift", "ensemble learning", "ensemble forecasting", "data stream mining", "spatial database"], "abstract": "Ensemble learning has become a common tool for data stream classification, being able to handle large volumes of stream data and concept drifting. Previous studies focus on building accurate prediction models from stream data. However, a linear scan of a large number of base classifiers in the ensemble during prediction incurs significant costs in response time, preventing ensemble learning from being practical for many real world time-critical data stream applications, such as Web traffic stream monitoring, spam detection, and intrusion detection. In these applications, data streams usually arrive at a speed of GB/second, and it is necessary to classify each stream record in a timely manner. To address this problem, we propose a novel  Ensemble-tree  (E-tree for short) indexing structure to organize all base classifiers in an ensemble for fast prediction. On one hand, E-trees treat ensembles as spatial databases and employ an  R-tree  like height-balanced structure to reduce the expected prediction time from linear to sub-linear complexity. On the other hand, E-trees can automatically update themselves by continuously integrating new classifiers and discarding outdated ones, well adapting to new trends and patterns underneath data streams. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate the performance of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Texas State University", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "authors": ["Peng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Peng", "Jun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0016:Jun", "Peng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0028:Peng", "Byron J.
