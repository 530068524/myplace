{"title": "Enhance & explore: an adaptive algorithm to maximize the utility of wireless networks.", "fields": ["wireless mesh network", "wireless network", "network congestion", "testbed", "adaptive algorithm"], "abstract": "The goal of jointly providing efficiency and fairness in wireless networks can be seen as the problem of maximizing a given utility function. In contrast with wired networks, the capacity of wireless networks is typically time-varying and not known explicitly. Hence, as the capacity region is impossible to know or measure exactly, existing scheduling schemes either under-estimate it and are too conservative, or they over-estimate it and suffer from congestion collapse. We propose a new adaptive algorithm, called Enhance & Explore (E&E). It maximizes the utility of the network without requiring any explicit characterization of the capacity region. E&E works above the MAC layer and it does not demand any modification to the existing networking stack. We first evaluate our algorithm theoretically and we prove that it converges to a state of optimal utility. We then evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a WLAN setting, using both simulations and real measurements on a testbed composed of IEEE 802.11 wireless routers.   Finally, we investigate a wireless mesh network setting and we find that, when coupled with an efficientmechanismfor congestioncontrol, the E&E algorithm greatly increases the utility achieved by multi-hop networks as well.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Deutsche Telekom", "Heriot-Watt University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Adel Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz:Adel", "Julien Herzen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herzen:Julien", "Ruben Merz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Merz:Ruben", "Seva Shneer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shneer:Seva", "Patrick Thiran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thiran:Patrick"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
