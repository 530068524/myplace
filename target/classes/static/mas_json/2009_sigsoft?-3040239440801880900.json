This is required for quality assurance purposes. Currently several approaches exist to monitor standard and timing properties. However, a current challenge is to provide a comprehensive approach for monitoring probabilistic properties, as they are used to formulate performance, reliability, safety, and availability requirements. The main problem of these probabilistic properties is that there is no binary acceptance condition. To overcome this problem, this paper describes a monitoring approach called ProMo that is based on acceptance sampling and sequential hypothesis testing. This approach is validated based on several experiments that have been performed on an example system which provides medical assistance in remote areas.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Swinburne University of Technology", "Southeast University"], "authors": ["Lars Grunske.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grunske:Lars", "Pengcheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Pengcheng"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
