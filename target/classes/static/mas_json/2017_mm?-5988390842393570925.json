{"title": "NUBOMEDIA: The First Open Source WebRTC PaaS.", "fields": ["interactive media", "cloud computing", "computer engineering", "webrtc", "application programming interface"], "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce NUBOMEDIA, an open source elastic cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) specifically designed for real-time interactive multimedia and WebRTC services. NUBOMEDIA exposes its capabilities through simple Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), making possible to deploy and execute developers' applications. To that aim, NUBOMEDIA combines the simplicity and ease of development of API services with the flexibility of PaaS infrastructures. Once an application is implemented, developers just need to deploy it on top of NUBOMEDIA providing elasticity as a service and reliable communication.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["King Juan Carlos University", "King Juan Carlos University", "King Juan Carlos University", "King Juan Carlos University", "Technical University of Berlin"], "authors": ["Boni Garc\u00eda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garc=iacute=a:Boni", "Luis L\u00f3pez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=oacute=pez:Luis", "Francisco Gort\u00e1zar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gort=aacute=zar:Francisco", "Micael Gallego.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gallego:Micael", "Giuseppe Antonio Carella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carella:Giuseppe_Antonio"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
