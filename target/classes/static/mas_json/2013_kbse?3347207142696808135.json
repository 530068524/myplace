They are, however, often missing in practice. Thus, specification mining was proposed to tackle this problem. Existing work either focuses on learning simple behavioral models such as finite-state automata, or relies on techniques (e.g., symbolic execution) to infer finite-state machines equipped with data states, referred to as  stateful typestates . The former is often inadequate as finite-state automata lack expressiveness in capturing behaviors of data-rich programs, whereas the latter is often not scalable. In this work, we propose a fully automated approach to learn stateful typestates by extending the classic active learning process to generate transition guards (i.e., propositions on data states). The proposed approach has been implemented in a tool called TzuYu and evaluated against a number of Java classes. The evaluation results show that TzuYu is capable of learning correct stateful typestates more efficiently.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Nanyang Technological University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Hao Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Hao", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Yang", "Shang-Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Shang=Wei", "Chengnian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Chengnian"], "pages": 11}
