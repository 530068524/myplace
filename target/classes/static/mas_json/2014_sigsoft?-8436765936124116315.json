Unfortunately, developers sometimes feel frustrated when they cannot easily obtain the particular information they need for a given task; furthermore, the constant influx of new data \u2014 the vast majority of which is irrelevant to their task at hand \u2014 may result in issues being \"dropped on the floor\". In this paper, we present a developer-centric approach to issue tracking that aims to reduce information overload and improve developers' situational awareness. Our approach is motivated by a grounded theory study of developer comments, which suggests that customized views of a project's repositories that are tailored to developer-specific tasks can help developers better track their progress and understand the surrounding technical context. From the qualitative study, we uncovered a model of the kinds of information elements that are essential for developers in completing their daily tasks, and from this model we built a tool organized around customized issue-tracking dashboards. Further quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrated that this dashboard-like approach to issue tracking can reduce the volume of irrelevant emails by over 99% and also improve support for specific issue-tracking tasks.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Olga Baysal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baysal:Olga", "Reid Holmes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holmes:Reid", "Michael W.
