Existing research into the properties of different notification modalities have used younger participants rather than members of the older population at which they are aimed. This paper presents the results of a user study with older adults that examined how different notification modalities affected ( a ) performance in a card matching game and ( b ) how effective the different modalities were at delivering information. Participants were all aged over 50 and notifications were delivered using textual, pictographic, abstract visual, speech, Earcon, Auditory Icon, tactile and olfactory modalities while playing the game. The results showed that older users were influenced by the same factors as younger users, yet there were subjective differences. The implications for the design of multimodal reminder systems for home care are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "authors": ["David Warnock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Warnock:David", "Marilyn Rose McGee-Lennon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGee=Lennon:Marilyn_Rose", "Stephen A.
