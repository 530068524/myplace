As a result, previous work, which optimizes either for input or output, stands ineffective for load balancing. To that end, we propose a multi-stage load-balancing algorithm which considers the properties of both input and output data through sampling of the original join matrix. To do this efficiently, we propose a novel category of equi-weight histograms. To build them, we exploit state-of-the-art computational geometry algorithms for rectangle tiling. To our knowledge, we are the first to employ tiling algorithms for join load-balancing. In addition, we propose a novel, join-specialized tiling algorithm that has drastically lower time and space complexity than existing algorithms. Experiments show that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by up to a factor of 15.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Aleksandar Vitorovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitorovic:Aleksandar", "Mohammed Elseidy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elseidy:Mohammed", "Christoph Koch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koch_0001:Christoph"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
