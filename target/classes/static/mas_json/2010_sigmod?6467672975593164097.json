In this paper we study this problem in the context of fuzzy objects that have indeterministic boundaries. Fuzzy objects play an important role in many areas, such as biomedical image databases and GIS. Existing research on fuzzy objects mainly focuses on modelling basic fuzzy object types and operations, leaving the processing of more advanced queries such as kNN query untouched. In this paper, we propose two new kinds of kNN queries for fuzzy objects,  Ad-hoc kNN query  (AKNN) and  Range kNN query  (RKNN), to find the  k  nearest objects qualifying at a probability threshold or within a probability range. For efficient AKNN query processing, we optimize the basic best-first search algorithm by deriving more accurate approximations for the distance function between fuzzy objects and the query object. To improve the performance of RKNN search, effective pruning rules are developed to significantly reduce the search space and further speed up the candidate refinement process. The efficiency of our proposed algorithms as well as the optimization techniques are verified with an extensive set of experiments using both synthetic and real datasets.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kai Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0001:Kai", "Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fung:Gabriel_Pui_Cheong", "Xiaofang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiaofang"], "pages": 12}
