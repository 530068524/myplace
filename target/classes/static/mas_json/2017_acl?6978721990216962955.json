Our approach uses a recursive neural network and a newly proposed attention mechanism to compute a representation of the text that focuses on salient content, from the perspective of both RST and the task. Experiments consider variants of the approach and illustrate its strengths and weaknesses.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Pittsburgh"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yangfeng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Yangfeng", "Noah A.
