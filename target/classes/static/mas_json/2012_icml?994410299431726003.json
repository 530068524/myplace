We show how this yields a better exact cluster recovery guarantee than previously suggested nuclear-norm relaxation, and study the effectiveness of our method, and other related convex relaxations, compared to other approaches.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "authors": ["Ali Jalali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jalali:Ali", "Nathan Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nathan"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
