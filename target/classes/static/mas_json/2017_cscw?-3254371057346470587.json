In this paper we show how we carried out a usability engineering effort in the \"wild\" context of the Congolese rainforest -- designing, evaluating and iteratively improving novel collaborative data collection interfaces for non-literate forest communities that can subsequently be used to facilitate communication and information sharing with logging companies. Working in this context necessitates adopting a thoroughly flexible approach to the design, development, introduction and evaluation of technology and the modes of interaction it offers. We show that we have improved participant accuracy from about 75% towards 95% and provide a set of guidelines for designing and evaluating ICT solutions in \"extreme circumstances\" -- which hold lessons for CSCW, HCI and ICT4D practitioners dealing with similar challenges.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Michalis Vitos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitos:Michalis", "Julia Altenbuchner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altenbuchner:Julia", "Matthias Stevens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stevens:Matthias", "Gillian Conquest.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conquest:Gillian", "Jerome Lewis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lewis:Jerome", "Muki Haklay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haklay:Muki"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 15}
