{"title": "Implied Set Closure and Its Application to Memory Consistency Verification.", "fields": ["release consistency", "local consistency", "pram consistency", "causal consistency", "sequential consistency"], "abstract": "Hangal et. al. [3] have developed a procedure to check if an instance of the execution of a shared memory multiprocessor program, is consistent with the Total Store Order (TSO) memory consistency model. They also devised an algorithm based on this procedure with time complexity  O ( n 5), where  n is the total number of instructions in the program. Roy et. al. [6] have improved the implementation of the procedure and achieved  O ( n 4) time complexity.\n\nWe have identified the bottleneck in these algorithms as a graph problem of independent interest, called  implied-set closure (ISC) problem. In this paper we propose an algorithm for ISC problem and show that using this algorithm, Hangal's consistency checking procedure can be implemented with  O ( n 3) time complexity. We also experimentally show that the new algorithm is significantly faster than Roy's algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Surender Baswana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baswana:Surender", "Shashank K.
