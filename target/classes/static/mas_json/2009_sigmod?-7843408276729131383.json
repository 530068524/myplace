{"title": "Cost based plan selection for xpath.", "fields": ["xpath", "implementation", "physical data model", "selection algorithm", "query plan"], "abstract": "We present a complete XPath cost-based optimization and execution framework and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency for a variety of queries and datasets. The framework is based on a logical XPath algebra with novel features and operators and a comprehensive set of rewriting rules that together enable us to algebraically capture many existing and novel processing strategies for XPath queries. An important part of the framework is PSA, a very efficient cost-based plan selection algorithm for XPath queries. In the presented experimental evaluation, PSA picked the cheapest estimated query plan in 100% of the cases. Our cost-based query optimizer independent of the underlying physical data model and storage system and of the available logical operator implementations, depending on a set of well-defined APIs. We also present an implementation of those APIs, including primitive access methods, a large pool of physical operators, statistics estimators and cost models, and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our end-to-end query optimization system.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Athens University of Economics and Business", "Athens University of Economics and Business", "Athens University of Economics and Business"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Haris Georgiadis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Georgiadis:Haris", "Minas Charalambides.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charalambides:Minas", "Vasilis Vassalos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vassalos:Vasilis"], "pages": 12}
