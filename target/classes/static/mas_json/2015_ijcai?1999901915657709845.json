{"title": "Anytime Inference in Probabilistic Logic Programs with Tp-Compilation.", "fields": ["propositional formula", "knowledge compilation", "approximate inference", "anytime algorithm", "probabilistic logic network"], "abstract": "Existing techniques for inference in probabilistic logic programs are sequential: they first compute the relevant propositional formula for the query of interest, then compile it into a tractable target representation and finally, perform weighted model counting on the resulting representation. We propose TP-compilation, a new inference technique based on forward reasoning. TP-compilation proceeds incrementally in that it interleaves the knowledge compilation step for weighted model counting with forward reasoning on the logic program. This leads to a novel anytime algorithm that provides hard bounds on the inferred probabilities. Furthermore, an empirical evaluation shows that TP- compilation effectively handles larger instances of complex real-world problems than current sequential approaches, both for exact and for anytime approximate inference.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Jonas Vlasselaer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vlasselaer:Jonas", "Guy Van den Broeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broeck:Guy_Van_den", "Angelika Kimmig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimmig:Angelika", "Wannes Meert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meert:Wannes", "Luc De Raedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raedt:Luc_De"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
