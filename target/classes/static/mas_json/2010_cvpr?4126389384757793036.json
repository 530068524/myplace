Related methods involving learning of patterns of activity rely on trajectories obtained from object detection and tracking systems, which are unreliable in complex scenes of crowded motion. We propose a mixture model representation of salient patterns of optical flow, and present an algorithm for learning these patterns from dense optical flow in a hierarchical, unsupervised fashion. Using low level cues of noisy optical flow, K-means is employed to initialize a Gaussian mixture model for temporally segmented clips of video. The components of this mixture are then filtered and instances of motion patterns are computed using a simple motion model, by linking components across space and time. Motion patterns are then initialized and membership of instances in different motion patterns is established by using KL divergence between mixture distributions of pattern instances. Finally, a pixel level representation of motion patterns is proposed by deriving conditional expectation of optical flow. Results of extensive experiments are presented for multiple surveillance sequences containing numerous patterns involving both pedestrian and vehicular traffic.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Central Florida"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Imran Saleemi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saleemi:Imran", "Lance Hartung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartung:Lance", "Mubarak Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Mubarak"], "pages": 8}
