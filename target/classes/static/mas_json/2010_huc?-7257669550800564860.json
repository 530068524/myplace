{"title": "Groupthink: usability of secure group association for wireless devices.", "fields": ["usability inspection", "web usability", "cognitive walkthrough", "usability goals", "pluralistic walkthrough"], "abstract": "A fairly common modern setting entails users, each in possession of a personal wireless device, wanting to communicate securely, via their devices. If these users (and their devices) have no prior association, a new security context must be established. In order to prevent potential attacks, the initial context (association) establishment process must involve only the intended devices and their users.   A number of methods for initial secure association of  two  devices have been proposed; their usability factors have been explored and compared extensively. However, a more challenging problem of initial secure association of a  group  of devices (and users) has not received much attention. Although a few secure group association methods have been proposed, their usability aspects have not been studied, especially, in a comparative manner. This paper discusses desirable features and evaluation criteria for secure group association, identifies suitable methods and presents a comparative usability study. Results show that some simple methods (e.g., peer- or leader-based number comparisons) are quite attractive for small groups, being fast, reasonably secure and well-received by users.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "New York University", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Rishab Nithyanand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nithyanand:Rishab", "Nitesh Saxena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saxena:Nitesh", "Gene Tsudik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsudik:Gene", "Ersin Uzun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uzun:Ersin"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
