{"title": "Partially intelligent automobiles and driving experience at the moment of system transition.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "speaker recognition", "user interface", "situation awareness", "automation"], "abstract": "The current study (N = 49) took a user-centered approach to explore how level of automation (pedal automated, wheel automated or fully automated driving) and the interface modality (switching automation on or off via touch or voice control) in automated vehicles influence drivers' perceived experience and performance. The results found that full or wheel automation in vehicles was perceived significantly more intelligent than pedal automation. Furthermore, drivers in the pedal automation condition reported greater nervousness when using the touch interface than the voice interface. This tendency was not found among drivers in the full and wheel automation conditions. Drivers who used the voice interface to control automated driving had fewer driving mistakes than those who operated the touch interface. Our findings have important psychological and practical implications for designing a user interface for automated vehicles.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Key Jung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Key_Jung", "Yeon Kyoung Joo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joo:Yeon_Kyoung", "Clifford Nass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nass:Clifford"], "pages": 4}
