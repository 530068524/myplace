Unlike the previous approaches relying on the \u201csymmetry\u201d found in parallel corpora, the proposed method is tolerant to asymmetry often found in comparable corpora, by distinguishing different semantics of relations of entity pairs to selectively propagate seed entity translations on weakly comparable corpora. Our experimental results on English-Chinese corpora show that our selective propagation approach outperforms the previous approaches in named entity translation in terms of the mean reciprocal rank by up to 0.16 for organization names, and 0.14 in a low comparability case.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Taesung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Taesung", "Seung-won Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Seung=won"], "pages": 10}
