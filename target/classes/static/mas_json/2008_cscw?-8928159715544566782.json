We collected data from a geographically distributed software development project covering 39 months of activity. Our analysis showed that over time a group of developers emerge as the liaisons between formal teams and geographical locations. In addition to handling the communication and coordination load across teams and locations, those engineers contributed the most to the development effort.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "departments": ["Bosch", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Marcelo Cataldo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cataldo:Marcelo", "James D.
