{"title": "Ally Friendly Jamming: How to Jam Your Enemy and Maintain Your Own Wireless Connectivity at the Same Time.", "fields": ["near far problem", "adversary", "jamming", "fixed wireless", "wi fi array"], "abstract": "This paper presents a novel mechanism, called Ally Friendly Jamming, which aims at providing an intelligent jamming capability that can disable unauthorized (enemy) wireless communication but at the same time still allow authorized wireless devices to communicate, even if all these devices operate at the same frequency. The basic idea is to jam the wireless channel continuously but properly control the jamming signals with secret keys, so that the jamming signals are unpredictable interference to unauthorized devices, but are recoverable by authorized ones equipped with the secret keys. To achieve the ally friendly jamming capability, we develop new techniques to generate ally jamming signals, to identify and synchronize with multiple ally jammers. This paper also reports the analysis, implementation, and experimental evaluation of ally friendly jamming on a software defined radio platform. Both the analytical and experimental results indicate that the proposed techniques can effectively disable enemy wireless communication and at the same time maintain wireless communication between authorized devices.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Wenbo Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Wenbo", "Peng Ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ning:Peng", "Xiaofan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaofan", "Huaiyu Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Huaiyu"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2013", "pages": 15}
