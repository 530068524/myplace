Emoticons are strings of symbols widely used in text-based online communication to convey emotions. It extracts emoticons from input and determines specific emotions they express. Firstly, by matching the extracted emoticons to a raw emoticon database, containing over ten thousand emoticon samples extracted from the Web and annotated automatically. The emoticons for which emotion types could not be determined using only this database, are automatically divided into semantic areas representing \"mouths\" or \"eyes\", based on the theory of kinesics. The areas are automatically annotated according to their co-occurrence in the database. The annotation is firstly based on the eye-mouth-eye triplet, and if no such triplet is found, all semantic areas are estimated separately. This provides the system coverage exceeding 3 million possibilities. The evaluation, performed on both training and test sets, confirmed the system's capability to sufficiently detect and extract any emoticon, analyze its semantic structure and estimate the potential emotion types expressed. The system achieved nearly ideal scores, outperforming existing emoticon analysis systems.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Hokkaido University", "Hokkaido University", "Hokkaido University", "Hokkaido University", "Hokkaido University"], "authors": ["Michal Ptaszynski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ptaszynski:Michal", "Jacek Maciejewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maciejewski:Jacek", "Pawel Dybala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dybala:Pawel", "Rafal Rzepka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rzepka:Rafal", "Kenji Araki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Araki:Kenji"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
