In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Dual Projected Newton Method (DPNM) to solve the l1-regularized least squares problem. In DPNM, we first derive a new dual problem as a box constrained quadratic programming. Then, a projected Newton method is utilized to solve the dual problem, achieving a quadratic convergence rate. Moreover, we propose to utilize some practical techniques, thus it greatly reduces the computational cost and makes DPNM more efficient. Experimental results on six real-world data sets indicate that DPNM is very efficient for solving the l1-regularized least squares problem, by comparing it with state of the art methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Pinghua Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Pinghua", "Changshui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Changshui"], "pages": 6}
