We show that LMC allows to sample in polynomial time from a posterior distribution restricted to a convex body and with concave log-likelihood. This gives the first Markov chain to sample from a log-concave distribution with a first-order oracle, as the existing chains with provable guarantees (lattice walk, ball walk and hit-and-run) require a zeroth-order oracle. Our proof uses elementary concepts from stochastic calculus which could be useful more generally to understand SGD and its variants.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Paris Dauphine University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["S\u00e9bastien Bubeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bubeck:S=eacute=bastien", "Ronen Eldan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eldan:Ronen", "Joseph Lehec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehec:Joseph"], "pages": 9}
