Search time can be significantly reduced if it is known which parts of the graph include \"swamps\"\u2014areas that cannot lie on the only available shortest path, and can thus safely be pruned during search. We introduce an algorithm for detecting hierarchies of swamps, and exploiting them. Experiments support our claims of improved efficiency, showing significant reduction in search time.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Nir Pochter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pochter:Nir", "Aviv Zohar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zohar:Aviv", "Jeffrey S.
