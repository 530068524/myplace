{"title": "Directed spanners via flow-based linear programs.", "fields": ["linear programming relaxation", "rounding", "special case", "vertex", "sublinear function"], "abstract": "We examine directed spanners through flow-based linear programming relaxations. We design an ~O(n 2/3 )-approximation algorithm for the directed k-spanner problem that works for all k \u2265 1, which is the first sublinear approximation for arbitrary edge-lengths. Even in the more restricted setting of unit edge-lengths, our algorithm improves over the previous ~O(n 1-1/k ) approximation [BGJRW09] when k \u2265 4. For the special case of k=3 we design a different algorithm achieving an ~O(\u221an)-approximation, improving the previous ~O(n 2/3 ) [EP05,BGJRW09] (independently of our work, an ~O(n 1-1/\u2308 k/2\u2309 ) was recently devised [BRR10]). Both of our algorithms easily extend to the  fault-tolerant  setting, which has recently attracted attention but not from an approximation viewpoint. We also prove a nearly matching integrality gap of ~\u03a9(n 1/3 - e ) for every constant e > 0. A virtue of all our algorithms is that they are relatively simple. Technically, we introduce a new yet natural flow-based relaxation, and show how to approximately solve it even when its size is not polynomial. The main challenge is to design a rounding scheme that \"coordinates\" the choices of flow-paths between the many demand pairs while using few edges overall. We achieve this, roughly speaking, by randomization at the level of  vertices .", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Michael Dinitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinitz:Michael", "Robert Krauthgamer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krauthgamer:Robert"], "pages": 10}
