This technique, however, bounds the maximum hit rate due to the large fraction of singleton queries, which is an important limitation. In this paper we propose  ResIn  - an architecture that uses a combination of  res ults caching and  in dex pruning to overcome this limitation.   We argue that results caching is an inexpensive and efficient way to reduce the query processing load and show that it is cheaper to implement compared to a pruned index. At the same time, we show that index pruning performance is fundamentally affected by the changes in the query traffic that the results cache induces. We experiment with real query logs and a large document collection, and show that the combination of both techniques enables efficient reduction of the query processing costs and thus is practical to use in Web search engines.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Gleb Skobeltsyn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skobeltsyn:Gleb", "Flavio Junqueira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Junqueira:Flavio", "Vassilis Plachouras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plachouras:Vassilis", "Ricardo A.
