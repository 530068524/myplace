Security notions of this kind are currently known to be realizable only under strong and specific hardness assumptions. A key element in our construction is a commitment scheme that satisfies a new and strong notion of security. The notion, security against chosen-commitment-attacks (CCA security), means that security holds even if the attacker has access to a {\\em extraction oracle} that gives the adversary decommitment information to commitments of the adversary's choice. This notion is stronger than concurrent non-malleability and is of independent interest. We construct CCA-secure commitments based on standard one-way functions, and with no trusted set-up. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first construction of a natural cryptographic primitive requiring \\emph{adaptive hardness} from standard hardness assumptions, using no trusted set-up or public keys.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Ran Canetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canetti:Ran", "Huijia Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Huijia", "Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael"], "pages": 10}
