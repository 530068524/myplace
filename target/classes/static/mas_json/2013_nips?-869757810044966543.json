FAB inference has not been applicable to models, including LFMs, without a specific condition on the Hessian matrix of a complete log-likelihood, which is required to derive a \"factorized information criterion\" (FIC). Our asymptotic analysis of the Hessian matrix of LFMs shows that FIC of LFMs has the same form as those of mixture models. FAB/LFMs have several desirable properties (e.g., automatic hidden states selection and parameter identifiability) and empirically perform better than state-of-the-art Indian Buffet processes in terms of model selection, prediction, and computational efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics", "NEC Laboratories America"], "authors": ["Kohei Hayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayashi:Kohei", "Ryohei Fujimaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujimaki:Ryohei"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
