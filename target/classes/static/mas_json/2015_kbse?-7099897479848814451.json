{"title": "MetaMod: A Modeling Formalism with Modularity at Its Core.", "fields": ["object oriented modeling", "formalism", "modularity", "bootstrapping", "model driven architecture"], "abstract": "Because modern engineering products require more and more functionality, the models used in the design of these products get larger and more complex. A way to handle this complexity would be a suitable mechanism to modularize models. However, current approaches in the Model Driven Engineering field have limited support for modularity. This is the gap that our research addresses. We want to tackle the gap by designing and creating a modeling formalism with modularity at its core - MetaMod. We are including the modeling formalism into a prototype such that we can experiment with it. Our evaluation plan includes bootstrapping MetaMod (defining MetaMod in MetaMod) and creating an industrial DSL in MetaMod.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology"], "authors": ["Ana-Maria Sut\u00eei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sut=icirc=i:Ana=Maria"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
