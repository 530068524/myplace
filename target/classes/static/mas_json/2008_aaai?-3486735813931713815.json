So far, most results concern hyperequivalence relative to the stable-model semantics. However, other semantics for logic programs are also of interest, especially the semantics of supported models which, when properly generalized, is closely related to the autoepistemic logic of Moore. In this paper, we consider a family of hyperequivalence relations for programs based on the semantics of supported and supported minimal models. We characterize these relations in model-theoretic terms. We use the characterizations to derive complexity results concerning testing whether two programs are hyperequivalent relative to supported and supported minimal models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Kentucky", "Vienna University of Technology", "University of Kentucky", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Miroslaw Truszczynski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Truszczynski:Miroslaw", "Stefan Woltran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woltran:Stefan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
