However, the appropriate design of this interaction is still an open question, with competing approaches such as spatially-aware vs. spatially-agnostic techniques. In this paper, we present the results of a two-phase user study that explores this design space: In phase 1, we elicited gestures for typical mobile cross-device tasks from 4 focus groups (N=17). The results show that 71% of the elicited gestures were spatially-aware and that participants strongly associated cross-device tasks with interacting and thinking in space. In phase 2, we implemented one spatially-agnostic and two spatially-aware techniques from phase 1 and compared them in a controlled experiment (N=12). The results indicate that spatially-aware techniques are preferred by users and can decrease mental demand, effort, and frustration, but only when they are designed with great care. We conclude with a summary of findings to inform the design of future cross-device interactions.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Konstanz", "University College London", "University of Konstanz", "University College London", "University of Konstanz"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Roman R\u00e4dle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=dle:Roman", "Hans-Christian Jetter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jetter:Hans=Christian", "Mario Schreiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schreiner:Mario", "Zhihao Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhihao", "Harald Reiterer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reiterer:Harald", "Yvonne Rogers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogers:Yvonne"], "pages": 10}
