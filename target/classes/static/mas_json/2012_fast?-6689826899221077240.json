{"title": "Reducing SSD read latency via NAND flash program and erase suspension.", "fields": ["flash memory", "latency", "nand gate", "fifo", "wait"], "abstract": "In NAND flash memory, once a page program or block erase (P/E) command is issued to a NAND flash chip, the subsequent read requests have to wait until the time-consuming P/E operation to complete. Preliminary results show that the lengthy P/E operations may increase the read latency by 2x on average. As NAND flash-based SSDs enter the enterprise server storage, this increased read latency caused by the contention may significantly degrade the overall system performance. Inspired by the internal mechanism of NAND flash P/E algorithms, we propose in this paper a low-overhead P/E suspension scheme, which suspends the on-going P/E to service pending reads and resumes the suspended P/E afterwards. In our experiments, we simulate a realistic SSD model that adopts multi-chip/channel and evaluate both SLC and MLC NAND flash as storage materials of diverse performance. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves a near-optimal performance gain on servicing read requests. Specifically, the read latency is reduced on average by 50.5% compared to RPS and 75.4% compared to FIFO at cost of less than 4% overhead on write requests.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Virginia Commonwealth University", "Virginia Commonwealth University"], "authors": ["Guanying Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Guanying", "Xubin He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xubin"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2012", "pages": 1}
