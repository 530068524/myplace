{"title": "Tag transformer.", "fields": ["data mining", "categorization", "information retrieval", "computer science", "schema"], "abstract": "Human annotations (titles and tags) of web videos facilitate most web video applications. However, the raw tags are noisy, sparse and structureless, which limit the effectiveness of tags. In this paper, we propose a tag transformer schema to solve these problems. We first eliminate those imprecise and meaningless tags with Wikipedia, and then transform the remaining tags to the Wikipedia category set to gather a precise, complete and structural description of the tags. Our experimental results on web video categorization demonstrate the superiority of the transformed space. We also apply tag transformer into the first study of using Wikipedia category system to structurally recommend the related videos. The online user study of the demo system suggests that our method could bring fantastic experience to the web users.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Yicheng Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yicheng", "Juan Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Juan", "Zhineng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhineng", "Yongdong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yongdong", "Jintao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jintao"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
