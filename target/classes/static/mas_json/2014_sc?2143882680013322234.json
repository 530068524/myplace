{"title": "Two-Choice Randomized Dynamic I/O Scheduler for Object Storage Systems.", "fields": ["small number", "i o scheduling", "object storage", "scalability", "server"], "abstract": "Object storage is considered a promising solution for next-generation (exascale) high-performance computing platform because of its flexible and high-performance object interface. However, delivering high burst-write throughput is still a critical challenge. Although deploying more storage servers can potentially provide higher throughput, it can be ineffective because the burst-write throughput can be limited by a small number of  stragglers  (storage servers that are occasionally slower than others). In this paper, we propose a  two-choice randomized dynamic I/O scheduler  that schedules the concurrent burst-write operations in a balanced way to avoid stragglers and hence achieve high throughput. The contributions in this study are threefold. First, we propose a two-choice randomized dynamic I/O scheduler with  collaborative probe  and  preassign  strategies. Second, we design and implement a  redirect table  and  metadata maintainer  to address the metadata management challenge introduced by dynamic I/O scheduling. Third, we evaluate the proposed scheduler with both simulation tests and experimental tests in an HPC cluster. The evaluation results confirm the scalability and performance benefits of the proposed I/O scheduler.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Texas Tech University", "Texas Tech University", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Dong Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Dong", "Yong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Yong", "Dries Kimpe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimpe:Dries", "Robert B.
