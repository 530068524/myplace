{"title": "Garbled RAM Revisited.", "fields": ["electronic circuit", "computer science", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "The notion of garbled random-access machines (garbled RAMs) was introduced by Lu and Ostrovsky (Eurocrypt 2013). It can be seen as an analogue of Yao\u2019s garbled circuits, that allows a user to garble a RAM program directly, without performing the expensive step of converting it into a circuit. In particular, the size of the garbled program and the time it takes to create and evaluate it are only proportional to its running time on a RAM rather than its circuit size. Lu and Ostrovsky gave a candidate construction of this primitive based on pseudo-random functions (PRFs).", "citation": "Citations (83)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "SRI, USA"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Craig Gentry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentry:Craig", "Shai Halevi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halevi:Shai", "Steve Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Steve", "Rafail Ostrovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostrovsky:Rafail", "Mariana Raykova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raykova_0001:Mariana", "Daniel Wichs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wichs:Daniel"], "pages": 18}
