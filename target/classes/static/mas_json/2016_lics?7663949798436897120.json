While the forward implication is a classic fact known as Courcelle's theorem, the converse direction remained open.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Mikolaj Bojanczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bojanczyk:Mikolaj", "Michal Pilipczuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilipczuk:Michal"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
