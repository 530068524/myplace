It is an extension of Veksler's [25] star-convexity prior, in two ways: from a single star to multiple stars and from Euclidean rays to Geodesic paths. Global minima of the energy function are obtained subject to these new constraints. We also introduce Geodesic Forests, which exploit the structure of shortest paths in implementing the extended constraints. The star-convexity prior is used here in an interactive setting and this is demonstrated in a practical system. The system is evaluated by means of a \u201crobot user\u201d to measure the amount of interaction required in a precise way. We also introduce a new and harder dataset which augments the existing Grabcut dataset [1] with images and ground truth taken from the PASCAL VOC segmentation challenge [7].", "citation": "Citations (294)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Varun Gulshan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gulshan:Varun", "Carsten Rother.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rother:Carsten", "Antonio Criminisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Criminisi:Antonio", "Andrew Blake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blake_0001:Andrew", "Andrew Zisserman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zisserman:Andrew"], "pages": 8}
