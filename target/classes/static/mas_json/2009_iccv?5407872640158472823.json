The contribution of this paper is to propose an algorithm which allows to minimize a convex relaxation of the Mumford-Shah functional obtained by functional lifting. The algorithm is an efficient primal-dual projection algorithm for which we prove convergence. In contrast to existing algorithms for minimizing the full Mumford-Shah this is the first one which is based on a convex relaxation. As a consequence the computed solutions are independent of the initialization. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm determines smooth approximations while preserving discontinuities of the underlying signal.", "citation": "Citations (314)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "University of Bonn", "Graz University of Technology", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Thomas Pock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pock:Thomas", "Daniel Cremers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cremers:Daniel", "Horst Bischof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischof:Horst", "Antonin Chambolle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chambolle:Antonin"], "pages": 8}
