Among others, if p-Halt is in para-AC0, the parameterized version of the circuit complexity class AC0, then AC0, or equivalently, (+, x)-invariant FO, has a logic. Although it is widely believed that p-Halt \u2209. para-AC0, we show that the problem is hard to settle by establishing a connection to the question in classical complexity of whether NE n LINH. Here, LINH denotes the linear time hierarchy.   On the other hand, we suggest an approach toward proving NE n LINH using bounded arithmetic. More specifically, we demonstrate that if the much celebrated MRDP (for Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam) theorem can be proved in a certain fragment of arithmetic, then NE n LINH. Interestingly, central to this result is a para-AC0 lower bound for the parameterized model-checking problem for FO on arithmetical structures.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Yijia Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yijia", "Moritz M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Moritz", "Keita Yokoyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yokoyama:Keita"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
