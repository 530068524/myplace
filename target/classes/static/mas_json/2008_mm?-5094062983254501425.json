Using state of the art computer vision and graphics technologies and effective UI design, the interactive tool can quickly generate a personalized cartoon storyboard, which naturally blends a real face chosen from the family photo album into a cartoon picture. The personalized cartoon image is easily and quickly obtained in two main steps. First, the best face candidate is selected from the album interactively. Then a personalized cartoon image is automatically synthesized by blending the selected face into the interesting cartoon image. Experiments show that most users express great interest in our system. Without any art background, they can make a personalized cartoon of high quality using the EasyToon within minutes.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Shifeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shifeng", "Yuandong Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Yuandong", "Fang Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Fang", "Ying-Qing Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ying=Qing", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
