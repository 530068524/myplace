However, the shortage of non-interfering channels makes it a challenge for WLANs to efficiently support real-time multicast services. In this paper, we study the problem of efficient scheduling of  real-time   multicast   flows . For mitigating interferences, we allow access-points (APs) to transmit simultaneously only if they are mutually non-interfering and our objective is minimizing the fraction of time used by the APs for servicing the multicast flows. We introduce two multicast strategies, the  association   strategy  for which each user is restricted to receive flows only from its associated AP and the  non-association  strategy for which a user may also decode transmissions from other APs in its vicinity. Under both strategies, the scheduling problem of minimizing the multicast service time is NP-hard and we propose simple approximation algorithms with provable performance bounds. Our simulations clearly demonstrate that the proposed algorithms yield efficient multicast scheduling.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Yigal Bejerano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bejerano:Yigal", "Dongwook Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Dongwook", "Prasun Sinha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinha:Prasun", "Lisa Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lisa"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
