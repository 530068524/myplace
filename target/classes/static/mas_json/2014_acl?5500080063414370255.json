A major challenge for this task is the automatic discovery of such relations. This paper proposes a novel and effective method for the construction of semantic hierarchies based on word embeddings, which can be used to measure the semantic relationship between words. We identify whether a candidate word pair has hypernym\u2010hyponym relation by using the word-embedding-based semantic projections between words and their hypernyms. Our result, an F-score of 73.74%, outperforms the state-of-theart methods on a manually labeled test dataset. Moreover, combining our method with a previous manually-built hierarchy extension method can further improve Fscore to 80.29%.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Baidu"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ruiji Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Ruiji", "Jiang Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jiang", "Bing Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin_0001:Bing", "Wanxiang Che.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Che:Wanxiang", "Haifeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haifeng", "Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ting"], "pages": 11}
