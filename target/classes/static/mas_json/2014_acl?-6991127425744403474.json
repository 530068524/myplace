{"title": "A Constrained Viterbi Relaxation for Bidirectional Word Alignment.", "fields": ["viterbi algorithm", "machine learning", "decoding methods", "artificial intelligence", "sentence"], "abstract": "Bidirectional models of word alignment are an appealing alternative to post-hoc combinations of directional word aligners. Unfortunately, most bidirectional formulations are NP-Hard to solve, and a previous attempt to use a relaxationbased decoder yielded few exact solutions (6%). We present a novel relaxation for decoding the bidirectional model of DeNero and Macherey (2011). The relaxation can be solved with a modified version of the Viterbi algorithm. To find optimal solutions on difficult instances, we alternate between incrementally adding constraints and applying optimality-preserving coarse-to-fine pruning. The algorithm finds provably exact solutions on 86% of sentence pairs and shows improvements over directional models.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Google", "Google", "Columbia University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yin-Wen Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yin=Wen", "Alexander M.
