{"title": "Madeus: Database Live Migration Middleware under Heavy Workloads for Cloud Environment.", "fields": ["concurrency control", "live migration", "multitenancy", "snapshot isolation", "shared resource"], "abstract": "Database-as-a-service has been gaining popularity in cloud computing because multitenant databases can reduce costs by sharing off-the-shelf resources. However, due to heavy workloads, resource sharing often causes a hot spot; one node is overloaded even while others are not. Unfortunately, a hot spot can lead to violation of service level agreements and destroy customer satisfaction. To efficiently address the hot spot problem, we propose a middleware approach called Madeus that conducts database live migration. To make efficient database live migration possible, we also introduce the lazy snapshot isolation rule (LSIR) that enables concurrently propagating syncsets, which are the datasets needed to synchronize slave with master databases. Madeus provides efficient database live migration by implementing the LSIR under snapshot isolation. Unlike current approaches, Madeus is pure middleware that is transparent to the database management system and based on commodity hardware and software. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach over current approaches, we experimentally evaluated Madeus by using PostgreSQL with the TPC-W benchmark. The results indicate that Madeus achieves more efficient live migration than three other types of middleware approaches, especially under heavy workloads; therefore, it can effectively resolve hot spots.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Takeshi Mishima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mishima:Takeshi", "Yasuhiro Fujiwara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujiwara:Yasuhiro"], "pages": 15}
