The advantages of this tool suite are that the graphical user interface (GUI), as well as the application logic can both be developed in a rapid and simple way, and web-based services on the Internet can be integrated into our platform by end-users. This tool suite involves three sub-systems, namely ServiceAccess, EasyApp and LSCE. ServiceAccess takes charge of the registration and management of heterogeneous services, and can export different form of services according to the requirements of the other sub-systems. EasyApp is responsible for developing GUI in the form of mobile app. LSCE takes charge of creating the application logic that can be invoked by mobile app directly. Finally, a development case is presented to illustrate the development process using this tool suite.
