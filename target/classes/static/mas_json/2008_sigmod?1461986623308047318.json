{"title": "Optimizing complex queries with multiple relation instances.", "fields": ["buffer overflow", "relational database management system", "deadlock", "access method", "tuple"], "abstract": "Today's query processing engines do not take advantage of the multiple occurrences of a relation in a query to improve performance. Instead, each instance is treated as a distinct relation and has its own independent table access method. In this paper, we present  MAPLE , a  M ulti-instance- A ware  PL an  E valuation engine that enables multiple instances of a relation to share one physical scan (called  SharedScan ) with limited buffer space. During execution, as  SharedScan  pulls a tuple for  any  instance, that tuple is also pushed to the buffers of other instances with matching predicates. To avoid buffer overflow, a novel  interleaved  execution strategy is proposed: whenever an instance's buffer becomes full, the execution is temporarily switched to a  drainer  (an ancestor blocking operator of the instance) to consume all the tuples in the buffer. Thus, the execution is interleaved between normal processing and drainers. We also propose a cost-based approach to generate a plan to maximize the shared scan benefit as well as to avoid interleaved execution deadlocks.  MAPLE  is light-weight and can be easily integrated into existing RDBMS executors. We have implemented  MAPLE  in PostgreSQL, and our experimental study on the TPC-DS benchmark shows significant reduction in execution time.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yu Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yu", "Gopal C.
