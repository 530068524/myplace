We simply consider the extended multihop network, where a number of wireless nodes  v i  (1 \u2264  i  \u2264  n ) are randomly located in a square region with side-length  a  = \u221a n , by use of Poisson distribution with density 1. All nodes transmit at constant power  P , and the power decays along path, with attenuation exponent \u03b1 > 2. The data rate of a transmission is determined by the SINR as  B  log(1 + SINR). There are  n s   randomly and independently chosen multicast sessions. Each multicast has  k  randomly chosen terminals. We show that, when  k  \u2264 \u03b8 1   n /(log  n ) 2\u03b1+6 , and  n s   \u2265 \u03b8 2  n  1/2+\u03b2 , the capacity that each multicast session can achieve, with high probability, is at least  c  8 \u221a n / n s  \u221a k , where \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 , and  c  8  are some special constants and \u03b2 > 0 is any positive real number. Our result generalizes the unicast capacity [3] for random networks using percolation theory.", "citation": "Citations (110)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "University of Science and Technology, Sana'a", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Shi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shi", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
