{"title": "Estimating High-dimensional Non-Gaussian Multiple Index Models via Stein's Lemma.", "fields": ["stein s lemma", "covariate", "gaussian", "parametric statistics", "truncation"], "abstract": "We consider estimating the parametric components of semiparametric multi-index models in high dimensions. To bypass the requirements of Gaussianity or elliptical symmetry of covariates in existing methods, we propose to leverage a second-order Stein\u2019s method with score function-based corrections. We prove that our estimator achieves a near-optimal statistical rate of convergence even when the score function or the response variable is heavy-tailed. To establish the key concentration results, we develop a data-driven truncation argument that may be of independent interest. We supplement our theoretical findings with simulations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "Tencent"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zhuoran Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhuoran", "Krishnakumar Balasubramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balasubramanian:Krishnakumar", "Zhaoran Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhaoran", "Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Han"], "pages": 10}
