Yet, existing F2F overlays suffer from a low performance, are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, or fail to provide anonymity. In particular, greedy embeddings allow highly efficient communication in arbitrary connectivity-restricted overlays but require communicating parties to reveal their identity. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving routing scheme for greedy embeddings based on anonymous return addresses rather than identifying node coordinates. We show that the return addresses allow plausible deniability. Furthermore, we enhance the routing's resilience by using multiple embeddings and propose a method for efficient content addressing. Our extensive simulation study on real-world data indicates that our approach is highly efficient and effectively mitigates failures as well as powerful denial-of-service attacks.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Stefanie Roos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roos:Stefanie", "Martin Beck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beck:Martin", "Thorsten Strufe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strufe:Thorsten"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
