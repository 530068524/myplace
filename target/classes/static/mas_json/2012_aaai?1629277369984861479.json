Games with imperfect information have recently been added as a new challenge for existing general game-playing systems. The HyperPlay technique presents a solution to this challenge by maintaining a collection of models of the true game as a foundation for reasoning, and move selection. The technique provides existing game players with a bolt-on solution to convert from perfect-information games to imperfect-information games. In this paper we describe the HyperPlay technique, show how it was adapted for use with a Monte Carlo decision making process and give experimental results for its performance.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Michael John Schofield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schofield:Michael_John", "Timothy Joseph Cerexhe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cerexhe:Timothy_Joseph", "Michael Thielscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thielscher:Michael"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
