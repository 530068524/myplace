More structured or form-based social content types are not mainstream but we have started seeing sites evolve that support them. This paper describes the design and use of structured lists in an enterprise social networking system. As a major feature of our shared lists, we introduced the ability to reuse someone else's list. We report the results on the use and reuse of shared lists based on three months of usage data from 285 users and interviews with 9 users. Our findings suggest that despite the structured nature of lists, our users socialize more around lists than photos, and use lists as a medium for self-representation.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Werner Geyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geyer:Werner", "Casey Dugan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dugan:Casey", "Joan Morris DiMicco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DiMicco:Joan_Morris", "David R.
