Though some approaches have advantages over others, the resulting networks are often qualitatively similar. We find that, in dynamically-routed networks trained to classify images, layers and branches become specialized to process distinct categories of images. Additionally, given a fixed computational budget, dynamically-routed networks tend to perform better than comparable statically-routed networks.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Mason McGill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGill:Mason", "Pietro Perona.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perona:Pietro"], "pages": 10}
