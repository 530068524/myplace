{"title": "Universal Design Ballot Interfaces on Voting Performance and Satisfaction of Voters with and without Vision Loss.", "fields": ["bullet voting", "disapproval voting", "ballot", "cardinal voting systems", "electronic voting"], "abstract": "Voting is a glocalized event across countries, states and municipalities in which individuals of all abilities want to participate. To enable people with disabilities to participate accessible voting is typically implemented by adding assistive technologies to electronic voting machines to accommodate people with disabilities. To overcome the complexities and inequities in this practice, two interfaces, EZ Ballot, which uses a linear yes/no input system for all selections, and QUICK Ballot, which provides random access voting through direct selection, were designed to provide one system for all voters. This paper reports efficacy testing of both interfaces. The study demonstrated that voters with a range of visual abilities were able to use both ballots independently. While non-sighted voters made fewer errors on the linear ballot (EZ Ballot), partially-sighted and sighted voters completed the random access ballot (QUICK Ballot) in less time. In addition, a higher percentage of non-sighted participants preferred the linear ballot, and a higher percentage of sighted participants preferred the random ballot.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Seunghyun Tina Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Seunghyun_Tina", "Elaine Yilin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Elaine_Yilin", "Ljilja Ruzic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruzic:Ljilja", "Jon A.
