{"title": "Detecting Common Discussion Topics Across Culture From News Reader Comments.", "fields": ["gibbs sampling", "news aggregator", "probabilistic logic", "semantics", "graphical model"], "abstract": "News reader comments found in many on-line news websites are typically massive in amount. We investigate the task of Cultural-common Topic Detection (CTD), which is aimed at discovering common discussion topics from news reader comments written in different languages. We propose a new probabilistic graphical model called MCTA which can cope with the language gap and capture the common semantics in different languages. We also develop a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler which effectively incorporates the term translation relationship into the detection of cultural-common topics for model parameter learning. Experimental results show improvements over the state-of-the-art model.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Bei Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Bei", "Wai Lam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lam:Wai", "Lidong Bing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bing:Lidong", "Yinqing Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yinqing"], "pages": -1}
