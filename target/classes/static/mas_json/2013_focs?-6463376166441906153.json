{"title": "Three-Player Entangled XOR Games Are NP-Hard to Approximate.", "fields": ["bell s theorem", "hardness of approximation", "correlation inequality", "soundness", "multiplicative function", "quantum pseudo telepathy", "pcp theorem"], "abstract": "We show that for any e > 0 the problem of finding a factor (2 - e) approximation to the entangled value of a three-player XOR game is NP-hard. Equivalently, the problem of approximating the largest possible quantum violation of a tripartite Bell correlation inequality to within any multiplicative constant is NP-hard. These results are the first constant-factor hardness of approximation results for entangled games or quantum violations of Bell inequalities shown under the sole assumption that P\u2260NP. They can be thought of as an extension of Hastad's optimal hardness of approximation results for MAX-E3-LIN2 (JACM'01) to the entangled-player setting. The key technical component of our work is a soundness analysis of a point-vs-plane low-degree test against entangled players. This extends and simplifies the analysis of the multilinearity test by Ito and Vidick (FOCS'12). Our results demonstrate the possibility for efficient reductions between entangled-player games and our techniques may lead to further hardness of approximation results.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Thomas Vidick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidick:Thomas"], "pages": 10}
