In this paper, we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to obtain passive brain sensing data and detect extended periods of boredom or overload. From these physiological signals, we can adapt a simulation in order to optimize workload in real-time, which allows the system to better fit the task to the user from moment to moment. To demonstrate this idea, we ran a laboratory study in which participants performed path planning for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a simulation. Based on their state, we varied the difficulty of the task by adding or removing UAVs and found that we were able to decrease error by 35% over a baseline condition. Our results show that we can use fNIRS brain sensing to detect task difficulty in real-time and construct an interface that improves user performance through dynamic difficulty adjustment.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Tufts University", "Tufts University", "Drexel University", "Tufts University", "Tufts University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Afergan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Afergan:Daniel", "Evan M.
