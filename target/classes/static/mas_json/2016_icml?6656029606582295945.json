{"title": "Tensor Decomposition via Joint Matrix Schur Decomposition.", "fields": ["schur complement", "schur decomposition", "matrix decomposition", "schur complement method", "schur product theorem"], "abstract": "We describe an approach to tensor decomposition that involves extracting a set of observable matrices from the tensor and applying an approximate joint Schur decomposition on those matrices, and we establish the corresponding first-order perturbation bounds. We develop a novel iterative Gauss-Newton algorithm for joint matrix Schur decomposition, which minimizes a nonconvex objective over the manifold of orthogonal matrices, and which is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum under certain conditions. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm is faster and at least as accurate and robust than state-of-the-art algorithms for this problem.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Nicol\u00f2 Colombo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colombo:Nicol=ograve=", "Nikos Vlassis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vlassis:Nikos"], "pages": 9}
