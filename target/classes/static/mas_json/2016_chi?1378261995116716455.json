{"title": "SnapApp: Reducing Authentication Overhead with a Time-Constrained Fast Unlock Option.", "fields": ["snap", "data logger", "experience sampling method", "expiration", "limiting"], "abstract": "We present  SnapApp , a novel unlock concept for mobile devices that reduces authentication overhead with a time-constrained quick-access option.  SnapApp  provides two unlock methods at once: While PIN entry enables full access to the device, users can also bypass authentication with a short sliding gesture ( \"Snap\" ). This grants access for a limited amount of time (e.g. 30 seconds). The device then automatically locks itself upon expiration. Our concept further explores limiting the possible number of  Snaps  in a row, and configuring blacklists for app use during short access (e.g. to exclude banking apps). We discuss opportunities and challenges of this concept based on a 30-day field study with 18 participants, including data logging and experience sampling methods.  Snaps  significantly reduced unlock times, and our app was perceived to offer a good tradeoff. Conceptual challenges include, for example, supporting users in configuring their blacklists.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Buschek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buschek:Daniel", "Fabian Hartmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartmann:Fabian", "Emanuel von Zezschwitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zezschwitz:Emanuel_von", "Alexander De Luca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luca:Alexander_De", "Florian Alt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alt:Florian"], "pages": 12}
