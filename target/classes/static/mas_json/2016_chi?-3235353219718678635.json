First, our own autobiographical design enquiry, using Feldenkrais as a resource in our design process, bringing out the  Soma Carpet  and  Breathing Light  applications. Second, through bringing in others to experience our systems, engaging with and qualitatively analysing their experiences of our applications. In our third enquiry, we try to pin down what characterises and sets Somaesthetic Appreciation designs apart through comparing with and analysing others' design inquiries as well as grounding them in the somaesthetic theories. We propose that the Somaesthetic Appreciation designs share a  subtleness  in how they encourage and spur bodily inquiry in their choice of interaction modalities, they require an  intimate correspondence  -- feedback and interactions that follow the rhythm of the body, they entail a distinct manner of  making space  shutting out the outside world -- metaphorically and literally -- to allow users to turn their attention inwards, and they rely on  articulation  of bodily experiences to encourage learning and increased somatic awareness.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology", "Mobile Life@SIC ... , Kista, Sweden", "SICS, Kista, Sweden"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kristina H\u00f6\u00f6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml==ouml=k:Kristina", "Martin P.
