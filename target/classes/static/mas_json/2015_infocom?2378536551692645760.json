While efforts have been dedicated to improve the accuracy and efficiency of localization, the fundamental limits of RSS fingerprinting based methodology itself is still unknown in a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we present a general probabilistic model to shed light on a fundamental question: how good the RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization can achieve? Concretely, we present the probability that a user can be localized in a region with certain size, given the RSS fingerprints submitted to the system. We reveal the interaction among the localization accuracy, the reliability of location estimation and the number of measurements in the RSS fingerprinting based location determination. Moreover, we present the optimal fingerprints reporting strategy that can achieve the best accuracy for given reliability and the number of measurements, which provides a design guideline for the RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization facilitated by crowdsourcing paradigm.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Yutian Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Yutian", "Xiaohua Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Xiaohua", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing", "Songwu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Songwu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
