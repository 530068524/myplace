{"title": "Culturally based design: embodying trans-surface interaction in rummy.", "fields": ["turn taking", "human computer interaction", "affordance", "sensemaking", "embodied cognition"], "abstract": "We present culturally based design (CBD), a new paradigm for designing embodied natural user interaction (NUI) with digital information by drawing on customary ways that people use physical objects. CBD coalesces experiences, practices, and embodied mental models of pre-digital activities as a basis for the design of interactive systems. We apply CBD to address  trans-surface interaction , the manipulation of information artifacts from one device to another. We develop Trans-Surface Rummy, because the game involves highly dynamic combinations of turn taking and non-linear out of turn play, while transferring information artifacts to and from private and social surfaces. Through the CBD process, we create the  trans-surface wormhole , an embodied interface technique. We investigate the trans-surface wormhole's efficacy and other aspects of culturally based design with young students, and with elderly members of our local bridge club. We derive implications for the design of trans-surface interaction, and more broadly, from the process of CBD. We initiate a research agenda for trans-surface interaction.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Andruid Kerne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kerne:Andruid", "William A.
