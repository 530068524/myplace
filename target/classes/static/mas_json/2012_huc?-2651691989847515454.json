However, building a practical home activity monitoring system remains a challenge. Striking a balance between cost, privacy, ease of installation and scalability continues to be an elusive goal. In this paper, we explore infrastructure-mediated sensing combined with a vector space model learning approach as the basis of an activity recognition system for the home. We examine the performance of our single-sensor water-based system in recognizing eleven high-level activities in the kitchen and bathroom, such as cooking and shaving. Results from two studies show that our system can estimate activities with overall accuracy of 82.69% for one individual and 70.11% for a group of 23 participants. As far as we know, our work is the first to employ infrastructure-mediated sensing for inferring high-level human activities in a home setting.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Edison Thomaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomaz:Edison", "Vinay Bettadapura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bettadapura:Vinay", "Gabriel Reyes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reyes:Gabriel", "Megha Sandesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sandesh:Megha", "Grant Schindler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schindler:Grant", "Thomas Pl\u00f6tz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pl=ouml=tz:Thomas", "Gregory D.
