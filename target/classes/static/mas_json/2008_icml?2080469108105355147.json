{"title": "Robust matching and recognition using context-dependent kernels.", "fields": ["3d single object recognition", "variable kernel density estimation", "fidelity", "regularization", "kernel method"], "abstract": "The success of kernel methods including support vector machines (SVMs) strongly depends on the design of appropriate kernels. While initially kernels were designed in order to handle fixed-length data, their extension to unordered, variable-length data became more than necessary for real pattern recognition problems such as object recognition and bioinformatics.   We focus in this paper on object recognition using a new type of kernel referred to as \"context-dependent\". Objects, seen as constellations of local features (interest points, regions, etc.), are matched by minimizing an energy function mixing (1) a fidelity term which measures the quality of feature matching, (2) a neighborhood criterion which captures the object geometry and (3) a regularization term. We will show that the fixed-point of this energy is a \"context-dependent\" kernel (\"CDK\") which also satisfies the Mercer condition. Experiments conducted on object recognition show that when plugging our kernel in SVMs, we clearly outperform SVMs with \"context-free\" kernels.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Hichem Sahbi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahbi:Hichem", "Jean-Yves Audibert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Audibert:Jean=Yves", "Jaonary Rabarisoa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabarisoa:Jaonary", "Renaud Keriven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keriven:Renaud"], "pages": 8}
