This paper introduces a framework, in which objects, enriched with information about their sound properties, are being processed to generate virtual sound sources. This is done with an automatic processing of the 3D-scene and therefore minimizes the effort needed to develop a multimodal virtual world. In order to create a comprehensive auditory experience different types of sound sources have to be distinguished. We propose a differentiation into three classes: locally bound static sounds, dynamically created event based sounds, and ambient sounds to create spatial atmosphere.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Bielefeld University", "Bielefeld University"], "authors": ["Julia Fr\u00f6hlich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fr=ouml=hlich:Julia", "Ipke Wachsmuth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wachsmuth:Ipke"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
