An abstraction defines an admissible heuristic function as the distances in a smaller state space where arbitrary sets of states are \"aggregated\" into single states. A special case are pattern database (PDB) heuristics, which aggregate states if they agree on the state variables inside the pattern. Explicit-state abstraction is more flexible, explicitly aggregating selected pairs of states in a process that interleaves composition of abstractions with abstraction of the composites. The increased flexibility gains expressive power: sometimes, the real cost function can be represented concisely as an explicit-state abstraction, but not as a PDB. Explicit-state abstraction has been applied to planning and model checking, with highly promiSing empirical results.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "Australian National University", "University of Innsbruck"], "authors": ["Malte Helmert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helmert:Malte", "Patrik Haslum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haslum:Patrik", "J\u00f6rg Hoffmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoffmann_0001:J=ouml=rg"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
