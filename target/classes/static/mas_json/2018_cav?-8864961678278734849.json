Designing approximate circuits is a very complex and time-demanding process trying to find optimal trade-offs between the approximation error and resource savings. In this paper, we present ADAC\u2014a novel framework for automated design of approximate arithmetic circuits. ADAC integrates in a unique way efficient simulation and formal methods for approximate equivalence checking into a search-based circuit optimisation. To make ADAC easily accessible, it is implemented as a module of the ABC tool: a state-of-the-art system for circuit synthesis and verification. Within several hours, ADAC is able to construct high-quality Pareto sets of complex circuits (including even 32-bit multipliers), providing useful trade-offs between the resource consumption and the error that is formally guaranteed. This demonstrates outstanding performance and scalability compared with other existing approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Brno University of Technology", "Brno University of Technology", "Brno University of Technology", "Brno University of Technology", "Brno University of Technology"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Milan Ceska Jr......http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceska_Jr=:Milan", "Jir\u00ed Maty\u00e1s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maty=aacute=s:Jir=iacute=", "Vojtech Mrazek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mrazek:Vojtech", "Luk\u00e1s Sekanina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sekanina:Luk=aacute=s", "Zdenek Vas\u00edcek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vas=iacute=cek:Zdenek", "Tom\u00e1s Vojnar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vojnar:Tom=aacute=s"], "pages": 9}
