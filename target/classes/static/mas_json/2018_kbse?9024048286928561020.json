Often requests in these systems involve ten to thousands Remote Procedure Calls, each of which can be a source of performance degradation. The PhD programme presented here intends to address this issue by providing automated instruments to effectively drive performance fault injection in distributed systems. The envisioned approach exploits multi-objective search-based techniques to automatically find small combinations of tiny performance degradations induced by specific RPCs,which have significant impacts on the user-perceived performance. Automating the search of these events will improve the ability to inject performance issues in production in order to force developers to anticipate and mitigate them.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of L'Aquila"], "authors": ["Luca Traini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traini:Luca"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
