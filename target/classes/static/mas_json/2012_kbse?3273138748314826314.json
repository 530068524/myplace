In this paper, we present Boreas, an accurate and scalable token-based approach for code clone detection. Boreas introduces a novel counting-based method to define the characteristic matrices, which are able to describe the program segments distinctly and effectively for the purpose of clone detection. We conducted experiments on JDK 7 and Linux kernel 2.6.38.6 source code. Experimental results show that Boreas is able to match the detecting accuracy of a recently proposed syntactic-based tool Deckard, with the execution time reduced by more than an order of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Yang Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Yang", "Yao Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo_0001:Yao"], "pages": 4}
