In this paper, a new spatio-temporal hierarchical agglomerative clustering (STHAC) method is proposed for automatic extraction of face exemplars for face recognition in video sequences. Two variants of STHAC are presented \u2014 a global variety that unifies spatial and temporal distances between points, and a local variety that introduces perturbation of distances based on a local spatio-temporal neighborhood criterion. Faces that are nearest to the cluster means are chosen as exemplars for the testing stage, where subjects in the test video sequences are recognized using a probabilistic-based classifier. Extensive evaluation on a face video database demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method, and the significance of incorporating temporal information for exemplar extraction.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Multimedia University", "Multimedia University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["John See.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/See:John", "Chikkannan Eswaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eswaran:Chikkannan"], "pages": 6}
