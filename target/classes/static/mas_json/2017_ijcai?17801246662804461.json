Analogous to machine translation, we present a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks (RNN) model for image caption generation. Different from most existing work where the whole image is represented by convolutional neural network (CNN) feature, we propose to represent the input image as a sequence of detected objects which feeds as the source sequence of the RNN model. In this way, the sequential representation of an image can be naturally translated to a sequence of words, as the target sequence of the RNN model. To represent the image in a sequential way, we extract the objects features in the image and arrange them in a order using convolutional neural networks. To further leverage the visual information from the encoded objects, a sequential attention layer is introduced to selectively attend to the objects that are related to generate corresponding words in the sentences. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach on popular benchmark dataset, i.e., MS COCO, and the proposed model surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in all metrics following the dataset splits of previous work. The proposed approach is also evaluated by the evaluation server of MS COCO captioning challenge, and achieves very competitive results, e.g., a CIDEr of 1.029 (c5) and 1.064 (c40).", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Chang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chang", "Fuchun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Fuchun", "Changhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Changhu", "Feng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0015:Feng", "Alan L.
