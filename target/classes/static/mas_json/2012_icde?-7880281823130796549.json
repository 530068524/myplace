{"title": "Cross Domain Search by Exploiting Wikipedia.", "fields": ["user experience design", "exploit", "electronic publishing", "semantics", "modalities"], "abstract": "The abundance of Web 2.0 resources in various media formats calls for better resource integration to enrich user experience. This naturally leads to a new cross-modal resource search requirement, in which a query is a resource in one modal and the results are closely related resources in other modalities. With cross-modal search, we can better exploit existing resources. Tags associated with Web 2.0 resources are intuitive medium to link resources with different modality together. However, tagging is by nature an ad hoc activity. They often contain noises and are affected by the subjective inclination of the tagger. Consequently, linking resources simply by tags will not be reliable. In this paper, we propose an approach for linking tagged resources to concepts extracted from Wikipedia, which has become a fairly reliable reference over the last few years. Compared to the tags, the concepts are therefore of higher quality. We develop effective methods for cross-modal search based on the concepts associated with resources. Extensive experiments were conducted, and the results show that our solution achieves good performance.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Chen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chen", "Sai Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Sai", "Shouxu Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Shouxu", "Anthony K.
