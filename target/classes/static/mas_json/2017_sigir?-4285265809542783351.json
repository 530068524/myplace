We argue that such classification tasks are correlated and we propose a multitask approach based on a recurrent neural network that benefits by jointly learning them. Our study demonstrates the potential of multitask models on this type of problems and improves the state-of-the-art results in the fine-grained sentiment classification problem.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Georgios Balikas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balikas:Georgios", "Simon Moura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moura:Simon", "Massih-Reza Amini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amini:Massih=Reza"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
