However, irreversible degradation mechanisms jeopardize battery lifetime, calling for intelligent management policies, which minimize the impact of these phenomena while guaranteeing a minimum Quality of Service (QoS). This paper explores a mathematical characterization of harvesting-based battery-powered sensor devices, focusing on the impact of the battery discharge policy on the irreversible degradation of the storage capacity. A general framework based on Markov chains which captures the battery degradation process is proposed. Based on such model, it is shown that a degradationaware policy significantly improves the lifetime of the sensor compared to \"greedy\" operation policies, while guaranteeing the minimum required QoS.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Padua", "University of Padua", "University of Padua", "University of Padua", "University of Padua"], "authors": ["Nicol\u00f2 Michelusi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michelusi:Nicol=ograve=", "Leonardo Badia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badia:Leonardo", "Ruggero Carli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carli:Ruggero", "Luca Corradini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Corradini:Luca", "Michele Zorzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zorzi:Michele"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
