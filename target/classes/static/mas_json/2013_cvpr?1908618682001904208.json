{"title": "Finding Things: Image Parsing with Regions and Per-Exemplar Detectors.", "fields": ["segmentation based object categorization", "scale space segmentation", "range segmentation", "feature detection", "standard test image"], "abstract": "This paper presents a system for image parsing, or labeling each pixel in an image with its semantic category, aimed at achieving broad coverage across hundreds of object categories, many of them sparsely sampled. The system combines region-level features with per-exemplar sliding window detectors. Per-exemplar detectors are better suited for our parsing task than traditional bounding box detectors: they perform well on classes with little training data and high intra-class variation, and they allow object masks to be transferred into the test image for pixel-level segmentation. The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three challenging datasets, the largest of which contains 45,676 images and 232 labels.", "citation": "Citations (195)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Joseph Tighe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tighe:Joseph", "Svetlana Lazebnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazebnik:Svetlana"], "pages": 8}
