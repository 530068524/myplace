Given a large, community-authored, question-paraphrase corpus, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn a semantic lexicon and linear ranking function without manually annotating questions. Our approach automatically generalizes a seed lexicon and includes a scalable, parallelized perceptron parameter estimation scheme. Experiments show that our approach more than quadruples the recall of the seed lexicon, with only an 8% loss in precision.", "citation": "Citations (190)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Anthony Fader.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fader:Anthony", "Luke S.
