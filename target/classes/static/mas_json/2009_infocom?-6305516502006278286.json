Every data block to be multicast is translated into a sequence of  K + n  packets, from which every receiver must receive at least  K  in order to correctly decode the block. The new problem is to determine which PHY-layer modulation and coding scheme (MCS) the base station should use for each packet. We present several variants of this problem, which differ in the number of automatic repeat request (ARQ) rounds during which the delivery of a data block must be completed. Most of these variants are shown to be NP-hard. However, we present optimal solutions for practical instances, where the number of MCSs is small, and efficient approximations and heuristics for the general case of each variant.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Reuven Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Reuven", "Guy Grebla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grebla:Guy", "Liran Katzir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katzir_0001:Liran"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
