In particular, we establish both theoretically and computationally that our proposal can serve as a viable alternative to state-of-the-art parametric ADP algorithms, freeing the designer from carefully specifying an approximation architecture. We accomplish this by developing a kernel-based mathematical program for ADP. Via a computational study on a controlled queueing network, we show that our procedure is competitive with parametric ADP approaches.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Nikhil Bhat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhat:Nikhil", "Ciamac C.
