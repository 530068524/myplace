{"title": "Spectrum-Based Multiple Fault Localization.", "fields": ["logical reasoning", "behavioral modeling", "formal proof", "probabilistic logic", "model based reasoning"], "abstract": "Fault diagnosis approaches can generally be categorized into spectrum-based fault localization (SFL, correlating failures with abstractions of program traces), and model-based diagnosis (MBD, logic reasoning over a behavioral model). Although MBD approaches are inherently more accurate than SFL, their high computational complexity prohibits application to large programs. We present a framework to combine the best of both worlds, coined BARINEL. The program is modeled using abstractions of program traces (as in SFL) while Bayesian reasoning is used to deduce multiple-fault candidates and their probabilities (as in MBD). A particular feature of BARINEL is the usage of a probabilistic component model that accounts for the fact that faulty components may fail intermittently. Experimental results on both synthetic and real software programs show that BARINEL typically outperforms current SFL approaches at a cost complexity that is only marginally higher. In the context of single faults this superiority is established by formal proof.", "citation": "Citations (226)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Rui Abreu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abreu:Rui", "Peter Zoeteweij.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zoeteweij:Peter", "Arjan J.
