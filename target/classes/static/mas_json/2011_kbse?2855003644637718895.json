{"title": "TestEra: A tool for testing Java programs using alloy specifications.", "fields": ["declarative programming", "real time java", "java modeling language", "correctness", "initialization"], "abstract": "This tool paper presents an embodiment of TestEra - a framework developed in previous work for specification-based testing of Java programs. To test a Java method, TestEra uses the method's pre-condition specification to generate test inputs and the post-condition to check correctness of outputs. TestEra supports specifications written in Alloy - a first-order, declarative language based on relations - and uses the SAT-based back-end of the Alloy tool-set for systematic generation of test suites. Each test case is a JUnit test method, which performs three key steps: (1) initialization of pre-state, i.e., creation of inputs to the method under test; (2) invocation of the method; and (3) checking the correctness of post-state, i.e., checking the method output. The tool supports visualization of inputs and outputs as object graphs for graphical illustration of method behavior. TestEra is available for download to be used as a library or as an Eclipse plug-in.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Shadi Abdul Khalek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khalek:Shadi_Abdul", "Guowei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Guowei", "Lingming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lingming", "Darko Marinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinov:Darko", "Sarfraz Khurshid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khurshid:Sarfraz"], "pages": 4}
