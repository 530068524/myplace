In this paper, we study the privacy concerns of the blood transfusion information-sharing system between the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service (BTS) and public hospitals, and identify the major challenges that make traditional data anonymization methods not applicable. Furthermore, we propose a new privacy model called LKC-privacy, together with an anonymization algorithm, to meet the privacy and information requirements in this BTS case. Experiments on the real-life data demonstrate that our anonymization algorithm can effectively retain the essential information in anonymous data for data analysis and is scalable for anonymizing large datasets.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "departments": ["Concordia University", "Concordia University", "University of Ontario Institute of Technology", "Hong Kong Red C ... ong Kong, China"], "authors": ["Noman Mohammed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohammed:Noman", "Benjamin C.
