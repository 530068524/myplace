{"title": "Designing action-based exergames for children with cerebral palsy.", "fields": ["video game design", "engineering design process", "cerebral palsy", "gross motor skill", "participatory design"], "abstract": "Children with cerebral palsy (CP) want to play fast-paced action-oriented videogames similar to those played by their peers without motor disabilities. This is particularly true of exergames, whose physically-active gameplay matches the fast pace of action games. But disabilities resulting from CP can make it difficult to play action games. Guidelines for developing games for people with motor disabilities steer away from high-paced action, including recommendations to avoid the need for time-sensitive actions and to keep game pace slow. Through a year-long participatory design process with children with CP, we have discovered that it is in fact possible to develop action-oriented exergames for children with CP at level III on the Gross Motor Function Classification Scale. We followed up the design process with an eight-week home trial, in which we found the games to be playable and enjoyable. In this paper, we discuss the design of these games, and present a set of design recommendations for how to achieve both action-orientation and playability.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["Queen's University", "Queen's University", "Queen's University", "Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital", "Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital"], "authors": ["Hamilton A.
