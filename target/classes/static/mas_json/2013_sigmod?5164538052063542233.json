{"title": "Lightweight authentication of linear algebraic queries on data streams.", "fields": ["verifiable secret sharing", "data stream mining", "correctness", "complex event processing", "joins"], "abstract": "We consider a  stream outsourcing  setting, where a data owner delegates the management of a set of disjoint data streams to an untrusted server. The owner  authenticates  his streams via signatures. The server processes continuous queries on the union of the streams for clients trusted by the owner. Along with the results, the server sends proofs of result correctness derived from the owner's signatures, which are easily verifiable by the clients. We design novel constructions for a collection of fundamental problems over streams represented as  linear algebraic  queries. In particular, our basic schemes authenticate  dynamic vector sums  and  dot products , as well as  dynamic matrix products . These techniques can be adapted for authenticating a wide range of important operations in streaming environments, including group by queries, joins, in-network aggregation, similarity matching, and event processing. All our schemes are very  lightweight , and offer strong  cryptographic  guarantees derived from formal definitions and proofs. We experimentally confirm the practicality of our schemes.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "AT&T Labs", "Technical University of Crete", "Technical University of Crete"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Stavros Papadopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadopoulos_0001:Stavros", "Graham Cormode.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cormode:Graham", "Antonios Deligiannakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deligiannakis:Antonios", "Minos N.
