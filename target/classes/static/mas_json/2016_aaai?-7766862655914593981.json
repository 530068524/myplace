In real-life scenarios such as surveillance videos, each image set often contains much redundancy in terms of features and samples. This paper introduces a joint learning method for image-set classification that simultaneously learns compact binary codes and removes redundant samples. The joint objective function of our model mainly includes two parts. The first part seeks a hashing function to generate binary codes that have larger inter-class and smaller intra-class distances. The second one reduces redundant samples with discrete constraints in a low-rank way. A kernel method based on anchor points is further used to reduce sample variations. The proposed discrete objective function is simplified to a series of sub-problems that admit an analytical solution, resulting in a high-quality discrete solution with a low computational cost. Experiments on three commonly used image-set datasets show that the proposed method for the tasks of face recognition from image sets is efficient and effective.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Center for Excellence in Education", "Center for Excellence in Education", "Center for Excellence in Education", "Center for Excellence in Education", "Center for Excellence in Education"], "authors": ["Man Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Man", "Ran He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Ran", "Dong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Dong", "Zhenan Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Zhenan", "Tieniu Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Tieniu"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
