In this paper, we study constrained versions of the relay node placement problem, where relay nodes can only be placed at a subset of candidate locations. In the connected relay node placement problem, we want to place a minimum number of relay nodes to ensure the connectivity of the sensor nodes and the base stations. In the survivable relay node placement problem, we want to place a minimum number of relay nodes to ensure the biconnectivity of the sensor nodes and the base stations. For each of the two problems, we discuss its computational complexity, and present a framework of polynomial time O(1) -approximation algorithms with small approximation ratios.", "citation": "Citations (160)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Montana State University"], "authors": ["Satyajayant Misra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Misra:Satyajayant", "Seung Don Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Seung_Don", "Guoliang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Guoliang", "Jian Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0008:Jian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 5}
