{"title": "Inference algorithms for pattern-based CRFs on sequence data.", "fields": ["substring", "alphabet", "crfs", "string", "combinatorics"], "abstract": "We consider Conditional random fields (CRFs) with pattern-based potentials defined on a chain. In this model the energy of a string (labeling) $$x_1\\ldots x_n$$x1\u017axn is the sum of terms over intervals [i, j] where each term is non-zero only if the substring $$x_i\\ldots x_j$$xi\u017axj equals a prespecified pattern w. Such CRFs can be naturally applied to many sequence tagging problems. We present efficient algorithms for the three standard inference tasks in a CRF, namely computing (i) the partition function, (ii) marginals, and (iii) computing the MAP. Their complexities are respectively $$O(\\textit{nL})$$O(nL), $$O(\\textit{nL} \\ell _{\\max })$$O(nLlmax) and $$O(\\textit{nL} \\min \\{|D|,\\log (\\ell _{\\max }\\!+\\!1)\\})$$O(nLmin{|D|,log(lmax+1)}) where L is the combined length of input patterns, $$\\ell _{\\max }$$lmax is the maximum length of a pattern, and D is the input alphabet. This improves on the previous algorithms of Ye et al. (NIPS, 2009) whose complexities are respectively $$O(\\textit{nL} |D|)$$O(nL|D|), $$O\\left( n |\\varGamma | L^2 \\ell _{\\max }^2\\right) $$On|\u0393|L2lmax2 and $$O(\\textit{nL} |D|)$$O(nL|D|), where $$|\\varGamma |$$|\u0393| is the number of input patterns. In addition, we give an efficient algorithm for sampling, and revisit the case of MAP with non-positive weights.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "authors": ["Rustem Takhanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takhanov:Rustem", "Vladimir Kolmogorov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolmogorov:Vladimir"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
