{"title": "Cross-Tenant Side-Channel Attacks in PaaS Clouds.", "fields": ["cloud computing security", "tracing", "cache", "leverage", "side channel attack"], "abstract": "We present a new attack framework for conducting cache-based side-channel attacks and demonstrate this framework in attacks between tenants on commercial Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds. Our framework uses the FLUSH-RELOAD attack of Gullasch et al. as a primitive, and extends this work by leveraging it within an automaton-driven strategy for tracing a victim's execution. We leverage our framework first to confirm co-location of tenants and then to extract secrets across tenant boundaries. We specifically demonstrate attacks to collect potentially sensitive application data (e.g., the number of items in a shopping cart), to hijack user accounts, and to break SAML single sign-on. To the best of our knowledge, our attacks are the first granular, cross-tenant, side-channel attacks successfully demonstrated on state-of-the-art commercial clouds, PaaS or otherwise.", "citation": "Citations (179)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Cornell University", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Yinqian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yinqian", "Ari Juels.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juels:Ari", "Michael K.
