{"title": "HICO: A Benchmark for Recognizing Human-Object Interactions in Images.", "fields": ["semantic memory", "pattern recognition", "computer vision", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We introduce a new benchmark \"Humans Interacting with Common Objects\" (HICO) for recognizing human-object interactions (HOI). We demonstrate the key features of HICO: a diverse set of interactions with common object categories, a list of well-defined, sense-based HOI categories, and an exhaustive labeling of co-occurring interactions with an object category in each image. We perform an in-depth analysis of representative current approaches and show that DNNs enjoy a significant edge. In addition, we show that semantic knowledge can significantly improve HOI recognition, especially for uncommon categories.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Electrical Engi ... and Engineering"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yu-Wei Chao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chao:Yu=Wei", "Zhan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhan", "Yugeng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yugeng", "Jiaxuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jiaxuan", "Jia Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Jia"], "pages": 9}
