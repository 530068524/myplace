Existing mobile platforms provide little information on how applications use private user data, making it difficult for experts to validate applications and for users to grant applications access to their private data. We propose a user-aware privacy control approach, which reveals how private information is used inside applications. We compute static information flows and classify them as safe/unsafe based on a tamper analysis that tracks whether private data is obscured before escaping through output channels. This flow information enables platforms to provide default settings that expose private data only for safe flows, thereby preserving privacy and minimizing decisions required from users. We built our approach into TouchDevelop, an application-creation environment that allows users to write scripts on mobile devices and install scripts published by other users. We evaluate our approach by studying 546 scripts published by 194 users.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Xusheng Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Xusheng", "Nikolai Tillmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tillmann:Nikolai", "Manuel F\u00e4hndrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/F=auml=hndrich:Manuel", "Jonathan de Halleux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halleux:Jonathan_de", "Michal Moskal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moskal:Michal"], "pages": 10}
