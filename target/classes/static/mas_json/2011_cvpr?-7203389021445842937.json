First we show that this representation can be used to estimate the pose of people defined by the 3D orientations of the head and torso in the challenging PASCAL VOC 2010 person detection dataset. Our method is robust to clutter, aspect and viewpoint variation and works even when body parts like faces and limbs are occluded or hard to localize. We combine this representation with other sources of information like interaction with objects and other people in the image and use it for action recognition. We report competitive results on the PASCAL VOC 2010 static image action classification challenge.", "citation": "Citations (273)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Subhransu Maji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maji:Subhransu", "Lubomir D.
