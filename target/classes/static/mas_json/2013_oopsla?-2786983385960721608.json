{"title": "Data-driven equivalence checking.", "fields": ["data driven", "markov chain monte carlo", "formal equivalence checking", "x86", "superoptimization"], "abstract": "We present a data driven algorithm for equivalence checking of two loops. The algorithm infers simulation relations using data from test runs. Once a candidate simulation relation has been obtained, off-the-shelf SMT solvers are used to check whether the simulation relation actually holds. The algorithm is sound: insufficient data will cause the proof to fail. We demonstrate a prototype implementation, called DDEC, of our algorithm, which is the first sound equivalence checker for loops written in x86 assembly.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Rahul Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma_0001:Rahul", "Eric Schkufza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schkufza:Eric", "Berkeley R.
