This task can be based, for instance, on locality-based modules. However, a single module does not allow us to understand neither topicality, connectedness, structure, or superfluous parts of an ontology, nor agreement between actual and intended modeling.\n\nThe strong logical properties of locality-based modules suggest that the family of all such modules of an ontology can support comprehension of the ontology as a whole. However, extracting that family is not feasible, since the number of locality-based modules of an ontology can be exponential w.r.t. its size.\n\nIn this paper we report on a new approach that enables us to efficiently extract a polynomial representation of the family of all locality-based modules of an ontology. We also describe the fundamental algorithm to pursue this task, and report on experiments carried out and results obtained.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "University of Bremen"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Chiara Del Vescovo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vescovo:Chiara_Del", "Bijan Parsia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parsia:Bijan", "Ulrike Sattler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sattler:Ulrike", "Thomas Schneider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schneider_0002:Thomas"], "pages": 6}
