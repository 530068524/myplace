{"title": "TopCells: Keyword-based search of top-k aggregated documents in text cube.", "fields": ["learning to rank", "keyword density", "cube", "data cube", "tuple"], "abstract": "Previous studies on supporting keyword queries in RDBMSs provide users with a ranked list of relevant linked structures (e.g. joined tuples) or individual tuples. In this paper, we aim to support keyword search in a data cube with text-rich dimension(s) (so-called text cube). Each document is associated with structural dimensions. A cell in the text cube aggregates a set of documents with matching dimension values on a subset of dimensions. Given a keyword query, our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells in the text cube. We propose a relevance scoring model and efficient ranking algorithms. Experiments are conducted to verify their efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Bolin Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Bolin", "Bo Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Bo", "Cindy Xide Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Cindy_Xide", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei", "Chengxiang Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Chengxiang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
