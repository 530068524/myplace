Many students learn the content of different subjects outside the classroom by watching videos on YouTube, Vimeo, Khan Academy, and other sources. Nevertheless, exams are currently the best feedback indication of how effective the student's study session was. Physiological sensors such as electroencephalography (EEG) are accurate enough for measuring attention levels for feedback during self-learning. The traditional representation of brain data is complex for everyday users to comprehend; therefore, such graphs need to be represented in the form of static visualizations for simplicity. In this paper, we describe visualizations formulated by college students in focus groups sessions to visualize attention data for feedback after completing a learning task. These visualizations help us understand user's preference and perception for representing attention, which can be implemented in future quantified-self applications and dashboards.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Marvin Andujar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andujar:Marvin", "Juan E.
