We focus here on user's retweeting behavior which has been considered as a key mechanism of information diffusion in social networks. Since we can only observe on which messages user retweet. It is a typically one-class setting which only positive examples or implicit feedback can be observed. However, few research works on retweeting prediction consider one-class setting. In this paper, we analyze and study the fundamental factors that might affect retweetability of a tweet, and then employ one-class collaborative filtering method by quantitatively measure the user personal preference and social influence between users and messages to predict user's retweeting behavior. Experimental results on a real-world dataset from social network show that the proposed method is effective and can improve the performance of the one-class collaborative filtering over baseline methods through leveraging weighted negative examples information.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "National Comput ...
