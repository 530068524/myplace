Typically, these systems operate on domain-specific fractions of public medical data. MOLIERE, in contrast, utilizes information from over 24.5 million documents and does not limit the document vocabulary. At the heart of our approach lies a multi-modal and multi-relational network of biomedical objects extracted from several heterogeneous datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). These objects include but are not limited to scientific papers, keywords, genes, proteins, diseases, and diagnoses. We model hypotheses using Latent Dirichlet Allocation applied on abstracts found near shortest paths discovered within this network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MOLIERE by performing hypothesis generation on historical data. Our network, implementation, and resulting data are all publicly available for the broad scientific community.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Clemson University", "University of South Carolina", "Clemson University"], "authors": ["Justin Sybrandt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sybrandt:Justin", "Michael Shtutman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shtutman:Michael", "Ilya Safro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Safro:Ilya"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
