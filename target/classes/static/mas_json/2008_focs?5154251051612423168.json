{"title": "Eigenvalue Bounds, Spectral Partitioning, and Metrical Deformations via Flows.", "fields": ["planar graph", "degree", "indifference graph", "rayleigh quotient", "spectral graph theory", "pathwidth"], "abstract": "We present a new method for upper bounding the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian of graphs. Our approach uses multi-commodity flows to deform the geometry of the graph; we embed the resulting metric into Euclidean space to recover a bound on the Rayleigh quotient. Using this, we show that every  n -vertex graph of genus  g  and maximum degree  D  satisfies \u03bb 2 ( G )e O (( g +1) 3  D / n ). This recovers the  O ( D / n ) bound of Spielman and Teng for planar graphs, and compares to Kelner's bound of  O (( g +1)poly( D )/ n ), but our proof does not make use of conformal mappings or circle packings. We are thus able to extend this to resolve positively a conjecture of Spielman and Teng, by proving that \u03bb 2 ( G ) e  O ( D  h  6 log  h / n ) whenever  G  is  K   h  -minor free. This shows, in particular, that spectral partitioning can be used to recover  O (s n )-sized separators in bounded degree graphs that exclude a fixed minor. We extend this further by obtaining nearly optimal bounds on \u03bb 2  for graphs that exclude small-depth minors in the sense of Plotkin, Rao, and Smith. Consequently, we show that spectral algorithms find separators of sublinear size in a general class of geometric graphs.   Moreover, while the standard \u201csweep\u201d algorithm applied to the second eigenvector may fail to find good quotient cuts in graphs of unbounded degree, our approach produces a vector that works for  arbitrary  graphs. This yields an alternate proof of the well-known nonplanar separator theorem of Alon, Seymour, and Thomas that states that every excluded-minor family of graphs has  O (s n )-node balanced separators.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Punyashloka Biswal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biswal:Punyashloka", "James R.
