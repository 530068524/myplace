{"title": "A Spectral Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation.", "fields": ["hierarchical dirichlet process", "dirichlet multinomial distribution", "pachinko allocation", "topic model", "dynamic topic model"], "abstract": "Topic modeling is a generalization of clustering that posits that observations (words in a document) are generated by multiple latent factors (topics), as opposed to just one. The increased representational power comes at the cost of a more challenging unsupervised learning problem for estimating the topic-word distributions when only words are observed, and the topics are hidden. This work provides a simple and efficient learning procedure that is guaranteed to recover the parameters for a wide class of multi-view models and topic models, including latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). For LDA, the procedure correctly recovers both the topic-word distributions and the parameters of the Dirichlet prior over the topic mixtures, using only trigram statistics (i.e., third order moments, which may be estimated with documents containing just three words). The method is based on an efficiently computable orthogonal tensor decomposition of low-order moments.", "citation": "Citations (218)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "National Institute of Standards and Technology", "Columbia University", "Yahoo!", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Anima Anandkumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anandkumar:Anima", "Dean P.
