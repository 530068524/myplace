We simulate realistic 0-10 Hz earthquake ground motions relevant to building engineering design using high-performance AWP. Moreover, we show that AWP provides a speedup by a factor of 110 in key strain tensor calculations critical to probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). These performance improvements to critical scientific application software, coupled with improved co-scheduling capabilities of our workflow-managed systems, make a statewide hazard model a goal reachable with existing supercomputers. The performance improvements of GPU-based AWP are expected to save millions of core-hours over the next few years as physics-based seismic hazard analysis is developed using heterogeneous petascale supercomputers.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "San Diego State University", "University of California, San Diego", "San Diego State University"], "authors": ["Yifeng Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Yifeng", "Efecan Poyraz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poyraz:Efecan", "Kim B.
