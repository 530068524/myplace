In this approach, we consider a potentially infinite number of features and categorical outcomes. We evaluated these models for the task of within- and cross-document event coreference on two corpora. All the models we investigated show significant improvements when compared against an existing baseline for this task.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "Language Computer Corporation", "Language Computer Corporation", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Cosmin Adrian Bejan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bejan:Cosmin_Adrian", "Matthew Titsworth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Titsworth:Matthew", "Andrew Hickl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hickl:Andrew", "Sanda M.
