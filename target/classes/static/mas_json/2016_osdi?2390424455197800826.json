{"title": "Morpheus: Towards Automated SLOs for Enterprise Clusters.", "fields": ["operator", "analytics", "user expectations", "service level objective", "cluster"], "abstract": "Modern resource management frameworks for large-scale analytics leave unresolved the problematic tension between high cluster utilization and job's performance predictability--respectively coveted by operators and users. We address this in Morpheus, a new system that: 1) codifies implicit user expectations as explicit Service Level Objectives (SLOs), inferred from historical data, 2) enforces SLOs using novel scheduling techniques that isolate jobs from sharing-induced performance variability, and 3) mitigates inherent performance variance (e.g., due to failures) by means of dynamic reprovisioning of jobs. We validate these ideas against production traces from a 50k node cluster, and show that Morpheus can lower the number of deadline violations by 5\u00d7 to 13\u00d7, while retaining cluster-utilization, and lowering cluster footprint by 14% to 28%. We demonstrate the scalability and practicality of our implementation by deploying Morpheus on a 2700-node cluster and running it against production-derived workloads.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "osdi", "authors": ["Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jyothi:Sangeetha_Abdu", "Carlo Curino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curino:Carlo", "Ishai Menache.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menache:Ishai", "Shravan Matthur Narayanamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanamurthy:Shravan_Matthur", "Alexey Tumanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tumanov:Alexey", "Jonathan Yaniv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yaniv:Jonathan", "Ruslan Mavlyutov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mavlyutov:Ruslan", "I\u00f1igo Goiri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goiri:I=ntilde=igo", "Subru Krishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnan:Subru", "Janardhan Kulkarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulkarni:Janardhan", "Sriram Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Sriram"], "pages": 18}
