An important challenge of agent-based manufacturing control systems is to develop formal and structured approaches to support their specification and verification. This paper proposes a logic-based approach, by generalising that of model checking multiagent systems, for the reconfigurability of reactive multiagent systems. Two reconfigurability scenarios are studied, for the resulting system being a monolithic system or an individual module, and their computational complexity results are given.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Jinan University", "Macquarie University", "Griffith University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xiaowei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xiaowei", "Qingliang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qingliang", "Jie Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Jie", "Kaile Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Kaile"], "pages": 7}
