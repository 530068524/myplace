The key difficulty is that the number of alternatives is exponential in the number of issues, and hence it is infeasible for the agents to rank all the alternatives. A simple approach is to vote on the issues one at a time, in sequence; however, a drawback is that the outcome may depend on the order in which the issues are voted upon and decided, which gives the chairperson some control over the outcome of the election because she can strategically determine the order. While this is undeniably a negative feature of sequential voting, in this paper we temper this judgment by showing that the chairperson's control problem is, in most cases, computationally hard.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Duke University", "Paris Dauphine University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Vincent Conitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conitzer:Vincent", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Lirong Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Lirong"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
