More precisely, we prove that if one can efficiently predict the LSB with non-negligible advantage on a polynomial fraction of all the curves defined over a given finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, then with polynomial factor overhead, one can compute the entire Diffie---Hellman secret on a polynomial fraction of all the curves over the same finite field. Our approach is based on random self-reducibility (assuming GRH) of the Diffie---Hellman problem among elliptic curves of the same order. As a part of the argument, we prove a refinement of H. W. Lenstra's lower bounds on the sizes of the isogeny classes of elliptic curves, which may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Dimitar Jetchev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jetchev:Dimitar", "Ramarathnam Venkatesan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkatesan:Ramarathnam"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 18}
