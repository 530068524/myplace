The idea is that a congruence format for a semantics must ensure that formulas in the modal characterisation of this semantics are always decomposed into formulas in this modal characterisation. Here the decomposition method is enhanced to deal with modal characterisations that contain a modality \u2329e\u232a\u2329a\u232ap, to derive congruence formats for delay and weak bisimilarity.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["VU University Amsterdam", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Wan Fokkink.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fokkink:Wan", "Rob J. van Glabbeek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glabbeek:Rob_J=_van"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
