Our method can detect and segment identical objects directly from a single image or a handful of images without any supervision. To detect and segment all the object-level correspondences from the given images, a novel multi-layer match-growing method is proposed that starts from initial local feature matches and explores the images by intra-layer expansion and inter-layer merge. It estimates geometric relations between object entities and establishes \u2018object correspondence networks\u2019 that connect matching objects. Experiments demonstrate robust performance of our method on challenging datasets.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Minsu Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Minsu", "Young Min Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Young_Min", "Kyoung Mu Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kyoung_Mu"], "pages": 8}
