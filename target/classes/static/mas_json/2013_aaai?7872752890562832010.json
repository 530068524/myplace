{"title": "Cost-Optimal Planning by Self-Interested Agents.", "fields": ["management science", "nash equilibrium", "autonomous agent", "multi agent system", "mechanism design"], "abstract": "As our world becomes better connected and autonomous agents no longer appear to be science fiction, a natural need arises for enabling groups of selfish agents to cooperate in generating plans for diverse tasks that none of them can perform alone in a cost-effective manner. While most work on planning for/by selfish agents revolves around finding stable solutions (e.g., Nash Equilibrium), this work combines techniques from mechanism design with a recently introduced method for distributed planning, in order to find cost optimal (and, thus, social welfare maximizing) solutions. Based on the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms, we present both a centralized, and a privacy-preserving distributed mechanism.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Raz Nissim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nissim:Raz", "Ronen I.
