{"title": "EA-Analyzer: Automating Conflict Detection in Aspect-Oriented Requirements.", "fields": ["aspect oriented software development", "composability", "requirements analysis", "aspect oriented programming", "requirements management"], "abstract": "One of the aims of Aspect-Oriented Requirements Engineering is to address the composability and subsequent analysis of crosscutting and non-crosscutting concerns during requirements engineering. Composing concerns may help to reveal conflicting dependencies that need to be identified and resolved. However, detecting conflicts in a large set of textual aspect-oriented requirements is an error-prone and time-consuming task. This paper presents EA-Analyzer, the first automated tool for identifying conflicts in aspect-oriented requirements specified in natural-language text. The tool is based on a novel application of a Bayesian learning method that has been effective at classifying text. We present an empirical evaluation of the tool with three industrial-strength requirements documents from different real-life domains. We show that the tool achieves up to 92.97% accuracy when one of the case study documents is used as a training set and the other two as a validation set.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["Alberto Sardinha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sardinha:Alberto", "Ruzanna Chitchyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chitchyan:Ruzanna", "Nathan Weston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weston:Nathan", "Phil Greenwood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenwood:Phil", "Awais Rashid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rashid:Awais"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
