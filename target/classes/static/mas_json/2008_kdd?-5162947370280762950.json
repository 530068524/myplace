Each transaction is an arbitrary set of items chosen from a large universe. Detailed transaction data provides an electronic image of one's life. This has two implications. One, transaction data are excellent candidates for data mining research. Two, use of transaction data would raise serious concerns over individual privacy. Therefore, before transaction data is released for data mining, it must be made anonymous so that data subjects cannot be re-identified. The challenge is that transaction data has no structure and can be extremely high dimensional. Traditional anonymization methods lose too much information on such data. To date, there has been no satisfactory privacy notion and solution proposed for anonymizing transaction data. This paper proposes one way to address this issue.", "citation": "Citations (201)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Yabo Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yabo", "Ke Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Ke", "Ada Wai-Chee Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Ada_Wai=Chee", "Philip S.
