Although relations among other cryptanalytic approaches have been investigated, the link between these two methods has been missing. The motivation in this paper is to fix this gap and establish links between impossible differential cryptanalysis and integral cryptanalysis.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "National University of Defense Technology", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Bing Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Bing", "Zhiqiang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhiqiang", "Vincent Rijmen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rijmen:Vincent", "Ruilin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ruilin", "Lei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Lei", "Qingju Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qingju", "Hoda AlKhzaimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/AlKhzaimi:Hoda", "Chao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0002:Chao"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 21}
