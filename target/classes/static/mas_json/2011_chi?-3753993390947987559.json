We extend this research by 1) investigating the problems that readers experience in their real world tasks, 2) inquiring about their requirements for an ideal reading technology, and 3) updating earlier studies of naturalistic reading behavior, which are several years old now. We present here the results of our investigation, which included a diary study, interviews, and participatory design workshops.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Craig S.
