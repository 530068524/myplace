We study the problem of discovering the minimal project join query that contains the given example tuples in its output. Efficient discovery of such queries is challenging. We propose novel algorithms to solve this problem. Our experiments on real-life datasets show that the proposed solution is significantly more efficient compared with na\\\"{i}ve adaptations of known techniques.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yanyan Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yanyan", "Kaushik Chakrabarti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakrabarti:Kaushik", "Surajit Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Surajit", "Bolin Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Bolin", "Lev Novik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novik:Lev"], "pages": 12}
