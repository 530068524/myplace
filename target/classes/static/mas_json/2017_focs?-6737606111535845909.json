The last player to receive a message must output an index i such that x_i\u2260 y_i. We prove that the randomized one-way communication complexity of this problem in the public coin model is exactly \\Theta(\\min\\{n,\\log(1/\u03b4)\\log^2(\\frac n{\\log(1/\u03b4)})\\}) for failure probability \u03b4. Our lower bound holds even if promised \\mathop{support}(y)\u2284 \\mathop{support}(x). As a corollary, we obtain optimal lower bounds for \u2113_p-sampling in strict turnstile streams for 0\\le p streams for 0 \u2264 p", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Harvard University", "Tsinghua University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Michael Kapralov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapralov:Michael", "Jelani Nelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nelson:Jelani", "Jakub Pachocki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pachocki:Jakub", "Zhengyu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhengyu", "David P.
