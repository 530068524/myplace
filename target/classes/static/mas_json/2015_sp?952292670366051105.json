{"title": "CHERI: A Hybrid Capability-System Architecture for Scalable Software Compartmentalization.", "fields": ["software architecture", "memory protection", "systems architecture", "reduced instruction set computing", "compiler"], "abstract": "CHERI extends a conventional RISC Instruction-Set Architecture, compiler, and operating system to support fine-grained, capability-based memory protection to mitigate memory-related vulnerabilities in C-language TCBs. We describe how CHERI capabilities can also underpin a hardware-software object-capability model for application compartmentalization that can mitigate broader classes of attack. Prototyped as an extension to the open-source 64-bit BERI RISC FPGA soft-core processor, Free BSD operating system, and LLVM compiler, we demonstrate multiple orders-of-magnitude improvement in scalability, simplified programmability, and resulting tangible security benefits as compared to compartmentalization based on pure Memory-Management Unit (MMU) designs. We evaluate incrementally deployable CHERI-based compartmentalization using several real-world UNIX libraries and applications.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "SRI International", "University of Cambridge", "Memorial University of Newfoundland"], "authors": ["Robert N.
