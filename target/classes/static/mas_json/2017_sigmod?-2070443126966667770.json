{"title": "Optimizing Iceberg Queries with Complex Joins.", "fields": ["exploit", "cache", "memoization", "joins", "tuple"], "abstract": "Iceberg queries, commonly used for decision support, find groups whose aggregate values are above or below a threshold. In practice, iceberg queries are often posed over complex joins that are expensive to evaluate. This paper proposes a framework for combining a number of techniques---a-priori, memoization, and pruning---to optimize iceberg queries with complex joins. A-priori pushes partial GROUP BY and HAVING condition before a join to reduce its input size. Memoization caches and reuses join computation results. Pruning uses cached results to infer that certain tuples cannot contribute to the final query result, and short-circuits join computation. We formally derive conditions for correctly applying these techniques. Our practical rewrite algorithm produces highly efficient SQL that can exploit combinations of optimization opportunities in ways previously not possible. We evaluate our PostgreSQL-based implementation experimentally and show that it outperforms both baseline PostgreSQL and a commercial database system.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Brett Walenz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walenz:Brett", "Sudeepa Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Sudeepa", "Jun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Jun"], "pages": 16}
