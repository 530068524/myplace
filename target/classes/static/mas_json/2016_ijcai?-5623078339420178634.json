{"title": "Distributed Autoepistemic Logic and its Application to Access Control.", "fields": ["operator", "intuition", "autoepistemic logic", "modal logic", "access control"], "abstract": "In this paper we define and study an extension of autoepistemic logic (AEL) called distributed autoepistemic logic (dAEL) with multiple agents that have full introspection in their own knowledge as well as in that of others. This mutual full introspection between agents is motivated by an application of dAEL in access control. We define 2- and 3-valued semantic operators for dAEL. Using these operators, approximation fixpoint theory, an abstract algebraic framework that unifies different knowledge representation formalisms, immediately yields us a family of semantics for dAEL, each based on different intuitions that are well-studied in the context of AEL. The application in access control also motivates an extension of dAEL with inductive definitions (dAEL(ID)). We explain a use-case from access control to demonstrate how dAEL(ID) can be fruitfully applied to this domain and discuss how well-suited the different semantics are for the application in access control.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of Luxembourg", "Aalto University", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Pieter Van Hertum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hertum:Pieter_Van", "Marcos Cramer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cramer:Marcos", "Bart Bogaerts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogaerts_0001:Bart", "Marc Denecker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denecker:Marc"], "pages": 7}
