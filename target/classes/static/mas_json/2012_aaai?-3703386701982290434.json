{"title": "SPARQL Query Containment Under SHI Axioms.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "equivalence", "rdf schema", "sparql", "axiom"], "abstract": "SPARQL query containment under schema axioms is the problem of determining whether, for any RDF graph satisfying a given set of schema axioms, the answers to a query are contained in the answers of another query. This problem has major applications for verification and optimization of queries. In order to solve it, we rely on the \u00b5-calculus. Firstly, we provide a mapping from RDF graphs into transition systems. Secondly, SPARQL queries and RDFS and SHI axioms are encoded into \u00b5-calculus formulas. This allows us to reduce query containment and equivalence to satisfiability in the \u00b5-calculus. Finally, we prove a double exponential upper bound for containment under SHI schema axioms.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Melisachew Wudage Chekol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chekol:Melisachew_Wudage", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Euzenat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Euzenat:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Pierre Genev\u00e8s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Genev=egrave=s:Pierre", "Nabil Laya\u00efda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laya=iuml=da:Nabil"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
