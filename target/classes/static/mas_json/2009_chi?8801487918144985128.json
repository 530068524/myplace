In contrast to technology oriented approaches coming from Context Awareness research, we argue for a wider focus that complements the technical question of providing precise indoor location with the development of more effective navigation practices based on technology available today. Starting from research on indoor navigation conducted with the Paris Fire Brigade, we present two design concepts aimed at supporting firefighters in creating and finding their own paths, together with some of the design strategies that informed the creation of these concepts.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society"], "authors": ["Leonardo Ramirez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramirez:Leonardo", "Sebastian Denef.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denef:Sebastian", "Tobias Dyrks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dyrks:Tobias"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
