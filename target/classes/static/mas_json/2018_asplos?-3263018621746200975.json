{"title": "DATS - Data Containers for Web Applications.", "fields": ["data deduplication", "usability", "web application", "trusted computing base", "overhead"], "abstract": "Data containers enable users to control access to their data while untrusted applications compute on it. However, they require replicating an application inside each container - compromising functionality, programmability, and performance. We propose DATS - a system to run web applications that retains application usability and efficiency through a mix of hardware capability enhanced containers and the introduction of two new primitives modeled after the popular model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. (1) DATS introduces a templating language to create views that compose data across data containers. (2) DATS uses authenticated storage and confinement to enable an untrusted storage service, such as memcached and deduplication, to operate on plain-text data across containers. These two primitives act as robust declassifiers that allow DATS to enforce non-interference across containers, taking large applications out of the trusted computing base (TCB). We showcase eight different web applications including Gitlab and a Slack-like chat, significantly improve the worst-case overheads due to application replication, and demonstrate usable performance for common-case usage.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Casen Hunger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hunger:Casen", "Llu\u00eds Vilanova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vilanova:Llu=iacute=s", "Charalampos Papamanthou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papamanthou:Charalampos", "Yoav Etsion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etsion:Yoav", "Mohit Tiwari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiwari:Mohit"], "pages": 15}
