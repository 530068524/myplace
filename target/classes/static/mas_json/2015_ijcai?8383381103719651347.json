Particularly, we are interested in the completeness of data and its potential to provide concept definitions in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. In this work we propose a novel technique based on Formal Concept Analysis which organizes RDF data into a concept lattice. This allows data exploration as well as the discovery of implications, which are used to automatically detect missing information and then to complete RDF data. Moreover, this is a way of reconciling syntax and semantics in the LOD cloud. Finally, experiments on the DBpedia knowledge base show that the approach is wellfounded and effective.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Lorraine", "University of Lorraine", "University of Lorraine", "University of Lorraine"], "authors": ["Mehwish Alam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alam:Mehwish", "Aleksey Buzmakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buzmakov:Aleksey", "V\u00edctor Codocedo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Codocedo:V=iacute=ctor", "Amedeo Napoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Napoli:Amedeo"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
