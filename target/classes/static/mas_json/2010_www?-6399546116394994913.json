{"title": "A generalized framework of exploring category information for question retrieval in community question answer archives.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "world wide web", "categorization", "question answering", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular type of service where users ask and answer questions and access historical question-answer pairs. CQA archives contain very large volumes of questions organized into a hierarchy of categories. As an essential function of CQA services, question retrieval in a CQA archive aims to retrieve historical question-answer pairs that are relevant to a query question. In this paper, we present a new approach to exploiting category information of questions for improving the performance of question retrieval, and we apply the approach to existing question retrieval models, including a state-of-the-art question retrieval model. Experiments conducted on real CQA data demonstrate that the proposed techniques are capable of outperforming a variety of baseline methods significantly.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Peking University", "Aalborg University"], "authors": ["Xin Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xin", "Gao Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Gao", "Bin Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui_0001:Bin", "Christian S.
