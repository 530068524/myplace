{"title": "Distributed Tree Kernels.", "fields": ["kernel", "spacetime", "tree kernel", "computation", "dot product"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the distributed tree kernels (DTK) as a novel method to reduce time and space complexity of tree kernels. Using a linear complexity algorithm to compute vectors for trees, we embed feature spaces of tree fragments in low-dimensional spaces where the kernel computation is directly done with dot product. We show that DTKs are faster, correlate with tree kernels, and obtain a statistically similar performance in two natural language processing tasks.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Rome Tor Vergata", "University of Rome Tor Vergata"], "authors": ["Fabio Massimo Zanzotto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zanzotto:Fabio_Massimo", "Lorenzo Dell'Arciprete.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dell=Arciprete:Lorenzo"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
