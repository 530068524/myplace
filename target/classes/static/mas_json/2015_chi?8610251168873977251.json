{"title": "G-raff: An Elevating Tangible Block for Spatial Tabletop Interaction.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "augmented reality", "mobile device", "computer science"], "abstract": "We present an elevating tangible block, G-raff that supports spatial interaction in a tabletop computing environment. The elevating head part of G-raff moves according to the given height and angle data. We adopted two rollable metal tape structures to create large movements with a small volume block. On the head part, a smartphone can be mounted either horizontally or vertically. G-raff becomes a device that can connect a mobile device with a tabletop computer, thus a new spatial representation and control interaction is made. This paper introduces the design details, key features and applications of G-raff. We report on the results of a preliminary user study and discuss future work to improve the elevating device. This work contributes to maximizing the availability of augmented reality space above the tabletop display.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chang-Min Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Chang=Min", "Tek-Jin Nam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nam:Tek=Jin"], "pages": 4}
