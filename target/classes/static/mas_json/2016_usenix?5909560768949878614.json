{"title": "SLIK: Scalable Low-Latency Indexes for a Key-Value Store.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "associative array", "high availability", "scalability", "low latency"], "abstract": "Many large-scale key-value storage systems sacrifice features like secondary indexing and/or consistency in favor of scalability or performance. This limits the ease and efficiency of application development on such systems. Implementing secondary indexing in a large-scale memory based system is challenging because the goals for low latency, high scalability, consistency and high availability often conflict with each other. This paper shows how a large-scale key-value storage system can be extended to provide secondary indexes while meeting those goals. The architecture, called SLIK, enables multiple secondary indexes for each table. SLIK represents index B+ trees using objects in the underlying key-value store. It allows indexes to be partitioned and distributed independently of the data in tables while providing reasonable consistency guarantees using a lightweight ordered write approach. Our implementation of this design on RAMCloud (a main memory key-value store) performs indexed reads in 11 \u00b5s and writes in 30 \u00b5s. The architecture supports indexes spanning thousands of nodes, and provides linear scalability for throughput.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Ankita Kejriwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kejriwal:Ankita", "Arjun Gopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalan:Arjun", "Ashish Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Ashish", "Zhihao Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Zhihao", "Stephen Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Stephen", "John K.
