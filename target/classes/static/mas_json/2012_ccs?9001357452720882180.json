{"title": "Non-tracking web analytics.", "fields": ["web analytics", "path analysis", "software analytics", "semantic analytics", "web intelligence"], "abstract": "Today, websites commonly use third party web analytics services t obtain aggregate information about users that visit their sites. This information includes demographics and visits to other sites as well as user behavior within their own sites. Unfortunately, to obtain this aggregate information, web analytics services track individual user browsing behavior across the web. This violation of user privacy has been strongly criticized, resulting in tools that block such tracking as well as anti-tracking legislation and standards such as Do-Not-Track. These efforts, while improving user privacy, degrade the quality of web analytics. This paper presents the first design of a system that provides web analytics without tracking. The system gives users differential privacy guarantees, can provide better quality analytics than current services, requires no new organizational players, and is practical to deploy. This paper describes and analyzes the design, gives performance benchmarks, and presents our implementation and deployment across several hundred users.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Twitter", "Max Planck Society", "Cornell University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Istemi Ekin Akkus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akkus:Istemi_Ekin", "Ruichuan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ruichuan", "Michaela Hardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardt:Michaela", "Paul Francis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Francis:Paul", "Johannes Gehrke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehrke:Johannes"], "pages": 12}
