We characterize the relation between attack semantics and Dung's approach, and we define an SCC recursive algorithm for attack semantics using attack labelings.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Turin", "University of Luxembourg"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Serena Villata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villata:Serena", "Guido Boella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boella:Guido", "Leendert W.
