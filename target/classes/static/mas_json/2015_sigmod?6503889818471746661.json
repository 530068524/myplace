{"title": "The LDBC Social Network Benchmark: Interactive Workload.", "fields": ["linked data", "workload", "graph database", "data management", "benchmarking"], "abstract": "The Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC) is now two years underway and has gathered strong industrial participation for its mission to establish benchmarks, and benchmarking practices for evaluating graph data management systems. The LDBC introduced a new  choke-point  driven methodology for developing benchmark workloads, which combines user input with input from expert systems architects, which we outline. This paper describes the LDBC Social Network Benchmark (SNB), and presents database benchmarking innovation in terms of graph query functionality tested, correlated graph generation techniques, as well as a scalable benchmark driver on a workload with complex graph dependencies. SNB has three query workloads under development: Interactive, Business Intelligence, and Graph Algorithms. We describe the SNB Interactive Workload in detail and illustrate the workload with some early results, as well as the goals for the two other workloads.", "citation": "Citations (116)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["OpenLink Software", "Oracle Corporation", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Neo Technology, ... ockholm, Sweden", "Sparsity Techno ... arcelona, Spain"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Orri Erling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erling:Orri", "Alex Averbuch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Averbuch:Alex", "Josep-Llu\u00eds Larriba-Pey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larriba=Pey:Josep=Llu=iacute=s", "Hassan Chafi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chafi:Hassan", "Andrey Gubichev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gubichev:Andrey", "Arnau Prat-P\u00e9rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prat=P=eacute=rez:Arnau", "Minh-Duc Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Minh=Duc", "Peter A.
