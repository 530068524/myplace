A user generally needs to write separate queries and data definition statements to combine transposition with aggregation. With that motivation in mind, we introduce horizontal aggregations, a complementary class of aggregations to traditional (vertical) SQL aggregations. The SQL syntax extension is minimal and it significantly enhances the expressive power and ease of use of SQL. Our proposed SQL extension blurs the boundary between row values and column names. We present a prototype query optimizer that can evaluate arbitrary nested queries combining filtering, joins and both classes of aggregations. Horizontal aggregations have many applications in ad-hoc querying, OLAP cube processing and data mining. We demonstrate query optimization of horizontal aggregations introduces new research challenges.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Houston", "National Autonomous University of Mexico", "University of Houston"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Carlos Ordonez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ordonez_0001:Carlos", "Javier Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garc=iacute=a=Garc=iacute=a_0001:Javier", "Zhibo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0002:Zhibo"], "pages": 4}
