{"title": "CrowdService: serving the individuals through mobile crowdsourcing and service composition.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "crowdsourcing software development", "mobile web", "android", "mobile search"], "abstract": "Some user needs in real life can only be accomplished by leveraging the intelligence and labor of other people via crowdsourcing tasks. For example, one may want to confirm the validity of the description of a secondhand laptop by asking someone else to inspect the laptop on site. To integrate these crowdsourcing tasks into user applications, it is required that crowd intelligence and labor be provided as easily accessible services (e.g., Web services), which can be called crowd services. In this paper, we develop a framework named CROWDSERVICE which supplies crowd intelligence and labor as publicly accessible crowd services via mobile crowdsourcing. We implement the proposed framework on the Android platform and evaluate the usability of the framework with a user study.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Open University"], "authors": ["Xin Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Xin", "Jingxiao Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Jingxiao", "Tian Huat Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Tian_Huat", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Yijun Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yijun", "Bashar Nuseibeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nuseibeh:Bashar", "Wenyun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wenyun"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2016", "pages": 6}
