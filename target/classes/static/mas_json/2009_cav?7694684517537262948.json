In the deterministic setting, we consider total-payoff games which have been introduced as a refinement of mean-payoff games [10, 18]. In the stochastic setting, our class is a turn-based variant of liminf-payoff games [4, 15, 16]. In both settings, we provide a non-trivial characterization of the values through nested fixpoint equations. The characterization of the values of liminf-payoff games moreover shows that solving liminf-payoff games is polynomial-time reducible to solving stochastic parity games. We construct practical algorithms for solving the occurring nested fixpoint equations based on strategy iteration. As a corollary we obtain that solving deterministic total-payoff games and solving stochastic liminf-payoff games is in UP *** co*** UP.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Thomas Gawlitza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gawlitza:Thomas", "Helmut Seidl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidl:Helmut"], "pages": 15}
