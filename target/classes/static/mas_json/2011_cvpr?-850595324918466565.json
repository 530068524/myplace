{"title": "A robust method for vector field learning with application to mismatch removing.", "fields": ["kernel", "regularization", "reproducing kernel hilbert space", "maximum a posteriori estimation", "latent variable"], "abstract": "We propose a method for vector field learning with outliers, called vector field consensus (VFC). It could distinguish inliers from outliers and learn a vector field fitting for the inliers simultaneously. A prior is taken to force the smoothness of the field, which is based on the Tiknonov regularization in vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Under a Bayesian framework, we associate each sample with a latent variable which indicates whether it is an inlier, and then formulate the problem as maximum a posteriori problem and use Expectation Maximization algorithm to solve it. The proposed method possesses two characteristics: 1) robust to outliers, and being able to tolerate 90% outliers and even more, 2) computationally efficient. As an application, we apply VFC to solve the problem of mismatch removing. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art methods, and it is very robust.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ji Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Ji", "Jiayi Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma_0001:Jiayi", "Jinwen Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Jinwen", "Jie Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Jie", "Dazhi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dazhi"], "pages": 8}
