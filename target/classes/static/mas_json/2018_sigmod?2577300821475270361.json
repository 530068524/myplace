{"title": "Trip Planning by an Integrated Search Paradigm.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "front and back ends", "data mining", "database", "visualization"], "abstract": "In this paper, we build a trip planning system called TISP, which enables user's interactive exploration of POIs and trajectories in their incremental trip planning. At the back end, TISP is able to support seven types of common queries over spatial-only, spatial-textual and textual-only data, based on our proposed unified indexing and search paradigm [7]. At the front end, we propose novel visualisation designs to present the result of different types of queries; our user-friendly interaction designs allow users to construct further queries without inputting any text.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["RMIT University", "RMIT University", "RMIT University", "RMIT University", "RMIT University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0007:Sheng", "Mingzhao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mingzhao", "Yipeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yipeng", "Zhifeng Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Zhifeng", "David Alexander Tedjopurnomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tedjopurnomo:David_Alexander", "Xiaolin Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Xiaolin"], "pages": 4}
