However,\nthe computational demands of the KBR scale poorly\nwith the number of samples and the KBR often suffers from\nnumerical instabilities. In this paper, we present the kernel\nKalman rule (KKR) as an alternative to the KBR. The derivation\nof the KKR is based on recursive least squares, inspired\nby the derivation of the Kalman innovation update. We apply\nthe KKR to filtering tasks where we use RKHS embeddings\nto represent the belief state, resulting in the kernel Kalman filter\n(KKF). We show on a nonlinear state estimation task with\nhigh dimensional observations that our approach provides a\nsignificantly improved estimation accuracy while the computational\ndemands are significantly decreased.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "National University of Singapore", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Gregor H.
