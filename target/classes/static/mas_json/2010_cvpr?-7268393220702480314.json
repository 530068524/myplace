{"title": "Cascaded L1-norm Minimization Learning (CLML) classifier for human detection.", "fields": ["vc dimension", "test set", "penalty method", "integer programming", "feature selection"], "abstract": "This paper proposes a new learning method, which integrates feature selection with classifier construction for human detection via solving three optimization models. Firstly, the method trains a series of weak-classifiers by the proposed L1-norm Minimization Learning (LML) and min-max penalty function models. Secondly, the proposed method selects the weak-classifiers by using the integer optimization model to construct a strong classifier. The L1-norm minimization and integer optimization models aim to find the minimal VC-dimension for weak and strong classifiers respectively. Finally, the method constructs a cascade of LML (CLML) classifier to reach higher detection rates and efficiency. Histograms of Oriented Gradients features of variable-size blocks (v-HOG) are employed as human representation to verify the proposed method. Experiments conducted on INRIA human test set show more superior detection rates and speed than state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Beihang University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ran Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ran", "Baochang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Baochang", "Qixiang Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Qixiang", "Jianbin Jiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiao:Jianbin"], "pages": 8}
