This has involved architecture-dependent optimizations of performance scaling and addressing code portability and energy issues, with the metrics for multi-platform comparisons being \"time-to-solution\" and \"energy-to-solution\". Realistic results addressing how confinement losses caused by plasma turbulence scale from present-day devices to the much larger $25 billion international ITER fusion facility have been enabled by innovative advances in the GTC-P code including (i) implementation of one-sided communication from MPI 3.0 standard; (ii) creative optimization techniques on Xeon Phi processors; and (iii) development of a novel performance model for the key kernels of the PIC code. Results show that modeling data movement is sufficient to predict performance on modern supercomputer platforms.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory", "Princeton University", "Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory", "Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland", "Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"], "authors": ["William M.
