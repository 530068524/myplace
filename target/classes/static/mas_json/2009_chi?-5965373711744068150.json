{"title": "Revealing gauguin: engaging visitors in robot guide's explanation in an art museum.", "fields": [], "abstract": "Designing technologies that support the explanation of museum exhibits is a challenging domain. In this paper we develop an innovative approach - providing a robot guide with resources to engage visitors in an interaction about an art exhibit. We draw upon ethnographical fieldwork in an art museum, focusing on how tour guides interrelate talk and visual conduct, specifically how they ask questions of different kinds to engage and involve visitors in lengthy explanations of an exhibit. From this analysis we have developed a robot guide that can coordinate its utterances and body movement to monitor the responses of visitors to these. Detailed analysis of the interaction between the robot and visitors in an art museum suggests that such simple devices derived from the study of human interaction might be useful in engaging visitors in explanations of complex artifacts.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Saitama University", "Tokyo University of Technology", "Saitama University", "Saitama University", "Saitama University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Keiichi Yamazaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamazaki:Keiichi", "Akiko Yamazaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamazaki:Akiko", "Mai Okada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okada:Mai", "Yoshinori Kuno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuno:Yoshinori", "Yoshinori Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Yoshinori", "Yosuke Hoshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoshi:Yosuke", "Karola Pitsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitsch:Karola", "Paul Luff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luff:Paul", "Dirk vom Lehn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehn:Dirk_vom", "Christian Heath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heath:Christian"], "pages": 10}
