We investigate the complexity of such networks by studying the number of linear regions of the PWL function. Typically, a PWL function from a DNN can be seen as a large family of linear functions acting on millions of such regions. We directly build upon the work of Mont\u00b4ufar et al. (2014), Mont\u00b4ufar (2017), and Raghu et al. (2017) by refining the upper and lower bounds on the number of linear regions for rectified and maxout networks. In addition to achieving tighter bounds, we also develop a novel method to perform exact numeration or counting of the number of linear regions with a mixed-integer linear formulation that maps the input space to output. We use this new capability to visualize how the number of linear regions change while training DNNs.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Utah"], "authors": ["Thiago Serra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serra:Thiago", "Christian Tjandraatmadja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tjandraatmadja:Christian", "Srikumar Ramalingam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramalingam:Srikumar"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
