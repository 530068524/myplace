TinyCasper  consists of two main modules,  in-network location anonymization and aggregate query processing over anonymized locations . In the first module, trusted  wireless sensor nodes  collaborate with each other to anonymize users' exact locations by a cloaked spatial region that satisfies a prespecified privacy requirement. On the other side, the  aggregate query processing  module collects and analyzes the cloaked spatial regions reported from the  wireless sensor nodes  to support  aggregate  and  alarm  queries over anonymized locations. The prototype of  TinyCasper  is implemented on a physical test-bed on the TinyOS/Mote platform with 39 MICAz motes.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Chi-Yin Chow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chow:Chi=Yin", "Mohamed F.
