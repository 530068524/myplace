{"title": "Almost tight bounds for rumour spreading with conductance.", "fields": ["connectivity", "binary logarithm", "existential quantification", "conductance", "notation"], "abstract": "We show that if a connected graph with $n$ nodes has conductance \u03c6 then rumour spreading, also known as randomized broadcast, successfully broadcasts a message within ~O(\u03c6 -1  \u2022 log n), many rounds with high probability, regardless of the source, by using the PUSH-PULL strategy. The ~O(\u2022\u2022) notation hides a polylog \u03c6 -1  factor. This result is almost tight since there exists graph of n nodes, and conductance \u03c6, with diameter \u03a9(\u03c6 -1  \u2022 log n). If, in addition, the network satisfies some kind of uniformity condition on the degrees, our analysis implies that both both PUSH and PULL, by themselves, successfully broadcast the message to every node in the same number of rounds.", "citation": "Citations (119)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Flavio Chierichetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chierichetti:Flavio", "Silvio Lattanzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lattanzi:Silvio", "Alessandro Panconesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panconesi:Alessandro"], "pages": 10}
