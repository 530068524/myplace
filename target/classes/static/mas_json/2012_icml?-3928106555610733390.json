{"title": "Output Space Search for Structured Prediction.", "fields": ["incremental heuristic search", "iterative deepening depth first search", "interpolation search", "beam search", "guided local search"], "abstract": "We consider a framework for structured prediction based on search in the space of complete structured outputs. Given a structured input, an output is produced by running a time-bounded search procedure guided by a learned cost function, and then returning the least cost output uncovered during the search. This framework can be instantiated for a wide range of search spaces and search procedures, and easily incorporates arbitrary structured-prediction loss functions. In this paper, we make two main technical contributions. First, we define the limited-discrepancy search space over structured outputs, which is able to leverage powerful classification learning algorithms to improve the search space quality. Second, we give a generic cost function learning approach, where the key idea is to learn a cost function that attempts to mimic the behavior of conducting searches guided by the true loss function. Our experiments on six benchmark domains demonstrate that using our framework with only a small amount of search is sufficient for significantly improving on state-of-the-art structured-prediction performance.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Janardhan Rao Doppa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doppa:Janardhan_Rao", "Alan Fern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fern:Alan", "Prasad Tadepalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tadepalli:Prasad"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
