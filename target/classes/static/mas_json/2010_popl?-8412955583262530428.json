Our analysis is a variant of Tarjan's manual  amortised cost analysis   technique. We use a type-based approach, exploiting linearity to allow inference, and place a new emphasis on the number of references to a data object. The bounds we infer depend on the sizes of the various inputs to a program. They thus expose the impact of specific inputs on the overall cost behaviour.   The key novel aspect of our work is that it deals directly with polymorphic higher-order functions  without requiring source-level transformations that could alter resource usage  . We thus obtain  safe   and  accurate   compile-time bounds. Our work is  generic   in that it deals with a variety of quantitative resources. We illustrate our approach with reference to dynamic memory allocations/deallocations, stack usage, and worst-case execution time, using metrics taken from a real implementation on a simple micro-controller platform that is used in safety-critical automotive applications.", "citation": "Citations (115)", "departments": ["University of St Andrews", "University of St Andrews", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "authors": ["Steffen Jost.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jost:Steffen", "Kevin Hammond.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hammond:Kevin", "Hans-Wolfgang Loidl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loidl:Hans=Wolfgang", "Martin Hofmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofmann_0001:Martin"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2010", "pages": 14}
