{"title": "PGWinFunc: Optimizing Window Aggregate Functions in PostgreSQL and its application for trajectory data.", "fields": ["relational database", "traffic flow", "aggregate function", "data visualization", "sql"], "abstract": "In modern cities, more and more people drive the vehicles, equipped with the GPS devices, which create a large scale of trajectories. Gathering and analyzing these large-scale trajectory data provide a new opportunity to understand the city dynamics and to reveal the hidden social and economic phenomena. This paper designs and implements a tool, named as PGWinFunc, to analyze trajectory data by extending a traditional relational database. Firstly we introduce some efficient query process and optimization methods for SQL Window Aggregate Functions in PostgreSQL. Secondly, we present how to mine the LBS (Location-Based Service) patterns, such as the average speed and traffic flow, from the large-scale trajectories with SQL expression with Window Aggregate Functions. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of the PGWinFunc tool are demonstrated and we also visualized the results by BAIDU MAP.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "EMC Labs, Beijing, China"], "authors": ["Jiansong Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Jiansong", "Yu Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yu", "Xiaoling Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaoling", "Chaoyong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chaoyong", "Cheqing Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Cheqing", "Aoying Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Aoying"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
