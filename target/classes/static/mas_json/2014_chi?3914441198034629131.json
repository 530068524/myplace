{"title": "Interactively stylizing camera motion.", "fields": ["motion interpolation", "cinematography", "match moving", "camera auto calibration", "video tracking"], "abstract": "Movie directors and cinematographers impart style onto video using techniques that are learned through years of experience: camera movement, framing, color, lighting, etc. Without this experience and expensive equipment, it is very difficult to control stylistic aspects of a video. We introduce a novel approach for post-hoc editing of one specific aspect of cinematography -- camera motion style -- via an equalizer-like set of controls that manipulates the power spectra of a video's apparent motion path. We explore free manipulation of apparent camera motion as well as the transfer of motion styles from an example video to a new video to create a wide range of stylistic variations. We report on a user study confirming the ability of non-expert users to create motion styles.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Neel Joshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joshi:Neel", "Dan Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Dan", "Michael F.
