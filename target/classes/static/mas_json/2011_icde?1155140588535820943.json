{"title": "Preference-based datacube analysis with MYOLAP.", "fields": ["operator", "online analytical processing", "java", "data cube", "data visualization"], "abstract": "In this demonstration we present MYOLAP, a Java-based tool that allows OLAP analyses to be personalized and enhanced by expressing \u201csoft\u201d query constraints in the form of user preferences. MYOLAP is based on a novel preference algebra and a preference evaluation algorithm specifically devised for the OLAP domain. Preferences are formulated either visually or through an extension of the MDX language, and user interaction with the results is mediated by a visual graph-like structure that shows better-than relationships between different sets of data. The demonstration will show how analysis sessions can benefit from coupling ad-hoc preference constructors with the classical OLAP operators, and in particular how MYOLAP supports users in expressing preference queries, analyzing their results, and navigating datacubes.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Bologna", "University of Bologna", "University of Bologna"], "authors": ["Paolo Biondi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biondi:Paolo", "Matteo Golfarelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golfarelli:Matteo", "Stefano Rizzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rizzi:Stefano"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
