High-resolution global wave model plays a key role in accurate surface wave forecasting. However, operational forecasting systems are still not in high-resolution due to entailed high demand for large computation, as well as low parallel efficiency barrier. Here breakthroughs encompassing the design and application of irregular quasi-rectangular domain decomposition, master-slave cooperative computing workflow and pipelining scheme were applied to a global wave model, which has been used in several operational forecasting systems and earth system models. Our realistic surface wave simulations on Sunway TaihuLight Supercomputer demonstrated that our model had outstanding scalability and achieved 45.43 PFlops in ultra-high resolution of (1/100)\u00b0, using full-scale supercomputer with 10,649,600 cores. That provides a highly effective solution for accurate surface wave forecasting and climate change prediction.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["State Oceanic Administration", "State Oceanic Administration", "State Oceanic Administration", "Tsinghua University", "National Resear ...
