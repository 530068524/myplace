{"title": "Disturbed System: Recreating Sculptor's Experience ofTheir Medium With Haptics and Generated Sound.", "fields": ["haptic technology", "visitor pattern", "sculpture", "aura", "sensation"], "abstract": "This paper discusses a collaborative project that inquires about the possibilities of the tactile sensation in art and its ability to reestablish human sensory relationships with consumer technology. It introduces the visitor to the interaction style practiced by the artists with their medium. The described interactive sculpture predisposes the visitor to explore tactile interaction as an aesthetic experience within multimodal multisensory system. Disturbed System takes the visitor's experience with the artwork into unfamiliar sensory territory. Touching the soft silicone surface of the sculpture provides electronic feedback of embedded vibration and directional spatialized sound in an installation format. The artwork presents this sensory information in a form of unexpected assemblage of pulsing organic sculptural surfaces and emitting sound. It also places visitors in a shared interactive space, an aura of traveling sound warped by their touch of the sculpture. This shared interaction investigates relationships between nature, artifice, technology, human body and human social group behavior.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Oksana Krzyhanivska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krzyhanivska:Oksana", "Simon Fay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fay:Simon", "Jeffrey E.
