A lot of recent effort has been devoted to developing distributed algorithms for these problems. However, these results suffer from high number of rounds, suboptimal approximation ratios, or both. We develop a framework for bringing existing algorithms in the sequential setting to the distributed setting, achieving near optimal approximation ratios for many settings in only a constant number of MapReduce rounds. Our techniques also give a fast sequential algorithm for non-monotone maximization subject to a matroid constraint.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "University of Warwick", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Rafael da Ponte Barbosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbosa:Rafael_da_Ponte", "Alina Ene.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ene:Alina", "Huy L.
