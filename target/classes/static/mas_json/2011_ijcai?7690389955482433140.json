{"title": "A System for Providing Differentiated QoS in Retail Banking.", "fields": ["customer intelligence", "customer reference program", "customer to customer", "customer profitability", "voice of the customer"], "abstract": "In today's services driven economic environment, it is imperative for organizations to provide better quality service experience to differentiate and grow their business. Customer satisfaction (C-SAT) is the key driver for retention and growth in Retail Banking. Wait time, the time spent by a customer at the branch before getting serviced, contributes significantly to C-SAT. Due to high footfall, it is improbable to improve the wait time of every customer walking in the branch. Therefore, banks in developing countries are strategically looking to segment its customers and services and offer differentiated QoS based service delivery. In this work, we present a system for customer segmentation, and scheduling based on historic value of the customer and characteristics of current service request. We describe the system and give mathematical formulation of the scheduling problem and the associated heuristics. We present results and experience of deployment of this solution in multiple branches of a leading bank in India.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Google"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Sameep Mehta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehta:Sameep", "Girish Chafle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chafle:Girish", "Gyana R.
