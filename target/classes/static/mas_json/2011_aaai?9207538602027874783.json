{"title": "Balancing Safety and Exploitability in Opponent Modeling.", "fields": ["fictitious play", "finite set", "adversary", "exploit", "minimax"], "abstract": "Opponent modeling is a critical mechanism in repeated games. It allows a player to adapt its strategy in order to better respond to the presumed preferences of his opponents. We introduce a new modeling technique that adaptively balances exploitability and risk reduction. An opponent's strategy is modeled with a set of possible strategies that contain the actual strategy with a high probability. The algorithm is safe as the expected payoff is above the minimax payoff with a high probability, and can exploit the opponents' preferences when sufficient observations have been obtained. We apply them to normal-form games and stochastic games with a finite number of stages. The performance of the proposed approach is first demonstrated on repeated rock-paper-scissors games. Subsequently, the approach is evaluated in a human-robot table-tennis setting where the robot player learns to prepare to return a served ball. By modeling the human players, the robot chooses a forehand, backhand or middle preparation pose before they serve. The learned strategies can exploit the opponent's preferences, leading to a higher rate of successful returns.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Zhikun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhikun", "Abdeslam Boularias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boularias:Abdeslam", "Katharina M\u00fclling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=lling:Katharina", "Jan Peters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peters_0001:Jan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
