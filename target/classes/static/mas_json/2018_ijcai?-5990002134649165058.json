However, the large number of feature dimensions, e.g., usually larger than 10^7, results in expensive storage and computational cost. This prohibits fast recommendation especially on mobile applications where the computational resource is very limited. In this paper, we develop a generic feature-based recommendation model, called Discrete Factorization Machine (DFM), for fast and accurate recommendation. DFM binarizes the real-valued model parameters (e.g., float32) of every feature embedding into binary codes (e.g., boolean), and thus supports efficient storage and fast user-item score computation. To avoid the severe quantization loss of the binarization, we propose a convergent updating rule that resolves the challenging discrete optimization of DFM. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we show that 1) DFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art binarized recommendation models, and 2) DFM shows very competitive performance compared to its real-valued version (FM), demonstrating the minimized quantization loss.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shandong University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Shandong University", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Han", "Xiangnan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Xiangnan", "Fuli Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Fuli", "Liqiang Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Liqiang", "Rui Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Rui", "Hanwang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hanwang"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
