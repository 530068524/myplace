Enterprises are taking a hard look at this open, unmediated platform because the community effect generated on this channel can have a telling effect on their brand image, potential market opportunity and customer loyalty. In this work we present our experiences in building a system that mines conversations on social platforms to identify and prioritize those posts and messages that are relevant to enterprises. The system presented in this work aims to empower an agent or a representative in an enterprise to monitor, track and respond to customer communication while also encouraging community participation.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Jitendra Ajmera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ajmera:Jitendra", "Hyung-Il Ahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahn:Hyung=Il", "Meena Nagarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagarajan:Meena", "Ashish Verma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verma:Ashish", "Danish Contractor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Contractor:Danish", "Stephen Dill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dill:Stephen", "Matthew Denesuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denesuk:Matthew"], "conf": "www", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
