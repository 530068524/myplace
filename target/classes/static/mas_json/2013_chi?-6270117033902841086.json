We use ethnographic methods to study the recent adoption and use of mobile technology and discuss our findings in relation to the evolving materiality of music. We also investigate the sociotechnical configurations that emerge as a consequence of this materiality. Thus we contribute to HCI research by showing how the material representations of digital media affect the interactions of humans with technology.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Neha Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Neha", "Tapan S.
