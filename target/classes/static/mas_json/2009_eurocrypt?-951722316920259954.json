{"title": "Verifiable Random Functions from Identity-Based Key Encapsulation.", "fields": ["key encapsulation", "random oracle", "ciphertext", "verifiable secret sharing", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We propose a methodology to construct verifiable random functions from a class of identity based key encapsulation mechanisms (IB-KEM) that we call VRF suitable. Informally, an IB-KEM is VRF suitable if it provides what we call  unique decryption  (i.e. given a ciphertext  C  produced with respect to an identity ${\\it{ID}}$, all the secret keys corresponding to identity ${\\it{ID}}'$, decrypt to the same value, even if ${\\it{ID}}\\neq {\\it{ID}}'$) and it satisfies an additional property that we call pseudorandom decapsulation. In a nutshell, pseudorandom decapsulation means that if one decrypts a ciphertext  C  , produced with respect to an identity ${\\it{ID}}$, using the decryption key corresponding to any other identity ${\\it{ID}}'$ the resulting value looks random to a polynomially bounded observer. Interestingly, we show that most known IB-KEMs already achieve pseudorandom decapsulation. Our construction is of interest both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. Indeed, apart from establishing a connection between two seemingly unrelated primitives, our methodology is  direct  in the sense that, in contrast to most previous constructions, it avoids the inefficient Goldreich-Levin hardcore bit transformation.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "University of Catania", "University of Catania"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Michel Abdalla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdalla:Michel", "Dario Catalano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catalano:Dario", "Dario Fiore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiore:Dario"], "pages": 18}
