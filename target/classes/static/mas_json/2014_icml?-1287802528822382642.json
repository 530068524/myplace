However, despite being scalable to large datasets they do not take full advantage of the extra data due to their linear nature, and we believe they typically underfit. We propose a new class of models which aim to provide improved performance while retaining many of the benefits of the existing class of embedding models. Our approach works by reweighting each component of the embedding of features and labels with a potentially nonlinear affinity function. We describe several variants of the family, and show its usefulness on several datasets.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jason Weston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weston:Jason", "Ron J.
