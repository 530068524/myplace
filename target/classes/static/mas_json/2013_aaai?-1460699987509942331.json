{"title": "An Optimal Task Assignment Policy and Performance Diagnosis Strategy for Heterogeneous Hadoop Cluster.", "fields": ["scheduling", "distributed computing", "computer science", "software"], "abstract": "The goal of the proposed research is to improve the performance of Hadoop-based software running on a heterogeneous cluster. My approach lies in the intersection of machine learning, scheduling and diagnosis. We mainly focus on heterogeneous Hadoop clusters and try to improve the performance by implementing a more efficient scheduler for this class of cluster.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["PARC"], "authors": ["Shekhar Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Shekhar"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
