Unlike most existing techniques that involve repetition of the randomized algorithm and hence a slowdown, our techniques produce algorithms with a similar run-time to the original randomized algorithms. The amplification technique is related to a certain stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. The derandomization technique - which is the main contribution of this work - points to an intriguing connection between derandomization and sketching/sparsification. We demonstrate the techniques by showing algorithms for approximating free games (constraint satisfaction problems on dense bipartite graphs).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Ofer Grossman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grossman:Ofer", "Dana Moshkovitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moshkovitz:Dana"], "pages": 10}
