{"title": "Decomposition-Invariant Conditional Gradient for General Polytopes with Line Search.", "fields": ["line search", "condition number", "pairwise comparison", "polytope", "invariant"], "abstract": "Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithms with linear convergence rates have recently achieved great efficiency in many applications. Garber and Meshi (2016) designed a new decomposition-invariant pairwise FW variant with favorable dependency on the domain geometry. Unfortunately, it applies only to a restricted class of polytopes and cannot achieve theoretical and practical efficiency at the same time. In this paper, we show that by employing an away-step update, similar rates can be generalized to arbitrary polytopes with strong empirical performance. A new \"condition number\" of the domain is introduced which allows leveraging the sparsity of the solution. We applied the method to a reformulation of SVM, and the linear convergence rate depends, for the first time, on the number of support vectors.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Mohammad Ali Bashiri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bashiri:Mohammad_Ali", "Xinhua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xinhua"], "pages": 11}
