{"title": "On Speculative Enactments.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "design research", "design fiction", "design methods", "computer science"], "abstract": "Speculative Enactments are a novel approach to speculative design research with participants. They invite the empirical analysis of participants acting amidst speculative but consequential circumstances. HCI as a broadly pragmatic, experience-centered, and participant-focused field is well placed to innovate methods that invite first-hand interaction and experience with speculative design projects. We discuss three case studies of this approach in practice, based on our own work: Runner Spotters, Metadating and a Quantified Wedding. In distinguishing Speculative Enactments we offer not just practical guidelines, but a set of conceptual resources for researchers and practitioners to critique the different contributions that speculative approaches make to HCI discourse.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Northumbria University", "Newcastle University", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chris Elsden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elsden:Chris", "David J.
