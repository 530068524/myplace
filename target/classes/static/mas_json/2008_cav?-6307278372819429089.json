Distinguishing features of our type system are: it can verify lock-freedom of concurrent programs that have sophisticated recursive communication structures; it can be fully automated; it is hybrid, in that it combines a type system for lock-freedom with local reasoning about deadlock-freedom, termination, and confluence analyses. Moreover, the type system is parameterized by deadlock-freedom/termination/confluence analyses, so that any methods (e.g. type systems and model checking) can be used for those analyses. A lock-freedom analysis tool has been implemented based on the proposed type system, and tested for nontrivial programs.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Tohoku University", "University of Bologna", "Tohoku University", "University of Bologna"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Naoki Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi_0001:Naoki", "Davide Sangiorgi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sangiorgi:Davide"], "pages": 14}
