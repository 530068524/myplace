In this paper, we study a new social influence problem, called  personalized social tags exploration  (PITEX), to help any user in the SN explore how she influences the network. Given a target user, it finds a size-k tag set that maximizes this user's social influence. We prove the problem is NP-hard to be approximated within any constant ratio. To solve it, we introduce a sampling-based framework, which has an approximation ratio of 1-e over 1+e with high probabilistic guarantee. To speedup the computation, we devise more efficient sampling techniques and propose best-effort exploration to quickly prune tag sets with small influence. To further enable instant exploration, we devise a novel index structure and develop effective pruning and materialization techniques. Experimental results on real large-scale datasets validate our theoretical findings and show high performances of our proposed methods.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Renmin University of China", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yuchen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuchen", "Ju Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Ju", "Dongxiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dongxiang", "Kian-Lee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian=Lee"], "pages": 16}
