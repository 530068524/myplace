{"title": "A New Representation of Skeleton Sequences for 3D Action Recognition.", "fields": ["clips", "convolutional neural network", "human skeleton", "feature learning", "skeleton"], "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for 3D action recognition with skeleton sequences (i.e., 3D trajectories of human skeleton joints). The proposed method first transforms each skeleton sequence into three clips each consisting of several frames for spatial temporal feature learning using deep neural networks. Each clip is generated from one channel of the cylindrical coordinates of the skeleton sequence. Each frame of the generated clips represents the temporal information of the entire skeleton sequence, and incorporates one particular spatial relationship between the joints. The entire clips include multiple frames with different spatial relationships, which provide useful spatial structural information of the human skeleton. We propose to use deep convolutional neural networks to learn long-term temporal information of the skeleton sequence from the frames of the generated clips, and then use a Multi-Task Learning Network (MTLN) to jointly process all frames of the clips in parallel to incorporate spatial structural information for action recognition. Experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed new representation and feature learning method for 3D action recognition.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Murdoch University", "University of Western Australia", "School of Physi ... ics & Computing", "School of Physi ... ics & Computing", "School of Physi ... ics & Computing"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Qiuhong Ke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ke:Qiuhong", "Mohammed Bennamoun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bennamoun:Mohammed", "Senjian An.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/An:Senjian", "Ferdous Ahmed Sohel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sohel:Ferdous_Ahmed", "Farid Boussa\u00efd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boussa=iuml=d:Farid"], "pages": 10}
