It also attracts scams, for example, Ponzi scheme, a classic fraud, has been found making a notable amount of money on Blockchain, which has a very negative impact. To help dealing with this issue, this paper proposes an approach to detect Ponzi schemes on blockchain by using data mining and machine learning methods. By verifying smart contracts on Ethereum, we first extract features from user accounts and operation codes of the smart contracts and then build a classification model to detect latent Ponzi schemes implemented as smart contracts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve high accuracy for practical use. More importantly, the approach can be used to detect Ponzi schemes even at the moment of its creation. By using the proposed approach, we estimate that there are more than 400 Ponzi schemes running on Ethereum. Based on these results, we propose to build a uniform platform to evaluate and monitor every created smart contract for early warning of scams.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Uppsala University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Weili Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Weili", "Zibin Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Zibin", "Jiahui Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Jiahui", "Edith C.
