In this paper we focus on the problem of clustering individual transactional data for a large mass of users. Transactional data is a very pervasive kind of information that is collected by several services, often involving huge pools of users. We propose  txmeans , a parameter-free clustering algorithm able to efficiently partitioning transactional data in a completely automatic way.  Txmeans  is designed for the case where clustering must be applied on a massive number of different datasets, for instance when a large set of users need to be analyzed individually and each of them has generated a long history of transactions. A deep experimentation on both real and synthetic datasets shows the practical effectiveness of  txmeans  for the mass clustering of different personal datasets, and suggests that  txmeans  outperforms existing methods in terms of quality and efficiency. Finally, we present a  personal cart  assistant application based on  txmeans", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Pisa", "University of Pisa", "Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione", "Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione", "University of Pisa"], "authors": ["Riccardo Guidotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guidotti:Riccardo", "Anna Monreale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monreale:Anna", "Mirco Nanni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nanni:Mirco", "Fosca Giannotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giannotti:Fosca", "Dino Pedreschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedreschi:Dino"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
