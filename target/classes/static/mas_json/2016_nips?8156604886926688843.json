Inherent to the model is a novel Bayesian nonparametric prior that ties and shrinks parameters in a powerful way. We develop theory about the model's infinite limit and its steady-state. The model's inductive bias is demonstrated on a variety of real-world datasets where it is shown to learn interpretable structure and have superior predictive performance.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Microsoft", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Aaron Schein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schein:Aaron", "Hanna M.
