We interviewed middle to upper class, suburban, white American parents and low-income, urban, African-American parents to understand how each group incorporates technology into their lives. Participants had teens in their homes and devices like computers and cell phones played a powerful and preeminent role in family life. Our results show that socioeconomic differences both reflect and reinforce technology use at home. Specifically, low socioeconomic status families share devices more often and low socioeconomic status teens have more responsibility and independence in their technology use. We argue that that as low socioeconomic status families become the majority demographic, the CHI community needs to better understand how to design for these groups.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sarita Yardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yardi:Sarita", "Amy Bruckman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruckman:Amy"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
