{"title": "Sparse Space-Time Deconvolution for Calcium Image Analysis.", "fields": ["heuristic", "deconvolution", "synthetic data", "impulse", "sparse approximation"], "abstract": "We describe a unified formulation and algorithm to find an extremely sparse representation for Calcium image sequences in terms of cell locations, cell shapes, spike timings and impulse responses. Solution of a single optimization problem yields cell segmentations and activity estimates that are on par with the state of the art, without the need for heuristic pre- or postprocessing. Experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing", "Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ferran Diego Andilla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andilla:Ferran_Diego", "Fred A.
