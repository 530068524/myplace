If the behavior and the extent of such an influence, a sort of illusion, are investigated in detail, the objects composed of a limited variety of materials can be perceived differently. This would be useful in the field of digital engineering. Therefore, we performed various experiments systematically.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University"], "authors": ["Akiko Iesaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iesaki:Akiko", "Akihiro Somada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Somada:Akihiro", "Asako Kimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimura:Asako", "Fumihisa Shibata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shibata:Fumihisa", "Hideyuki Tamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamura:Hideyuki"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
