Despite much recent work on word alignment methods, alignment accuracy increases often produce little or no improvements in machine translation quality. In this work we analyze a recently proposed agreement-constrained EM algorithm for unsupervised alignment models. We attempt to tease apart the effects that this simple but effective modification has on alignment precision and recall trade-offs, and how rare and common words are affected across several language pairs. We propose and extensively evaluate a simple method for using alignment models to produce alignments better-suited for phrase-based MT systems, and show significant gains (as measured by BLEU score) in end-to-end translation systems for six languages pairs used in recent MT competitions.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "INESC-ID", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kuzman Ganchev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganchev:Kuzman", "Jo\u00e3o Gra\u00e7a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gra=ccedil=a:Jo=atilde=o", "Ben Taskar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taskar:Ben"], "pages": 8}
