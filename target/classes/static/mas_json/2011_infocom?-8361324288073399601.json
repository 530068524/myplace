This paper investigates how much can be saved by dynamically \"right-sizing\" the data center by turning off servers during such periods and how to achieve that saving via an online algorithm. We propose a very general model and prove that the optimal offline algorithm for dynamic right-sizing has a simple structure when viewed in reverse time, and this structure is exploited to develop a new \"lazy\" online algorithm, which is proven to be 3-competitive. We validate the algorithm using traces from two real data-center workloads and show that significant cost savings are possible. Additionally, we contrast this new algorithm with the more traditional approach of receding horizon control.", "citation": "Citations (633)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Microsoft", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Minghong Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Minghong", "Adam Wierman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wierman:Adam", "Lachlan L.
