Although there has been work on extracting action scripts, instructions, navigation actions, etc., they require either the set of candidate actions is provided in advance, or action descriptions are restricted in a specific form, e.g., description templates. In this paper, we aim to extract action sequences from texts in free natural language, i.e., without any restricted templates, provided the candidate set of actions is unknown. We propose to extract action sequences from texts based on the deep reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we view \"selecting\" or \"eliminating\" words from texts as \"actions\", and texts associated with actions as \"states\". We then build Q-networks to learn the policy of extracting actions and extract plans from the labelled texts. We exhibit the effectiveness of our approach in several datasets with comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, including online experiments interacting with humans.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Wenfeng Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Wenfeng", "Hankz Hankui Zhuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuo:Hankz_Hankui", "Subbarao Kambhampati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kambhampati:Subbarao"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
