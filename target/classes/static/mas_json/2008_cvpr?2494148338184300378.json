{"title": "Closing the loop in scene interpretation.", "fields": ["statistical classification", "object detection", "image registration", "pixel", "robot kinematics"], "abstract": "Image understanding involves analyzing many different aspects of the scene. In this paper, we are concerned with how these tasks can be combined in a way that improves the performance of each of them. Inspired by Barrow and Tenenbaum, we present a flexible framework for interfacing scene analysis processes using intrinsic images. Each intrinsic image is a registered map describing one characteristic of the scene. We apply this framework to develop an integrated 3D scene understanding system with estimates of surface orientations, occlusion boundaries, objects, camera viewpoint, and relative depth. Our experiments on a set of 300 outdoor images demonstrate that these tasks reinforce each other, and we illustrate a coherent scene understanding with automatically reconstructed 3D models.", "citation": "Citations (186)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Derek Hoiem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoiem:Derek", "Alexei A.
