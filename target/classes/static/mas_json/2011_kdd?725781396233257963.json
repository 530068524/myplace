We employ a topic model to find topical aspects of each user and a retrieval method to identify influential users by combining the language model and the topic model. An influence maximization algorithm is then presented to find the sub network that closely connects the influential users. Two demonstration systems have been developed and are online available. Empirical analysis based on the user's viewing time and the number of clicks validates the proposed methodologies.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Jie", "Sen Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Sen", "Bo Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Bo", "Yang Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Yang"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
