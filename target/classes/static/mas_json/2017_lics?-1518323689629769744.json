While this problem is non-primitive recursive in general, we highlight a subclass of polynomial automata for which the Zeroness Problem is primitive recursive. Refining further, we identify a subclass of affine VAS for which coverability is in 2EXPSPACE. We also use polynomial automata to obtain new proofs that equivalence of streaming string transducers is decidable, and that equivalence of copyless streaming string transducers is in PSPACE.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Michael Benedikt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benedikt:Michael", "Timothy Duff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duff:Timothy", "Aditya Sharad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharad:Aditya", "James Worrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Worrell_0001:James"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
