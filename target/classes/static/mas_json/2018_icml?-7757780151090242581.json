{"title": "Estimation of Markov Chain via Rank-constrained Likelihood.", "fields": ["convex function", "divergence", "stochastic matrix", "maximization", "estimator"], "abstract": "This paper studies the recovery and state compression of low-rank Markov chains from empirical trajectories. We propose a non-convex estimator based on rank-constrained likelihood maximization. Statistical upper bounds are provided for the Kullback-Leiber divergence and the $\\ell_2$ risk between the estimator and the true transition matrix. The estimator reveals a compressed state space of the Markov chain. We also develop a novel DC (difference of convex function) programming algorithm to tackle the rank-constrained non-smooth optimization problem. Convergence results are established. Experiments with taxi trip data show that the estimator is able to identify the zoning of Manhattan city.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Xudong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xudong", "Mengdi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Mengdi", "Anru Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Anru"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
