{"title": "A spark of activity: exploring informative art as visualization for physical activity.", "fields": ["information seeking", "spark", "visualization", "data visualization", "graph"], "abstract": "In this note, we describe Spark, an informative art display that visualizes physical activity using abstract art. We present results from five deployments, lasting two to three weeks, that suggest that while graph visualizations are useful for information seeking, abstract visualizations are preferred for display purposes. Our results show that informative art is an appropriate way to visualize physical activity, and can be used in addition to graphs to increase enjoyment and engagement with physical activity displays.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Chloe Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Chloe", "Jodi Forlizzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forlizzi:Jodi", "Anind K.
