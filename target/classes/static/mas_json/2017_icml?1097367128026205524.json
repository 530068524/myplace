At the same time, our codec is designed to be lightweight and deployable: for example, it can encode or decode the Kodak dataset in around 10ms per image on GPU. \nOur architecture is an autoencoder featuring pyramidal analysis, an adaptive coding module, and regularization of the expected codelength. We also supplement our approach with adversarial training specialized towards use in a compression setting: this enables us to produce visually pleasing reconstructions for very low bitrates.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Facebook"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Oren Rippel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rippel:Oren", "Lubomir D.
