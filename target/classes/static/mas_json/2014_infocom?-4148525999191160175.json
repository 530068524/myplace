{"title": "When queueing meets coding: Optimal-latency data retrieving scheme in storage clouds.", "fields": ["queue", "latency", "forward error correction", "cloud storage", "thread"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of reducing the delay of downloading data from cloud storage systems by leveraging multiple parallel threads, assuming that the data has been encoded and stored in the clouds using fixed rate forward error correction (FEC) codes with parameters (n, k). That is, each file is divided into k equal-sized chunks, which are then expanded into n chunks such that any k chunks out of the n are sufficient to successfully restore the original file. The model can be depicted as a multiple-server queue with arrivals of data retrieving requests and a server corresponding to a thread. However, this is not a typical queueing model because a server can terminate its operation, depending on when other servers complete their service (due to the redundancy that is spread across the threads). Hence, to the best of our knowledge, the analysis of this queueing model remains quite uncharted. \nRecent traces from Amazon S3 show that the time to retrieve a fixed size chunk is random and can be approximated as a constant delay plus an i.i.d. exponentially distributed random variable. For the tractability of the theoretical analysis, we assume that the chunk downloading time is i.i.d. exponentially distributed. Under this assumption, we show that any work-conserving scheme is delay-optimal among all on-line scheduling schemes when k = 1. When k > 1, we find that a simple greedy scheme, which allocates all available threads to the head of line request, is delay optimal among all on-line scheduling schemes. We also provide some numerical results that point to the limitations of the exponential assumption, and suggest further research directions.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "NTT DoCoMo", "Tsinghua University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Shengbo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shengbo", "Yin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yin", "Ulas C.
