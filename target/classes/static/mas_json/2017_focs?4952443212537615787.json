In the absence of any restrictions on the input, the best known algorithm for k-means with a provable guarantee is a simple local search heuristic yielding an approximation guarantee of 9+\u2265ilon, a ratio that is known to be tight with respect to such methods.We overcome this barrier by presenting a new primal-dual approach that allows us to (1) exploit the geometric structure of k-means and (2) to satisfy the hard constraint that at most k clusters are selected without deteriorating the approximation guarantee. Our main result is a 6.357-approximation algorithm with respect to the standard LP relaxation. Our techniques are quite general and we also show improved guarantees for the general version of k-means where the underlying metric is not required to be Euclidean and for k-median in Euclidean metrics.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Sara Ahmadian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmadian:Sara", "Ashkan Norouzi-Fard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norouzi=Fard:Ashkan", "Ola Svensson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svensson:Ola", "Justin Ward.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Ward:Justin"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
