{"title": "Skill Characterization Based on Betweenness.", "fields": ["graph", "machine learning", "bottleneck", "betweenness centrality", "centrality"], "abstract": "We present a characterization of a useful class of skills based on a graphical representation of an agent's interaction with its environment. Our characterization uses betweenness, a measure of centrality on graphs. It captures and generalizes (at least intuitively) the bottleneck concept, which has inspired many of the existing skill-discovery algorithms. Our characterization may be used directly to form a set of skills suitable for a given task. More importantly, it serves as a useful guide for developing incremental skill-discovery algorithms that do not rely on knowing or representing the interaction graph in its entirety.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["\u00d6zg\u00fcr Simsek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simsek:=Ouml=zg=uuml=r", "Andrew G.
