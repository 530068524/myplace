To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel key-value memory-augmented attention model for NMT, called KVMEMATT. Specifically, we maintain a timely updated keymemory to keep track of attention history and a fixed value-memory to store the representation of source sentence throughout the whole translation process. Via nontrivial transformations and iterative interactions between the two memories, the decoder focuses on more appropriate source word(s) for predicting the next target word at each decoding step, therefore can improve the adequacy of translations. Experimental results on Chinese=>English and WMT17 German English translation tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tencent", "Tencent", "Tencent", "Tencent", "Tencent"], "authors": ["Fandong Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Fandong", "Zhaopeng Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Zhaopeng", "Yong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Yong", "Haiyang Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Haiyang", "Junjie Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Junjie", "Yuekui Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yuekui", "Di Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Di"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
