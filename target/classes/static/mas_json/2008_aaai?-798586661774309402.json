The idea is to use algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) for compactly representing the problem itself and all the relevant intermediate computation results in the algorithm. We leverage Symbolic Perseus for computing the lower bound of the optimal value function using ADD operators, and provide a novel ADD-based procedure for computing the upper bound. Experiments on a number of standard factored POMDP problems show that we can achieve an order of magnitude improvement in performance over previously proposed algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "HCI Research De ... , Seoul, Korea", "HCI Research De ... , Seoul, Korea"], "authors": ["Hyeong Seop Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Hyeong_Seop", "Kee-Eung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kee=Eung", "Jin Hyung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jin_Hyung", "Du-Seong Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Du=Seong", "Myoung-Wan Koo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koo:Myoung=Wan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
