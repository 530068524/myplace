In other words, the network will have traditional IP routers and SDN switches coexisting, and it is called a hybrid SDN network. With such a network, we take advantage of SDN and propose an approach to guarantee traffic reachability in the presence of any single link failure. By redirecting traffic on the failed link to SDN switches through pre-configured IP tunnels, the proposed approach is able to react to the failures very fast. With the help of coordination among SDN switches, we are also able to explore multiple backup paths for the failure recovery. This allows the proposed approach to avoid potential congestion in the post-recovery network by choosing proper backup paths. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme requires only a very few number of SDN switches in the hybrid SDN network to achieve fast recovery and guarantee 100% reachability from any single link failure. It also shows that the proposed approach is able to better load-balance the post-recovery network comparing to IP Fast Reroute and shortest path re-calculation.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["New York University", "AT&T Labs", "Huawei", "New York University"], "authors": ["Cing-yu Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Cing=yu", "Kang Xi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xi:Kang", "Min Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Min", "H.
