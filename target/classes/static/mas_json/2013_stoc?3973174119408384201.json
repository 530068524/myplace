Our improved approximation ratio is achieved by exploiting the power of pseudo-approximation. More specifically, our approach is based on two components, each of which, we believe, is of independent interest. First, we show that in order to give an $\\alpha$-approximation algorithm for $k$-median, it is sufficient to give a pseudo-approximation algorithm that finds an $\\alpha$-approximate solution by opening $k+O(1)$ facilities. This is a rather surprising result as there exist instances for which opening $k+1$ facilities may lead to a significantly smaller cost than that of opening only $k$ facilities. Second, we give such a pseudo-approximation algorithm with $\\alpha=1+\\sqrt{3}+\\epsilon$. Prior to our work, it was not even known whether opening $k+o(k)$ facilities would help improve the approximation ratio.", "citation": "Citations (148)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Princeton University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shi", "Ola Svensson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svensson:Ola"], "pages": 10}
