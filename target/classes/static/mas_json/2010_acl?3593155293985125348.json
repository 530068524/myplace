{"title": "Latent Variable Models of Selectional Preference.", "fields": ["latent variable model", "latent variable", "latent class model", "topic model", "latent dirichlet allocation"], "abstract": "This paper describes the application of so-called topic models to selectional preference induction. Three models related to Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a proven method for modelling document-word cooccurrences, are presented and evaluated on datasets of human plausibility judgements. Compared to previously proposed techniques, these models perform very competitively, especially for infrequent predicate-argument combinations where they exceed the quality of Web-scale predictions while using relatively little data.", "citation": "Citations (120)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Cambridge"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Diarmuid \u00d3 S\u00e9aghdha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=eacute=aghdha:Diarmuid_=Oacute="], "pages": 10}
