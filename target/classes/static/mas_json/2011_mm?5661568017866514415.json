However, BoF model lacks the spatial information of visual words, which is informative for local features to build up meaningful visual patches. To compensate for the spatial information loss, in this paper, we propose a novel query expansion method called Spatial Co-occurrence Query Expansion (SCQE), by utilizing the spatial co-occurrence information of visual words mined from the database images to boost the retrieval performance. In offline phase, for each visual word in the vocabulary, we treat the visual words that are frequently co-occurred with it in the database images as neighbors, base on which a spatial co-occurrence graph is built. In online phase, a query image can be expanded with some spatial co-occurred but unseen visual words according to the spatial co-occurrence graph, and the retrieval performance can be improved by expanding these visual words appropriately. Experimental results demonstrate that, SCQE achieves promising improvements over the typical BoF baseline on two datasets comprising 5K and 505K images respectively.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "National University of Singapore", "Peking University", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "authors": ["Yingfei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yingfei", "Bo Geng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geng:Bo", "Zheng-Jun Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Zheng=Jun", "Yangxi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yangxi", "Dacheng Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Dacheng", "Chao Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0006:Chao"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
