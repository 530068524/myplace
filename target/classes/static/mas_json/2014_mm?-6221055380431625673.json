By comparing a query vector to several of these intermediate representations, we screen the large values taken by the similarities between the query and all the vectors, at a fraction of the cost of exhaustive similarity calculation. Unlike concurrent indexing methods that suffer from the curse of dimensionality, our method exploits the properties of high-dimensional spaces. It therefore complements other strategies for approximate nearest neighbor search. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate the potential of group testing for searching large databases of multimedia objects represented by vectors. We obtain a large improvement in terms of the theoretical complexity, at the cost of a small or negligible decrease of accuracy.We hope that this preliminary work will pave the way to subsequent works for multimedia retrieval with limited resources.", "citation": "Citations (39)", "departments": ["Peking University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Miaojing Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Miaojing", "Teddy Furon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furon:Teddy", "Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=eacute=gou:Herv=eacute="], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
