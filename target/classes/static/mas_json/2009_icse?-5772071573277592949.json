{"title": "SmartTutor: Creating IDE-based interactive tutorials via editable replay.", "fields": ["systems engineering", "simulation", "development environment", "eclipse", "documentation"], "abstract": "Interactive tutorials, like Eclipse's cheat sheets, are good for novice programmers to learn how to perform tasks (e.g., checking out a CVS project) in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Creating these tutorials often requires programming effort that is time-consuming and difficult. In this paper, we propose an approach using editable replay of user actions to help authors create interactive tutorials with little programming effort. User actions of performing a task can be recorded, edited, and presented as a tutorial. The tutorial can be replayed interactively for mentoring. We present our SmartTutor implementation in the Eclipse IDE and conduct a preliminary evaluation on it, which demonstrates efficiency gains for the tutorial authors.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Ying Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0012:Ying", "Gang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Gang", "Nuyun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Nuyun", "Hong Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Hong"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
