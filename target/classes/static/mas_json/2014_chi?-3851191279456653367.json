{"title": "Designing for dabblers and deterring drop-outs in citizen science.", "fields": ["old weather", "citizen science", "human computer interaction", "computer science"], "abstract": "In most online citizen science projects, a large proportion of participants contribute in small quantities. To investigate how low contributors differ from committed volunteers, we distributed a survey to members of the Old Weather project, followed by interviews with respondents selected according to a range of contribution levels. The studies reveal a complex relationship between motivations and contribution. Whilst high contributors were deeply engaged by social or competitive features, low contributors described a solitary experience of 'dabbling' in projects for short periods. Since the majority of participants exhibit this small-scale contribution pattern, there is great potential value in designing interfaces to tempt lone workers to complete 'just another page', or to lure early drop-outs back into participation. This includes breaking the work into components which can be tackled without a major commitment of time and effort, and providing feedback on the quality and value of these contributions.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "Met Office", "University College London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alexandra Eveleigh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eveleigh:Alexandra", "Charlene Jennett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jennett:Charlene", "Ann Blandford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blandford:Ann", "Philip Brohan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brohan:Philip", "Anna Louise Cox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cox:Anna_Louise"], "pages": 10}
