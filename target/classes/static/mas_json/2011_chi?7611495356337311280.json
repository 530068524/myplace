Facet-Streams combines techniques of information visualization with tangible and multi-touch interaction to materialize collaborative search on a tabletop. It harnesses the expressive power of facets and Boolean logic without exposing users to complex formal notations. Two user studies reveal how Facet-Streams unifies visual and tangible expressivity with simplicity in interaction, supports different strategies and collaboration styles, and turns product search into a fun and social experience.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Hans-Christian Jetter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jetter:Hans=Christian", "Jens Gerken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerken:Jens", "Michael Z\u00f6llner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Z=ouml=llner:Michael", "Harald Reiterer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reiterer:Harald", "Natasa Milic-Frayling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milic=Frayling:Natasa"], "pages": 10}
