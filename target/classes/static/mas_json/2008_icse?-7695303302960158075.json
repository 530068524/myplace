Unfortunately, the rationale for these decisions is usually not captured and is therefore lost. The Software Using RATionale (SEURAT) system integrates with the Eclipse Interactive Development Environment to support rationale capture and use. In addition to presenting the rationale to the developer/maintainer as needed, SEURAT also supports requirements traceability and impact assessment.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Miami University", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"], "authors": ["Janet E.
