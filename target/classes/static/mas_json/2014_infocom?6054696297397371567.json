{"title": "Shake and walk: Acoustic direction finding and fine-grained indoor localization using smartphones.", "fields": ["millimeter", "direction finding", "inertial measurement unit", "horizontal plane", "shake"], "abstract": "We propose an accurate acoustic direction finding scheme, Swadloon, according to the arbitrary pattern of phone shaking in rough horizontal plane. Swadloon tracks the displace- ment of smartphone relative to the acoustic direction with the resolution less than 1 millimeter. The direction is then obtained by combining the velocity from the displacement with the one from the inertial sensors. Major challenges in implementing Swadloon are to measure the displacement precisely and to estimate the shaking velocity accurately when the speed of phone-shaking is low and changes arbitrarily. We propose rigorous methods to address these challenges, and apply Swadloon to several case studies: Phone-to-Phone direction finding, indoor localization and tracking. Our extensive experiments show that the mean error of direction finding is around 2:1 o within the range of 32m. For indoor localization, the 90-percentile errors are under 0:92m. For real-time tracking, the errors are within 0:4m for walks of 51m.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Tsinghua University", "Jiangnan University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Wenchao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Wenchao", "Yan Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Yan", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Hao Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Hao", "XuFei Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:XuFei", "Panlong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Panlong", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
