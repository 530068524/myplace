{"title": "Shark: fast data analysis using coarse-grained distributed memory.", "fields": ["distributed memory", "data warehouse", "data manipulation language", "distributed shared memory", "sql"], "abstract": "Shark is a research data analysis system built on a novel coarse-grained distributed shared-memory abstraction. Shark marries query processing with deep data analysis, providing a unified system for easy data manipulation using SQL and pushing sophisticated analysis closer to data. It scales to thousands of nodes in a fault-tolerant manner. Shark can answer queries 40X faster than Apache Hive and run machine learning programs 25X faster than MapReduce programs in Apache Hadoop on large datasets.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Cliff Engle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Engle:Cliff", "Antonio Lupher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lupher:Antonio", "Reynold Xin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xin:Reynold", "Matei Zaharia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaharia:Matei", "Michael J.
