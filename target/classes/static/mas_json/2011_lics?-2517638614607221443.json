While no known Cartesian-closed category is stable under the latter, we show that the so-called thin (uniform) CRVs define a strong monad on the Cartesian-closed category of bc-domains. We also characterize their inequational theory, as (fair-)coin algebras. We apply this to solve a recent problem posed by M. Escardo: testing is semi-decidable for EPCF terms. CRVs arose from the study of the second author's (layered) Hoare indexed valuations, and we also make the connection apparent.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "University of Rhode Island", "Purdue University", "Michigan State University", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Programmes et S ... , Paris, France"], "authors": ["Jean Goubault-Larrecq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goubault=Larrecq:Jean", "Daniele Varacca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varacca:Daniele"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
