In particular, we introduce the notion of a hierarchical route distribution and show how they can be leveraged to construct tractable PSDDs over route distributions, allowing them to scale to larger maps. We illustrate the utility of our model empirically, in a route prediction task, showing how accuracy can be increased significantly compared to Markov models.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Arthur Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Arthur", "Yujia Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yujia", "Adnan Darwiche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darwiche:Adnan"], "pages": 9}
