We consider three different PRFs: the Naor-Reingold PRF, a PRF based on the Legendre symbol, and a specialized block cipher design called MiMC. We present protocols for implementing these PRFs within a secret-sharing based MPC system, and discuss possible applications. We then compare the performance of our protocols. Depending on the application, different PRFs may offer different optimizations and advantages over the classic AES benchmark. Thus, we cannot conclude that there is one optimal PRF to be used in all situations.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Lorenzo Grassi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grassi_0001:Lorenzo", "Christian Rechberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rechberger:Christian", "Dragos Rotaru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rotaru:Dragos", "Peter Scholl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scholl:Peter", "Nigel P.
