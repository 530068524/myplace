{"title": "Predicting the future behavior of a time-varying probability distribution.", "fields": ["probability distribution", "extrapolation", "probabilistic logic", "pattern recognition", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We study the problem of predicting the future, though only in the probabilistic sense of estimating a future state of a time-varying probability distribution. This is not only an interesting academic problem, but solving this extrapolation problem also has many practical application, e.g. for training classifiers that have to operate under time-varying conditions.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Christoph H.
