Our proposed training algorithm, BoostResNet, is particularly suitable in non-differentiable architectures. Our method only requires the relatively inexpensive sequential training of T \"shallow ResNets\". We prove that the training error decays exponentially with the depth T if the weak module classifiers that we train perform slightly better than some weak baseline. In other words, we propose a weak learning condition and prove a boosting theory for ResNet under the weak learning condition. A generalization error bound based on margin theory is proved and suggests that ResNet could be resistant to overfitting using a network with l_1 norm bounded weights.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Princeton University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Furong Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Furong", "Jordan T.
