{"title": "Fixed-Rank Approximation of a Positive-Semidefinite Matrix from Streaming Data.", "fields": ["nystrom method", "sketch", "semidefinite programming", "positive definite matrix", "truncation"], "abstract": "Several important applications, such as streaming PCA and semidefinite programming, involve a large-scale positive-semidefinite (psd) matrix that is presented as a sequence of linear updates. Because of storage limitations, it may only be possible to retain a sketch of the psd matrix. This paper develops a new algorithm for fixed-rank psd approximation from a sketch. The approach combines the Nystrom approximation with a novel mechanism for rank truncation. Theoretical analysis establishes that the proposed method can achieve any prescribed relative error in the Schatten 1-norm and that it exploits the spectral decay of the input matrix. Computer experiments show that the proposed method dominates alternative techniques for fixed-rank psd matrix approximation across a wide range of examples.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Cornell University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Joel A.
