However, most existing hashing methods did not consider the hierarchical relation of labels, which means that they ignored the rich information stored in the hierarchy. Moreover, most of previous works treat each bit in a hash code equally, which does not meet the scenario of hierarchical labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing method, called supervised hierarchical deep hashing (SHDH), to perform hash code learning for hierarchical labeled data. Specifically, we define a novel similarity formula for hierarchical labeled data by weighting each layer, and design a deep convolutional neural network to obtain a hash code for each data point. Extensive experiments on several real-world public datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the image retrieval task.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "Capital Normal University", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "South China University of Technology"], "authors": ["Dan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Dan", "Heyan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Heyan", "Chi Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Chi", "Bo-Si Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Bo=Si", "Guihua Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Guihua", "Liqiang Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Liqiang", "Xianling Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Xianling"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
