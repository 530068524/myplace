{"title": "A high-quality low-delay remote rendering system for 3D video.", "fields": ["texture memory", "video post processing", "alternate frame rendering", "software rendering", "tiled rendering"], "abstract": "As an emerging technology, 3D video has shown a great potential to become the next generation media for tele-immersion. However, streaming and rendering this dynamic 3D data in real-time requires tremendous network bandwidth and computing resources. In this paper, we build a remote rendering model to better study different remote rendering designs and define 3D video rendering as an optimization problem. Moreover, we design a 3D video remote rendering system that significantly reduces the delay while maintaining high rendering quality. We also propose a reference viewpoint prediction algorithm with super sampling support that requires much less computation resources but provides better performance than the search-based algorithms proposed in the related work.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Shu Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Shu", "Mahsa Kamali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamali:Mahsa", "Klara Nahrstedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nahrstedt:Klara", "John C.
