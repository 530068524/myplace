Since cloud providers may not be trusted, a crucial problem is the verification of the integrity and correctness of such computation, possibly in a public way, i.e., the result of a computation can be verified by any third party, and requires no secret key -- akin to a digital signature on a message. We present new protocols for publicly verifiable secure outsourcing of Evaluation of High Degree Polynomials and Matrix Multiplication. Compared to previously proposed solutions, ours improve in efficiency and offer security in a stronger model. The paper also discusses several practical applications of our protocols.", "citation": "Citations (177)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["New York University", "City College of New York"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Dario Fiore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiore:Dario", "Rosario Gennaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gennaro:Rosario"], "pages": 12}
