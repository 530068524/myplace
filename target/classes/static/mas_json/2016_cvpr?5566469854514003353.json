To mitigate this issue, contemporary classification methods based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) typically follow classic strategies such as class re-sampling or cost-sensitive training. In this paper, we conduct extensive and systematic experiments to validate the effectiveness of these classic schemes for representation learning on class-imbalanced data. We further demonstrate that more discriminative deep representation can be learned by enforcing a deep network to maintain both intercluster and inter-class margins. This tighter constraint effectively reduces the class imbalance inherent in the local data neighborhood. We show that the margins can be easily deployed in standard deep learning framework through quintuplet instance sampling and the associated triple-header hinge loss. The representation learned by our approach, when combined with a simple k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm, shows significant improvements over existing methods on both high-and low-level vision classification tasks that exhibit imbalanced class distribution.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Shenzhen Inst.  ...
