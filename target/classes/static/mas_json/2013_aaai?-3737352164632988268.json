In this work, we show that multiple-instance learning admits a different form of resampling, which we call \"shuffling.\" In shuffling, we resample instances in such a way that the resulting bags are likely to be correctly labeled. We show that resampling results in both a reduction of bag label noise and a propagation of additional informative constraints to a multiple-instance classifier. We empirically evaluate shuffling in the context of multiple-instance classification and multiple-instance active learning and show that the approach leads to significant improvements in accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Case Western Reserve University", "Case Western Reserve University"], "authors": ["Gary Doran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doran:Gary", "Soumya Ray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ray:Soumya"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
