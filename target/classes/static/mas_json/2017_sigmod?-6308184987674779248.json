{"title": "Incremental View Maintenance over Array Data.", "fields": ["heuristic", "real time computing", "development environment", "integer programming", "data mining"], "abstract": "Science applications are producing an ever-increasing volume of multi-dimensional data that are mainly processed with distributed array databases. These raw arrays are ``cooked'' into derived data products using complex pipelines that are time-consuming. As a result, derived data products are released infrequently and become stale soon thereafter. In this paper, we introduce materialized array views as a database construct for scientific data products. We model the ``cooking'' process as incremental view maintenance with batch updates and give a three-stage heuristic that finds effective update plans. Moreover, the heuristic repartitions the array and the view continuously based on a window of past updates as a side-effect of view maintenance without overhead. We design an analytical cost model for integrating materialized array views in queries. A thorough experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed techniques are able to incrementally maintain a real astronomical data product in a production environment.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Merced", "University of California, Merced", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Weijie Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Weijie", "Florin Rusu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rusu:Florin", "Bin Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Bin", "Kesheng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Kesheng", "Peter Nugent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nugent:Peter"], "pages": 16}
