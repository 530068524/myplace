This paper presents detailed studies on the Nystrom sampling scheme and in particular, an error analysis that directly relates the Nystrom approximation quality with the encoding powers of the landmark points in summarizing the data. The resultant error bound suggests a simple and efficient sampling scheme, the  k -means clustering algorithm, for Nystrom low-rank approximation. We compare it with state-of-the-art approaches that range from greedy schemes to probabilistic sampling. Our algorithm achieves significant performance gains in a number of supervised/unsupervised learning tasks including kernel PCA and least squares SVM.", "citation": "Citations (283)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Kai Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Kai", "Ivor W.
