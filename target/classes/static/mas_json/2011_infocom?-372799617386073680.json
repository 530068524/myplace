The gathering efficiency refers to the ratio of the number of the sensors whose data have been gathered to the total number of sensors. Specifically, we design two efficient aggregation schemes, called single-hop-length (SHL) scheme and multiple-hop-length (MHL) scheme. By novelly integrating these two schemes, we theoretically prove that our protocol achieves the optimal tradeoffs, and derive the optimal aggregation throughput depending on a given threshold value (lower bound) on gathering efficiency. Particularly, we show that under the MHL scheme, for a practically important set of symmetric functions called divisible perfectly compressible (DPC) functions, including the mean, max, and various kinds of indicator functions, etc., the data from \\Theta (n) sensors can be aggregated to the sink at the throughput of a constant order \\Theta (1), implying that, our MHL scheme is indeed scalable.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Tongji University", "Tongji University", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "University of Chicago", "Tongji University", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Tongji University"], "authors": ["Cheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Cheng", "Shaojie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shaojie", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Changjun Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Changjun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
