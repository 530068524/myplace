AssocExplorer is designed by following the visual information-seeking mantra: overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand. It effectively uses coloring to deliver information so that users can easily detect things that are interesting to them. If users find a rule interesting, they can explore related rules for further analysis, which allows users to find interesting phenomenon that are difficult to detect when rules are examined separately. Our system also allows users to compare rules and inspect rules with similar item composition but different statistics so that the key factors that contribute to the difference can be isolated.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Institute for I ... pore, Singapore", "Institute for I ... pore, Singapore"], "authors": ["Guimei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Guimei", "Andre Suchitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suchitra:Andre", "Haojun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haojun", "Mengling Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Mengling", "See-Kiong Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:See=Kiong", "Limsoon Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Limsoon"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
