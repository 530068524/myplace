{"title": "Binary to Bushy: Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering with the Beta Coalescent.", "fields": ["hierarchical clustering", "binary tree", "coalescent theory", "dirichlet process", "belief propagation"], "abstract": "Discovering hierarchical regularities in data is a key problem in interacting with large datasets, modeling cognition, and encoding knowledge. A previous Bayesian solution\u2014Kingman's coalescent\u2014provides a probabilistic model for data represented as a binary tree. Unfortunately, this is inappropriate for data better described by bushier trees. We generalize an existing belief propagation framework of Kingman's coalescent to the beta coalescent, which models a wider range of tree structures. Because of the complex combinatorial search over possible structures, we develop new sampling schemes using sequential Monte Carlo and Dirichlet process mixture models, which render inference efficient and tractable. We present results on synthetic and real data that show the beta coalescent outperforms Kingman's coalescent and is qualitatively better at capturing data in bushy hierarchies.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Agricultural Research Service"], "authors": ["Yuening Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yuening", "Jordan L.
