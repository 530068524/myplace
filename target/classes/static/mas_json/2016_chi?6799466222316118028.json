We seek to broaden an understanding of how to manage interruptions by using the Locales Framework to analyze data collected from a field study on mobile notification interruptions in the ICU. Based on our data along with previous literature on cognitive theories, mental models, strategies for managing interruptions, and principles of human factors, we propose five guidelines to aid in designing mobile technology interventions for the ICU.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "Indiana University", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Preethi Srinivas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivas:Preethi", "Anthony Faiola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faiola:Anthony", "Gloria Mark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mark:Gloria"], "pages": 7}
