{"title": "A Simple and Practical Algorithm for Differentially Private Data Release.", "fields": ["data set", "multiplicative function", "contingency table", "data structure", "exponential function"], "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for differentially private data release, based on a simple combination of the Multiplicative Weights update rule with the Exponential Mechanism. Our MWEM algorithm achieves what are the best known and nearly optimal theoretical guarantees, while at the same time being simple to implement and experimentally more accurate on actual data sets than existing techniques.", "citation": "Citations (217)", "departments": ["IBM", "Cornell University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Moritz Hardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardt:Moritz", "Katrina Ligett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ligett:Katrina", "Frank McSherry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McSherry:Frank"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
