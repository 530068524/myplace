{"title": "WAPTEC: whitebox analysis of web applications for parameter tampering exploit construction.", "fields": ["exploit", "internet privacy", "replicate", "program analysis", "web application"], "abstract": "Parameter tampering attacks are dangerous to a web application whose server fails to replicate the validation of user-supplied data that is performed by the client. Malicious users who circumvent the client can capitalize on the missing server validation. In this paper, we describe WAPTEC, a tool that is designed to automatically identify parameter tampering vulnerabilities and generate exploits by construction to demonstrate those vulnerabilities. WAPTEC involves a new approach to whitebox analysis of the server's code. We tested WAPTEC on six open source applications and found previously unknown vulnerabilities in every single one of them.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Prithvi Bisht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bisht:Prithvi", "Timothy L.
