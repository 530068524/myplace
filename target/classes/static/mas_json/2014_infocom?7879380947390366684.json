We focus on detecting anomalies which, despite their significant impact on the routing system, remain concealed from state of the art tools. We design a machine learning system to winnow the prefixes with unintended limited visibility \u2013 symptomatic of anomalous events \u2013 from the prefixes with intended limited visibility \u2013 resulting from legitimate routing operations.\nWe train a winnowing algorithm with ground-truth data on 20,000 operational limited visibility prefixes (LVPs) already classified by the operators of the origin networks. The ground-truth was collected using the BGP Visibility Scanner, a tool we developed to provide operators with a multi-angle view on the efficacy of their routing policies. We build a dataset with the pre-classified prefixes\nand the features describing their visibility status dynamics. We further use this dataset to derive a boosted decision tree which winnows unintended LVPs with an accuracy of 95%.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["IMDEA Networks", "Carlos III Health Institute", "Carlos III Health Institute", "Loughborough University"], "authors": ["Andra Lutu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutu:Andra", "Marcelo Bagnulo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagnulo:Marcelo", "Jes\u00fas Cid-Sueiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cid=Sueiro:Jes=uacute=s", "Olaf Maennel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maennel:Olaf"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
