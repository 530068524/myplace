These sites of cooperative production have attracted tens of thousands and millions of contributors respectively, yet they embrace content standards, social norms, and models of editorial control that differ radically from the well-studied exemplar of Wikipedia. In this study, we investigated how Ancestry.com and Findagrave.com support production of historical resources through analysis of message boards and interviews with participants. We found that these sites are not only places for building a historical resource, but simultaneously serve as opportunities for public memorialization and familial identity construction. Notably, we found that contributors to these websites embrace the idea of familial oversight of biographical information in order to maintain high standards of quality, and they harbor a corresponding skepticism of the open editing practices that have become a hallmark of many open collaboration projects.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "authors": ["Heather Willever-Farr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willever=Farr:Heather", "Andrea Forte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forte:Andrea"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
