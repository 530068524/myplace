We propose a practical algorithm which uses random projection to achieve greedy forwarding on a space of dimension O(log(n)) where nodes have coordinates of size O(log(n)), thus achieving greedy forwarding using a route table at each node of polylogarithmic size with respect to the number of nodes. We further improve this algorithm by using a quasi-greedy algorithm which ensures greedy forwarding works along a path-wise construction, al- lowing us to further reduce the dimension of the embedding. The proposed algorithm, denoted GLoVE-U, is fully distributed and practical to implement. We evaluate the performance using extensive simulations and show that our greedy forwarding algorithm delivers low path stretch and scales properly.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo"], "authors": ["C\u00e9dric Westphal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Westphal:C=eacute=dric", "Guanhong Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Guanhong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
