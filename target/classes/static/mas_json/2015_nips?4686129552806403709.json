In this paper we develop a loss function for multi-label learning, based on the Wasserstein distance. The Wasserstein distance provides a natural notion of dissimilarity for probability measures. Although optimizing with respect to the exact Wasserstein distance is costly, recent work has described a regularized approximation that is efficiently computed. We describe an efficient learning algorithm based on this regularization, as well as a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance from probability measures to unnormalized measures. We also describe a statistical learning bound for the loss. The Wasserstein loss can encourage smoothness of the predictions with respect to a chosen metric on the output space. We demonstrate this property on a real-data tag prediction problem, using the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons dataset, outperforming a baseline that doesn't use the metric.", "citation": "Citations (101)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Royal Dutch Shell", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Charlie Frogner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frogner:Charlie", "Chiyuan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chiyuan", "Hossein Mobahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mobahi:Hossein", "Mauricio Araya-Polo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Araya=Polo:Mauricio", "Tomaso A.
