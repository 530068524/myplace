It aims at locating semantic regions in images for further image understanding. In this paper, we address the issue of motion saliency detection for video content analysis. Inspired by the idea of Spectral Residual for image saliency detection, we propose a new method Temporal Spectral Residual on video slices along X-T and Y-T planes, which can automatically separate foreground motion objects from backgrounds, also with the help of threshold selection and voting schemes. Different from conventional background modeling methods with complex mathematical model, the proposed method is only based on Fourier spectrum analysis, so it is simple and fast. The power of our proposed method is demonstrated in the experiments of four typical videos with different dynamic background.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Xinyi Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Xinyi", "Qingshan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Qingshan", "Dimitris N.
