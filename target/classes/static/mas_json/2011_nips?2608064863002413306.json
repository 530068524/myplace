Despite compelling proof of concept systems, barriers to clinical translation remain. One challenge is to develop a low-power, fully-implantable system that dissipates only minimal power so as not to damage tissue. To this end, we implemented a Kalman-filter based decoder via a spiking neural network (SNN) and tested it in brain-machine interface (BMI) experiments with a rhesus monkey. The Kalman filter was trained to predict the arm's velocity and mapped on to the SNN using the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF). A 2,000-neuron embedded Matlab SNN implementation runs in real-time and its closed-loop performance is quite comparable to that of the standard Kalman filter. The success of this closed-loop decoder holds promise for hardware SNN implementations of statistical signal processing algorithms on neuromorphic chips, which may offer power savings necessary to overcome a major obstacle to the successful clinical translation of neural motor prostheses.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Li\u00e8ge", "Stanford University", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Julie Dethier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dethier:Julie", "Paul Nuyujukian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nuyujukian:Paul", "Chris Eliasmith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eliasmith:Chris", "Terrence C.
