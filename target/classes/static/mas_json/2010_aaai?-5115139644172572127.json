{"title": "Bypassing Combinatorial Protections: Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Single-Peaked Electorates.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "partition", "machine learning", "discrete mathematics", "social choice theory", "time complexity", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "For many election systems, bribery (and related) attacks have been shown NP-hard using constructions on combinatorially rich structures such as partitions and covers. This paper shows that for voters who follow the most central political-science model of electorates-- single-peaked preferences--those hardness protections vanish. By using single-peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial covering challenges, we for the first time show that NP-hard bribery problems--including those for Kemeny and Llull elections--fall to polynomial time for single-peaked electorates. By using single-peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial partition challenges, we for the first time show that NP-hard partition-of-voters problems fall to polynomial time for single-peaked electorates. We show that for single-peaked electorates, the winner problems for Dodgson and Kemeny elections, though \u03982p-complete in the general case, fall to polynomial time. And we completely classify the complexity of weighted coalition manipulation for scoring protocols in single-peaked electorates.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Duke University", "Rochester Institute of Technology", "University of Rochester", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Rochester Institute of Technology", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Felix Brandt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brandt_0001:Felix", "Markus Brill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brill:Markus", "Edith Hemaspaandra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hemaspaandra:Edith", "Lane A.
