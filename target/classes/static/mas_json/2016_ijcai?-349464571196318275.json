{"title": "Complexity of Efficient and Envy-Free Resource Allocation: Few Agents, Resources, or Utility Levels.", "fields": ["computational complexity theory", "discrete mathematics", "envy free", "monotonic function", "resource allocation"], "abstract": "We study the problem of finding a Pareto-efficient and envy-free allocation of a set of indivisible resources to a set of agents with monotonic preferences, either dichotomous or additive. Motivated by results of Bouveret and Lang [JAIR 2008], we provide a refined computational complexity analysis by studying the influence of three natural parameters: the number n of agents, the number m of resources, and the number z of different numbers occurring in utility-based preferences of the agents. On the negative side, we show that small values for n and z alone do not significantly lower the computational complexity in most cases. On the positive side, devising fixed-parameter algorithms we show that all considered problems are tractable in case of small m. Furthermore, we develop a fixed-parameter algorithm indicating that the problem with additive preferences becomes computationally tractable in case of small n and small z.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Bernhard Bliem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bliem:Bernhard", "Robert Bredereck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bredereck:Robert", "Rolf Niedermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niedermeier:Rolf"], "pages": 7}
