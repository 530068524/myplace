{"title": "Evaluating compliance-without-pressure techniques for increasing participation in online communities.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "knowledge management", "online participation", "multimedia", "online community"], "abstract": "Social psychology offers several theories of potential use for designing techniques to increase user contributions to online communities. Some of these techniques follow the \"compliance without pressure\" approach, where users are led to comply with a request without being subjected to any obvious external pressure. We evaluated two such techniques -- foot-in-the-door and low-ball -- in the context of Cyclopath, a geographic wiki. We found that while both techniques succeeded, low-ball elicited more work than foot-in-the-door. We discuss design and research implications of applying these (and other such techniques) in online communities.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Mikhil Masli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masli:Mikhil", "Loren G.
