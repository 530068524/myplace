In this paper we aim at formalizing the approach to learning with monotonicity constraints from statistical point of view. Motivated by the statistical analysis, we present an algorithm for learning rule ensembles. The algorithm first \"monotonizes\" the data using a nonparametric classification procedure and then generates a rule ensemble consistent with the training set. The procedure is justified by a theoretical analysis and verified in a computational experiment.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Pozna\u0144 University of Technology", "Pozna\u0144 University of Technology"], "authors": ["Wojciech Kotlowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotlowski:Wojciech", "Roman Slowinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slowinski:Roman"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
