However, defining exactly which challenges are important and which aspects of gaming experience are affected is largely under-explored. In this paper, we investigate if altering the level of challenge in a videogame influences people's experience of immersion. Our first study demonstrates that simply increasing the physical demands of the game by requiring gamers to interact more with the game does not result in increased immersion. In a further two studies, we use time pressure to make games more physically  and  cognitively challenging. We find that the addition of time pressure increases immersion as predicted. We argue that the level of challenge experienced is an interaction between the level of expertise of the gamer and the cognitive challenge encompassed within the game.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University College London", "University of York", "University College London", "University of York"], "authors": ["Anna Louise Cox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cox:Anna_Louise", "Paul A.
