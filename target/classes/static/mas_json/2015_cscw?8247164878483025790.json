{"title": "Authenticity, Relatability and Collaborative Approaches to Sharing Knowledge about Assistive Living Technology.", "fields": ["ageing", "co design", "knowledge sharing", "human computer interaction", "online health communities"], "abstract": "Health and care providers are increasingly looking to online and peer-to-peer services to supplement existing channels of assistive living technology (ALTs) provision and assessment. We describe the findings from 12 co-design workshops with 28 people from the UK representing a range of older people with and without health conditions, users of ALT and carers for people using such devices. The workshops were conducted to explore issues related to finding reliable information about ALT with the goal of gathering requirements for the design of a peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform. Our analysis highlights how a current reliance on peers and informal networks relates to a desire to establish the authenticity and relatability of another person's experience to one's own circumstances. This connects to a perceived mistrust in information where provenance and authenticity is not clear. We use these to critique the wisdom of taking an e-marketplace and recommendation service approach to ALT provision and assessment, and offer alternatives based on our findings.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Years Ahead Par ...
