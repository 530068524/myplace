But analyzing the plethora of relationships derived by the framework is challenging. In this demo, we show how visualization can help in the discovery of relationships that are potentially interesting by allowing users to query and explore the relationship set in an intuitive way. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of the visual interface through case studies, and demo visitors will also interact with the polygamous relationships.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yeukyin Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Yeukyin", "Fernando Chirigati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chirigati:Fernando", "Harish Doraiswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doraiswamy:Harish", "Cl\u00e1udio T.
