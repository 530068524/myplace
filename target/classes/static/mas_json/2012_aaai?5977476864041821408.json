{"title": "An Efficient Higher-Order Consistency Algorithm for Table Constraints.", "fields": ["local consistency", "mathematical optimization", "constraint programming", "computer science", "algorithm"], "abstract": "Table constraints are very important in constraint programming as they are present in many real problems from areas such as configuration and databases. As a result, numerous specialized algorithms that achieve generalized arc consistency (GAC) on table constraints have been proposed. Since these algorithms achieve GAC, they operate on one constraint at a time. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for table constraints that achieves a stronger local consistency than GAC. This algorithm, called maxRPWC+, is based on the local consistency maxRPWC and allows the efficient handling of intersecting table constraints. Experimental results from benchmark problems demonstrate that maxRPWC+ is clearly more robust than a state-of-the-art GAC algorithm in classes of problems with interleaved table constraints, being orders of magnitude faster in some of these classes.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Western Macedonia", "University of Western Macedonia"], "authors": ["Anastasia Paparrizou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paparrizou:Anastasia", "Kostas Stergiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stergiou:Kostas"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
