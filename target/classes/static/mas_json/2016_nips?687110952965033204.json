Rather than plugging a consistent density estimate (which requires k \u2192 \u221e as the sample size n \u2192 \u221e) into the functional of interest, the estimators we consider fix k and perform a bias correction. This can be more efficient computationally, and, as we show, statistically, leading to faster convergence rates. Our framework unifies several previous estimators, for most of which ours are the first finite sample guarantees.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Shashank Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh_0005:Shashank", "Barnab\u00e1s P\u00f3czos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=oacute=czos:Barnab=aacute=s"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
