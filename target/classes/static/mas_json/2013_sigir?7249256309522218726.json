This paper presents two document ranking models that combine both approaches by explicitly modeling word-pairs. The first model, called PairModel, is a monolingual ranking model based on word pairs that are derived from click-through data. It maps queries and documents into a concept space spanned by these word pairs. The second model, called Bilingual Paired Topic Model (BPTM), uses bilingual word pairs and jointly models a bilingual query-document collection. This model maps queries and documents in multiple languages into a lower dimensional semantic subspace. Experimental results on web search task show that they significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baseline models, and the best result is obtained by interpolating PairModel and BPTM.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Microsoft", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jagarlamudi:Jagadeesh", "Jianfeng Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jianfeng"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
