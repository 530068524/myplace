Scythe is designed to help end-users program SQL and explore data simply using input-output examples. From a web-browser, users can obtain SQL queries with Scythe in an automated, interactive fashion: from a provided example, Scythe synthesizes SQL queries and resolves ambiguities via conversations with the users.   In this demo, we first show Scythe how end users can formulate queries using Scythe; we then switch to the perspective of an algorithm designer to show how Scythe can scale up to handle complex SQL features, like outer joins and subqueries.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Chenglong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chenglong", "Alvin Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Alvin", "Rastislav Bod\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bod=iacute=k:Rastislav"], "pages": 4}
