For parameter 0 < \u03b1 < 1, we consider the notion of an \u03b1-maximal clique in an uncertain graph. We present matching upper and lower bounds on the number of \u03b1-maximal cliques possible within a (uncertain) graph. We present an algorithm to enumerate \u03b1-maximal cliques whose worst-case runtime is near-optimal, and an experimental evaluation showing the practical utility of the algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Arko Provo Mukherjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukherjee:Arko_Provo", "Pan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Pan", "Srikanta Tirthapura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tirthapura:Srikanta"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
