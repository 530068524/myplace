{"title": "Eliminative induction: a basis for arguing system confidence.", "fields": ["confidence interval", "argument", "reliability engineering", "computer science"], "abstract": "Assurance cases provide a structured method of explaining why a system has some desired property, e.g., that the system is safe. But there is no agreed approach for explaining what degree of confidence one should have in the conclusions of such a case. In this paper, we use the principle of eliminative induction to provide a justified basis for assessing how much confidence one should have in an assurance case argument.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Software Engineering Institute", "Software Engineering Institute", "Software Engineering Institute"], "authors": ["John B.
