Today, cloud computing offers different service models as a base for successful end user applications. In this paper we propose joining peer-to-peer and cloud computing into new architectural realization of a distributed cloud computing network for multimedia streaming, in a both centralized and peer-to-peer distributed manner. This architecture merges private and public clouds and it is intended for a commercial use, but in the same time scalable to offer the possibility of non-profitable use. In order to take advantage of the cloud paradigm and make multimedia streaming more efficient, we introduce APIs in the cloud, containing build-in functions for automatic QoS calculation, which permits negotiating QoS parameters such as bandwidth, jitter and latency, among a cloud service provider and its potential clients.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "departments": ["ETSIT UPM Spain, Madrid, Spain", "ETSIT UPM Spain, Madrid, Spain", "EUI UPM Spain, Madrid, Spain"], "authors": ["Irena Trajkovska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trajkovska:Irena", "Joaquin Salvachua Rodriguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodriguez:Joaquin_Salvachua", "Alberto Mozo Velasco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Velasco:Alberto_Mozo"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
