{"title": "Adaptive Maximization of Pointwise Submodular Functions With Budget Constraint.", "fields": ["adaptive optimization", "greedy randomized adaptive search procedure", "pointwise", "maximization", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "We study the worst-case adaptive optimization problem with budget constraint that is useful for modeling various practical applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning. We investigate the near-optimality of greedy algorithms for this problem with both modular and non-modular cost functions. In both cases, we prove that two simple greedy algorithms are not near-optimal but the best between them is near-optimal if the utility function satisfies pointwise submodularity and pointwise cost-sensitive submodularity respectively. This implies a combined algorithm that is near-optimal with respect to the optimal algorithm that uses half of the budget. We discuss applications of our theoretical results and also report experiments comparing the greedy algorithms on the active learning problem.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Nguyen Cuong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cuong:Nguyen", "Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
