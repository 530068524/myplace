We show that the dimension of the ambient space is crucial for separability, and that low dimensions chosen in prior work are not optimal. We suggest lower and upper bounds together with a data-driven procedure for choosing the optimal ambient dimension. Application of our approach to the Hopkins155 video benchmark database uniformly outperforms a range of state-of-the-art methods both in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational speed.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Fabien Lauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lauer:Fabien", "Christoph Schn\u00f6rr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schn=ouml=rr:Christoph"], "pages": 8}
