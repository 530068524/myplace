{"title": "Robust tracking via weakly supervised ranking SVM.", "fields": ["fold", "visual appearance", "active appearance model", "ranking svm", "ranking"], "abstract": "Appearance model is a key component of tracking algorithms. Most existing approaches utilize the object information contained in the current and previous frames to construct the object appearance model and locate the object with the model in frame t + 1. This method may work well if the object appearance just fluctuates in short time intervals. Nevertheless, suboptimal locations will be generated in frame t + 1 if the visual appearance changes substantially from the model. Then, continuous changes would accumulate errors and finally result in a tracking failure. To copy with this problem, in this paper we propose a novel algorithm \u2014 online Laplacian ranking support vector tracker (LRSVT) \u2014 to robustly locate the object. The LRSVT incorporates the labeled information of the object in the initial and the latest frames to resist the occlusion and adapt to the fluctuation of the visual appearance, and the weakly labeled information from frame t + 1 to adapt to substantial changes of the appearance. Extensive experiments on public benchmark sequences show the superior performance of LRSVT over some state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yancheng Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Yancheng", "Ming Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Ming"], "pages": 8}
