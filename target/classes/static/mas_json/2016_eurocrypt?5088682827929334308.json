{"title": "Cryptanalysis of the New CLT Multilinear Map over the Integers.", "fields": ["polynomial", "integer", "multilinear map", "security parameter", "cryptanalysis"], "abstract": "Multilinear maps serve as a basis for a wide range of cryptographic applications. The first candidate construction of multilinear maps was proposed by Garg, Gentry, and Halevi in 2013, and soon afterwards, another construction was suggested by Coron, Lepoint, and Tibouchi CLT13, which works over the integers. However, both of these were found to be insecure in the face of so-called zeroizing attacks, by Hu and Jia, and by Cheon, Han, Lee, Ryu and Stehle. To improve on CLT13, Coron, Lepoint, and Tibouchi proposed another candidate construction of multilinear maps over the integers at Crypto 2015 CLT15.\n\nThis article presents two polynomial attacks on the CLT15 multilinear map, which share ideas similar to the cryptanalysis of CLT13. Our attacks allow recovery of all secret parameters in time polynomial in the security parameter, and lead to a full break of the CLT15 multilinear map for virtually all applications.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Institut Universitaire de France", "Seoul National University", "University of Rennes", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Jung Hee Cheon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheon:Jung_Hee", "Pierre-Alain Fouque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fouque:Pierre=Alain", "Changmin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Changmin", "Brice Minaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minaud:Brice", "Hansol Ryu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryu:Hansol"], "pages": 28}
