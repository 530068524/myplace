We impose the following conditions: fully distributed solutions over an arbitrary network topology, and the requirement that resources allocated in a given auction are reserved for the entire duration of the connection, not subject to future contention. Under these conditions, we study the problem of selling capacity to optimize revenue for the operator. We first study optimal revenue for a single distributed auction in a general network. Next, the periodic auctions case is considered for a single link, modelling the optimal revenue problem as a Markov decision process (MDP); we develop a sequence of receding horizon approximations to its solution. Combining the two approaches we formulate a receding horizon optimization of revenue over a general network topology, that yields a distributed implementation. The proposal is demonstrated through simulations.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Fac. de Ing., U ... ica, Montevideo", "Facultad de Ing ...
