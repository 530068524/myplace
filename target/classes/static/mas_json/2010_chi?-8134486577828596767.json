We focus on communications broadcast by people who were \"on the ground\" during the Oklahoma Grassfires of April 2009 and the Red River Floods that occurred in March and April 2009, and identify information that may contribute to enhancing  situational awareness  (SA). This work aims to inform next steps for extracting useful, relevant information during emergencies using information extraction (IE) techniques.", "citation": "Citations (1,207)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "authors": ["Sarah Vieweg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vieweg:Sarah", "Amanda Lee Hughes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hughes:Amanda_Lee", "Kate Starbird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Starbird:Kate", "Leysia Palen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palen:Leysia"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
