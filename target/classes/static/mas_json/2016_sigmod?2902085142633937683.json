{"title": "PerfEnforce Demonstration: Data Analytics with Performance Guarantees.", "fields": ["service level agreement", "analytics", "dynamic scaling", "reinforcement learning", "data analysis"], "abstract": "We demonstrate PerfEnforce, a dynamic scaling engine for analytics services. PerfEnforce automatically scales a cluster of virtual machines in order to minimize costs while probabilistically meeting the query runtime guarantees offered by a performance-oriented service level agreement (SLA). The demonstration will show three families of dynamic scaling algorithms --feedback control, reinforcement learning, and online machine learning--and will enable attendees to change tuning parameters, performance thresholds, and workloads to compare and contrast the algorithms in different settings.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jennifer Ortiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ortiz:Jennifer", "Brendan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Brendan", "Magdalena Balazinska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balazinska:Magdalena"], "pages": 4}
