{"title": "REEF: Retainable Evaluator Execution Framework.", "fields": ["big data", "configuration management", "composability", "supercomputer", "analytics", "computational model", "state management", "cloud computing", "data management", "legacy code"], "abstract": "In this demo proposal, we describe REEF, a framework that makes it easy to implement scalable, fault-tolerant runtime environments for a range of computational models. We will demonstrate diverse workloads, including extract-transform-load MapReduce jobs, iterative machine learning algorithms, and ad-hoc declarative query processing. At its core, REEF builds atop YARN (Apache Hadoop 2's resource manager) to provide retainable hardware resources with lifetimes that are decoupled from those of computational tasks. This allows us to build persistent (cross-job) caches and cluster-wide services, but, more importantly, supports high-performance iterative graph processing and machine learning algorithms.\n\nUnlike existing systems, REEF aims for composability of jobs across computational models, providing significant performance and usability gains, even with legacy code. REEF includes a library of interoperable data management primitives optimized for communication and data movement (which are distinct from storage locality). The library also allows REEF applications to access external services, such as user-facing relational databases.\n\nWe were careful to decouple lower levels of REEF from the data models and semantics of systems built atop it. The result was two new standalone systems: Tang, a configuration manager and dependency injector, and Wake, a state-of-the-art event-driven programming and data movement framework. Both are language independent, allowing REEF to bridge the JVM and .NET.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Seoul National University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Markus Weimer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weimer:Markus", "Yingda Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yingda", "Byung-Gon Chun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chun:Byung=Gon", "Tyson Condie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Condie:Tyson", "Carlo Curino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curino:Carlo", "Chris Douglas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Douglas:Chris", "Yunseong Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yunseong", "Tony Majestro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majestro:Tony", "Dahlia Malkhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malkhi:Dahlia", "Sergiy Matusevych.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matusevych:Sergiy", "Brandon Myers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Myers:Brandon", "Shravan M.
