It has been a well-known open problem in parameterized computation and complexity whether the DFVS problem is fixed-parameter tractable, that is, whether the problem can be solved in time  f ( k ) n   O (1)  for some function  f . In this article, we develop new algorithmic techniques that result in an algorithm with running time 4  k    k e  n   O (1)  for the DFVS problem. Therefore, we resolve this open problem.", "citation": "Citations (263)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "University College Cork", "University College Cork", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "University College Cork", "University College Cork"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Jianer Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jianer", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Yang", "Songjian Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Songjian", "Barry O'Sullivan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Sullivan:Barry", "Igor Razgon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Razgon:Igor"], "pages": 10}
