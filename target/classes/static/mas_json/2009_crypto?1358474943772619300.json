An important application of this work is to the \"cold boot\" attacks of Halderman et al. We make new observations about the structure of RSA keys that allow our algorithm to make use of the redundant information in the typical storage format of an RSA private key. Our algorithm itself is elementary and does not make use of the lattice techniques used in other RSA key reconstruction problems. We give an analysis of the running time behavior of our algorithm that matches the threshold phenomenon observed in our experiments.", "citation": "Citations (116)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Nadia Heninger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heninger:Nadia", "Hovav Shacham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shacham:Hovav"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2009", "pages": 17}
