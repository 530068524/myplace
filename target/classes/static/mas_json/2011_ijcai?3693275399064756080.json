Our characterizations are relative to first-order logic, based on a wide range of semantic notions such as bisimulation, equisimulation, disjoint union, and direct product. We exemplify the use of the characterizations by a first study of the following novel family of decision problems: given a TBox T formulated in a DL L, decide whether T can be equivalently rewritten as a TBox in the fragment L\u2032 of L.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Liverpool", "University of Liverpool"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Carsten Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutz:Carsten", "Robert Piro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piro:Robert", "Frank Wolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolter:Frank"], "pages": 6}
