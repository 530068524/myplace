Classical models of trinocular geometry based on the fundamental matrices and trifocal tensor associated with the corresponding cameras only provide partial answers to this fundamental question, in large part because of underlying, but seldom explicit, general configuration assumptions. This paper uses elementary tools from projective line geometry to provide necessary and sufficient geometric and analytical conditions for convergence in terms of transversals to triplets of visual rays, without any such assumptions. In turn, this yields a novel and simple minimal parameterization of trinocular geometry for cameras with non-collinear or collinear pinholes.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Carnegie Mellon University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jean Ponce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponce:Jean", "Martial Hebert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hebert:Martial"], "pages": 8}
