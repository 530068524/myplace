{"title": "New Expressive Languages for Ontological Query Answering.", "fields": ["conjunctive query", "sql", "joins", "ontology language", "datalog"], "abstract": "Ontology-based data access is a powerful form of extending database technology, where a classical extensional database (EDB) is enhanced by an ontology that generates new intensional knowledge which may contribute to answer a query. Recently, the Datalog\u00b1 family of ontology languages was introduced; in Datalog\u00b1, rules are tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs), i.e., Datalog rules with the possibility of having existentially-quantified variables in the head. In this paper we introduce a novel Datalog\u00b1 language, namely sticky sets of TGDs, which allows for a wide class of joins in the body, while enjoying at the same time a low query-answering complexity. We establish complexity results for answering conjunctive queries under sticky sets of TGDs, showing, in particular, that ontological conjunctive queries can be compiled into first-order and thus SQL queries over the given EDB instance. We also show some extensions of sticky sets of TGDs, and how functional dependencies and so-called negative constraints can be added to a sticky set of TGDs without increasing the complexity of query answering. Our language thus properly generalizes both classical database constraints and most widespread tractable description logics.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Birkbeck, University of London", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Andrea Cal\u00ec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cal=igrave=:Andrea", "Georg Gottlob.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottlob:Georg", "Andreas Pieris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pieris:Andreas"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
