In contrast to previous studies that assume the support of the error matrix is generated by uniform Bernoulli sampling, we allow non-uniform sampling, i.e., entries of the low-rank matrix are corrupted by errors with unequal probabilities. We characterize conditions on error corruption of each individual entry based on the local incoherence of the low-rank matrix, under which correct matrix decomposition by PCP is guaranteed. Such a refined analysis of robust PCA captures how robust each entry of the low rank matrix combats error corruption. In order to deal with non-uniform error corruption, our technical proof introduces a new weighted norm and develops/exploits the concentration properties that such a norm satisfies.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Syracuse University", "Syracuse University", "Syracuse University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Huishuai Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Huishuai", "Yi Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yi", "Yingbin Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Yingbin"], "pages": 9}
