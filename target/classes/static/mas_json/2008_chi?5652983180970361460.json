In this paper, we present a solution, called LivOlay, that enables the rapid visual overlay of live data rendered in different applications. Our tool addresses datasets in which visual registration of the information is necessary in order to allow for thorough understanding and visual analysis. We also discuss initial evaluation and user feedback of LivOlay.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories", "Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories", "Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Hao Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Hao", "Daniel Wigdor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigdor:Daniel", "Clifton Forlines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forlines:Clifton", "Michelle Borkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borkin:Michelle", "Jens Kauffmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kauffmann:Jens", "Chia Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chia"], "pages": 4}
