{"title": "Can the Production Network Be the Testbed?", "fields": ["routing control plane", "forwarding plane", "vendor", "networking hardware", "downtime"], "abstract": "A persistent problem in computer network research is validation. When deciding how to evaluate a new feature or bug fix, a researcher or operator must trade-off realism (in terms of scale, actual user traffic, real equipment) and cost (larger scale costs more money, real user traffic likely requires downtime, and real equipment requires vendor adoption which can take years). Building a realistic testbed is hard because \"real\" networking takes place on closed, commercial switches and routers with special purpose hardware. But if we build our testbed from software switches, they run several orders of magnitude slower. Even if we build a realistic network testbed, it is hard to scale, because it is special purpose and is in addition to the regular network. It needs its own location, support and dedicated links. For a testbed to have global reach takes investment beyond the reach of most researchers.\n\nIn this paper, we describe a way to build a testbed that is embedded in--and thus grows with--the network. The technique--embodied in our first prototype, FlowVisor--slices the network hardware by placing a layer between the control plane and the data plane. We demonstrate that FlowVisor slices our own production network, with legacy protocols running in their own protected slice, alongside experiments created by researchers. The basic idea is that if unmodified hardware supports some basic primitives (in our prototype, Open-Flow, but others are possible), then a worldwide testbed can ride on the coat-tails of deployments, at no extra expense. Further, we evaluate the performance impact and describe how FlowVisor is deployed at seven other campuses as part of a wider evaluation platform.", "citation": "Citations (430)", "departments": ["Deutsche Telekom", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Switch", "Nicira Networks ...
