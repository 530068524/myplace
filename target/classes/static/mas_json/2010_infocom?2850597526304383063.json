Optimization and stochastic network theory have been successful in designing architectures for fair resource allocation to meet long-term throughput demands. However, to the best of our knowledge, strict packet delay deadlines were not considered in this framework previously. In this paper, we propose a model for incorporating the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of packets with deadlines in the optimization framework. The solution to the problem results in a joint congestion control and scheduling algorithm that fairly allocates resources to meet the fairness objectives of both elastic and inelastic flows and per-packet delay requirements of inelastic flows.", "citation": "Citations (115)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Juan Jos\u00e9 Jaramillo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaramillo:Juan_Jos=eacute=", "R.
