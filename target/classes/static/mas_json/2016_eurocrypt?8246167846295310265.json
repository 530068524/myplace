Here we introduce polytopic cryptanalysis which considers interdependencies between larger sets of texts as they traverse through the cipher. We prove that the methodology of standard differential cryptanalysis can unambiguously be extended and transferred to the polytopic case including impossible differentials. We show that impossible polytopic transitions have generic advantages over impossible differentials. To demonstrate the practical relevance of the generalization, we present new low-data attacks on round-reduced DES and AES using impossible polytopic transitions that are able to compete with existing attacks, partially outperforming these.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technical University of Denmark"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Tyge Tiessen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiessen:Tyge"], "pages": 26}
