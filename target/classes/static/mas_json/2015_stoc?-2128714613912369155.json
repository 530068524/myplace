{"title": "Near Optimal LP Rounding Algorithm for CorrelationClustering on Complete and Complete k-partite Graphs.", "fields": ["correlation clustering", "linear programming relaxation", "rounding", "triangle inequality", "long line"], "abstract": "We give new rounding schemes for the standard linear programming relaxation of the correlation clustering problem, achieving approximation factors almost matching the integrality gaps: For complete graphs our approximation is 2.06 - e, which almost matches the previously known integrality gap of 2. For complete k-partite graphs our approximation is 3. We also show a matching integrality gap. For complete graphs with edge weights satisfying triangle inequalities and probability constraints, our approximation is 1.5, and we show an integrality gap of 1.2.   Our results improve a long line of work on approximation algorithms for correlation clustering in complete graphs, previously culminating in a ratio of 2.5 for the complete case by Ailon, Charikar and Newman (JACM'08). In the weighted complete case satisfying triangle inequalities and probability constraints, the same authors give a 2-approximation; for the bipartite case, Ailon, Avigdor-Elgrabli, Liberty and van Zuylen give a 4-approximation (SICOMP'12).", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Microsoft", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shuchi Chawla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chawla_0001:Shuchi", "Konstantin Makarychev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makarychev:Konstantin", "Tselil Schramm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schramm:Tselil", "Grigory Yaroslavtsev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yaroslavtsev:Grigory"], "pages": 10}
