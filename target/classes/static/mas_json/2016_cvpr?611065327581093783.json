{"title": "Anticipating Visual Representations from Unlabeled Video.", "fields": ["human visual system model", "pattern recognition", "pixel", "computer vision", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Anticipating actions and objects before they start or appear is a difficult problem in computer vision with several real-world applications. This task is challenging partly because it requires leveraging extensive knowledge of the world that is difficult to write down. We believe that a promising resource for efficiently learning this knowledge is through readily available unlabeled video. We present a framework that capitalizes on temporal structure in unlabeled video to learn to anticipate human actions and objects. The key idea behind our approach is that we can train deep networks to predict the visual representation of images in the future. Visual representations are a promising prediction target because they encode images at a higher semantic level than pixels yet are automatic to compute. We then apply recognition algorithms on our predicted representation to anticipate objects and actions. We experimentally validate this idea on two datasets, anticipating actions one second in the future and objects five seconds in the future.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Carl Vondrick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vondrick:Carl", "Hamed Pirsiavash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pirsiavash:Hamed", "Antonio Torralba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torralba_0001:Antonio"], "pages": 9}
