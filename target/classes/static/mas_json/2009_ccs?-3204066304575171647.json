HAIL strengthens, formally unifies, and streamlines distinct approaches from the cryptographic and distributed-systems communities. Proofs in HAIL are efficiently computable by servers and highly compact---typically tens or hundreds of bytes, irrespective of file size. HAIL cryptographically verifies and reactively reallocates file shares. It is robust against an active, mobile adversary, i.e., one that may progressively corrupt the full set of servers. We propose a strong, formal adversarial model for HAIL, and rigorous analysis and parameter choices. We show how HAIL improves on the security and efficiency of existing tools, like Proofs of Retrievability (PORs) deployed on individual servers. We also report on a prototype implementation.", "citation": "Citations (1,139)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["RSA Laboratorie ... bridge, MA, USA", "RSA Laboratorie ... bridge, MA, USA", "RSA Laboratorie ... bridge, MA, USA"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Kevin D.
