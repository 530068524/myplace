Many algorithms, such as value iteration, have been proposed to optimize it. In risk-aware settings, however, the expected return is often not an appropriate objective to optimize. We propose a new optimization objective for risk-aware planning and show that it has desirable theoretical properties. We also draw connections to previously proposed objectives for risk-aware planing: minmax, exponential utility, percentile and mean minus variance. Our method applies to an extended class of Markov decision processes: we allow costs to be stochastic as long as they are bounded. Additionally, we present an efficient algorithm for optimizing the proposed objective. Synthetic and real-world experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our method, at scale.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Teodor Mihai Moldovan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moldovan:Teodor_Mihai", "Pieter Abbeel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbeel:Pieter"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
