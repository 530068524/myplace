{"title": "A* Search with Inconsistent Heuristics.", "fields": ["heuristic", "machine learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "heuristics"], "abstract": "Early research in heuristic search discovered that using inconsistent heuristics with A* could result in an exponential increase in the number of node expansions. As a result, the use of inconsistent heuristics has largely disappeared from practice. Recently, inconsistent heuristics have been shown to be effective in IDA*, especially when applying the bidirectional pathmax (BPMX) enhancement. This paper presents new worst-case complexity analysis of A*'s behavior with inconsistent heuristics, discusses how BPMX can be used with A*, and gives experimental results justifying the use of inconsistent heuristics in A* searches.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Zhifu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhifu", "Nathan R.
