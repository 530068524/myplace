Nowadays, there is little knowledge concerning suitable cost formulae and optimization strategies for exploring and constraining the tremendously large search space. To allow for a fair assessment of different optimization strategies, physical algebra operators, and indexing approaches, we developed an extensible optimization framework. The framework is accompanied by a supportive visual explain tool that enables user interactions to refine the inspection and the comprehension of the query plans proposed. Using this tool, the optimizer can be dynamically reconfigured and the impact of different optimization strategies on the final query execution plan can be immediately visualized.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology"], "authors": ["Andreas M.
