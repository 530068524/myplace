{"title": "A Rotational Stereo Model Based on XSlit Imaging.", "fields": ["epipolar geometry", "cylinder", "light field", "stereo camera", "parallax"], "abstract": "Traditional stereo matching assumes perspective viewing cameras under a translational motion: the second camera is translated away from the first one to create parallax. In this paper, we investigate a different, rotational stereo model on a special multi-perspective camera, the XSlit camera [9, 24]. We show that rotational XSlit (R-XSlit) stereo can be effectively created by fixing the sensor and slit locations but switching the two slits' directions. We first derive the epipolar geometry of R-XSlit in the 4D light field ray space. Our derivation leads to a simple but effective scheme for locating corresponding epipolar \"curves\". To conduct stereo matching, we further derive a new disparity term in our model and develop a patch-based graph-cut solution. To validate our theory, we assemble an XSlit lens by using a pair of cylindrical lenses coupled with slit-shaped apertures. The XSlit lens can be mounted on commodity cameras where the slit directions are adjustable to form desirable R-XSlit pairs. We show through experiments that R-XSlit provides a potentially advantageous imaging system for conducting fixed-location, dynamic baseline stereo.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Delaware", "University of Delaware", "University of Delaware"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jinwei Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jinwei", "Yu Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Yu", "Jingyi Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jingyi"], "pages": 8}
