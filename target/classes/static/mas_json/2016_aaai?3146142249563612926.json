{"title": "Building End-To-End Dialogue Systems Using Generative Hierarchical Neural Network Models.", "fields": ["generative grammar", "transfer of learning", "generative design", "bootstrapping", "end to end principle"], "abstract": "We investigate the task of building open domain, conversational dialogue systems based on large dialogue corpora using generative models. Generative models produce system responses that are autonomously generated word-by-word, opening up the possibility for realistic, flexible interactions. In support of this goal, we extend the recently proposed hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder neural network to the dialogue domain, and demonstrate that this model is competitive with state-of-the-art neural language models and backoff n-gram models. We investigate the limitations of this and similar approaches, and show how its performance can be improved by bootstrapping the learning from a larger question-answer pair corpus and from pretrained word embeddings.", "citation": "Citations (382)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Iulian Vlad Serban.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serban:Iulian_Vlad", "Alessandro Sordoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sordoni:Alessandro", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua", "Aaron C.
