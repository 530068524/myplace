This leads to ambiguous and noisy results. We propose to use adaptive visual similarity to re-rank the text-based search results. A query image is first categorized into one of several predefined intention categories, and a specific similarity measure is used inside each category to combine image features for re-ranking based on the query image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using this algorithm to filter output of Google and Live Image Search is a practical and effective way to dramatically improve the user experience. A real-time image search engine is developed for on-line image search with re-ranking: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/intentsearch", "citation": "Citations (208)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Jingyu Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Jingyu", "Fang Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Fang", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
