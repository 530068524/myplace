{"title": "Cryptanalysis of C2.", "fields": ["block cipher", "8 bit", "boomerang attack", "encryption", "cryptanalysis"], "abstract": "We present several attacks on the block cipher C2, which is used for encrypting DVD Audio discs and Secure Digital cards. C2 has a 56 bit key and a secret 8 to 8 bit S-box. We show that if the attacker is allowed to choose the key, the S-box can be recovered in 224 C2 encryptions. Attacking the 56 bit key for a known S-box can be done in complexity 248. Finally, a C2 implementation with a 8 to 8 bit secret S-box (equivalent to 2048 secret bits) and a 56 bit secret key can be attacked in 253.5 C2 encryptions on average.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Technical University of Denmark", "Technical University of Denmark", "Technical University of Denmark", "Technical University of Denmark"], "authors": ["Julia Borghoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borghoff:Julia", "Lars R.
