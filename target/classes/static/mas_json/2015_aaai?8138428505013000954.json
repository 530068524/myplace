{"title": "Finding a Collective Set of Items: From Proportional Multirepresentation to Group Recommendation.", "fields": ["computational complexity theory", "intrinsic value", "formal specification", "social choice theory", "computational social choice"], "abstract": "We consider the following problem: There is a set of items (e.g., movies) and a group of agents (e.g., passengers on a plane); each agent has some intrinsic utility for each of the items. Our goal is to pick a set of K items that maximize the total derived utility of all the agents (i.e., in our example we are to pick K movies that we put on the plane's entertainment system). However, the actual utility that an agent derives from a given item is only a fraction of its intrinsic one, and this fraction depends on how the agent ranks the item among the chosen, available, ones. We provide a formal specification of the model and provide concrete examples and settings where it is applicable. We show that the problem is hard in general, but we show a number of tractability results for its natural special cases.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "Paris Dauphine University", "AGH University, Poland"], "authors": ["Piotr Krzysztof Skowron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skowron:Piotr_Krzysztof", "Piotr Faliszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faliszewski:Piotr", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
