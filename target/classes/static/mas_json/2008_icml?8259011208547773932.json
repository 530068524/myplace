Our paper introduces a new inference algorithm for the infinite Hidden Markov model called  beam sampling . Beam sampling combines slice sampling, which limits the number of states considered at each time step to a finite number, with dynamic programming, which samples whole state trajectories efficiently. Our algorithm typically outperforms the Gibbs sampler and is more robust. We present applications of iHMM inference using the beam sampler on changepoint detection and text prediction problems.", "citation": "Citations (243)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University College London", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jurgen Van Gael.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gael:Jurgen_Van", "Yunus Saatci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saatci:Yunus", "Yee Whye Teh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teh:Yee_Whye", "Zoubin Ghahramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghahramani:Zoubin"], "pages": 8}
