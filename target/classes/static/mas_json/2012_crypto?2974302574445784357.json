All prior practical protocols were based on Yao's garbled circuits. We use an OT-based approach and get efficiency via OT extension in the random oracle model. To get a practical protocol we introduce a number of novel techniques for relating the outputs and inputs of OTs in a larger construction.\n\nWe also report on an implementation of this approach, that shows that our protocol is more efficient than any previous one: For big enough circuits, we can evaluate more than 20000 Boolean gates per second. As an example, evaluating one oblivious AES encryption $$\\sim 34000$$ gates takes 64i\u00be?seconds, but when repeating the task 27i\u00be?times it only takes less than 3i\u00be?seconds per instance.", "citation": "Citations (263)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati"], "authors": ["Jesper Buus Nielsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nielsen:Jesper_Buus", "Peter Sebastian Nordholt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nordholt:Peter_Sebastian", "Claudio Orlandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orlandi:Claudio", "Sai Sheshank Burra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burra:Sai_Sheshank"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 20}
