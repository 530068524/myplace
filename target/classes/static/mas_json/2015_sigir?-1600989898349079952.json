{"title": "Personalized Semantic Ranking for Collaborative Recommendation.", "fields": ["overfitting", "learning to rank", "pairwise comparison", "ranking", "user generated content"], "abstract": "Recently a ranking view of collaborative recommendation has received much attention in recommendation systems. Most of existing ranking approaches are based on pairwise assumption, i.e., everything that has not been selected is of less interest for a user. However it is usually not proper in many cases. To alleviate the limitation of this assumption, in this work, we present a unified framework, named Personalized Semantic Ranking (PSR). PSR models the personalized ranking and the user-generated content (UGC) simultaneously, and the semantic information extracted from UGC can make a remedy for the pairwise assumption. Moreover, utilizing the semantic information, PSR can capture the more subtle information of the user-item interaction and alleviate the overfitting problem caused by insufficient ratings. The learned topics in PSR can also serve as proper explanations for recommendation. Experimental results show that the proposed PSR yields significant improvements over the competitive compared methods on two typical datasets.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Song Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Song", "Shu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Shu", "Liang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Liang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
