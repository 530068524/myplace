{"title": "EdgeWrite with integrated corner sequence help.", "fields": ["speech recognition", "visualization", "computer science", "chart", "word error rate"], "abstract": "We describe a system that informs the users of the shape of the EdgeWrite characters within the visual feedback area of EdgeWrite. We compared two versions (static and dynamic) of this design to a printed character chart in a five-session text entry experiment with three 8-participant groups. The participants were able to use EdgeWrite with the integrated help systems. There were no statistically significant differences in text entry rate between the group using the character chart and the two groups using the integrated help. However, the group with the dynamic help was faster than the group with the static help while maintaining a low corrected error rate.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Metz", "University of Tampere"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Beno\u00eet Martin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martin:Beno=icirc=t", "Poika Isokoski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isokoski:Poika"], "pages": 10}
