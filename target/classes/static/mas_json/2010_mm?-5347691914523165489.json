A popular approach to producing an image without under- and over-exposed areas is to capture several input images with varying exposure settings, and later merge them into a single high-quality result using offline image processing software. We present a system for creating images of high-dynamic-range (HDR) scenes that operates entirely on a mobile camera. Our system consists of an automatic HDR metering algorithm that determines which exposures to capture, a video-rate viewfinder preview algorithm that allows the user to verify the dynamic range that will be recorded, and a light-weight image merging algorithm that computes a high-quality result directly on the camera. By using our system, a photographer can capture, view, and share images of HDR scenes directly on camera, without using offline image processing software", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nokia", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Nokia"], "authors": ["Natasha Gelfand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gelfand:Natasha", "Andrew Adams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adams:Andrew", "Sung Hee Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Sung_Hee", "Kari Pulli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pulli:Kari"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
