As an application, we focus on the problem of automatically learning commutativity specifications of data structures. This is a very challenging problem, yet important, as commutativity specifications are fundamental to program analysis, concurrency control and even lower bounds.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Timon Gehr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehr:Timon", "Dimitar Dimitrov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dimitrov:Dimitar", "Martin T.
