{"title": "Amdahl's Law in the Datacenter Era: A Market for Fair Processor Allocation.", "fields": ["amdahl s law", "workload", "multi core processor", "entitlement", "market mechanism"], "abstract": "We present a processor allocation framework that uses Amdahl's Law to model parallel performance and a market mechanism to allocate cores. First, we propose the Amdahl utility function and demonstrate its accuracy when modeling performance from processor core allocations. Second, we design a market based on Amdahl utility that optimizes users' bids for processors based on workload parallelizability. The framework uses entitlements to guarantee fairness yet outperforms existing proportional share algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Seyed Majid Zahedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zahedi:Seyed_Majid", "Qiuyun Llull.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Llull:Qiuyun", "Benjamin C.
