In this work, we target the problem of gathering data from the crowd in an economical and principled fashion. We present Ask It!, a system that allows interactive data sourcing applications to effectively determine which questions should be directed to which users for reducing the uncertainty about the collected data. Ask It! uses a set of novel algorithms for minimizing the number of probing (questions) required from the different users. We demonstrate the challenge and our solution in the context of a multiple-choice question game played by the ICDE'12 attendees, targeted to gather information on the conference's publications, authors and colleagues.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Rubi Boim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boim:Rubi", "Ohad Greenshpan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenshpan:Ohad", "Tova Milo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milo:Tova", "Slava Novgorodov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novgorodov:Slava", "Neoklis Polyzotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polyzotis:Neoklis", "Wang Chiew Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Wang_Chiew"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
