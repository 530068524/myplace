Given a user query, the technique of query expansion (QE) consists in selecting related terms that could enhance the likelihood of retrieving relevant documents. Selecting such expansion terms is challenging and requires a computational framework capable of encoding complex semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning, in a supervised way, semantic representations for words and phrases. By embedding queries and documents in special matrices, our model disposes of an increased representational power with respect to existing approaches adopting a vector representation. We show that our model produces high-quality query expansion terms. Our expansion increase IR measures beyond expansion from current word-embeddings models and well-established traditional QE methods.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["DIRO, Universit ... ntr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec", "DIRO, Universit ... ntr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec", "DIRO, Universit ... ntr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec"], "authors": ["Alessandro Sordoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sordoni:Alessandro", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua", "Jian-Yun Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Jian=Yun"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
