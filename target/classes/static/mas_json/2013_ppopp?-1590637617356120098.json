Still, JavaScript lacks support for shared memory parallelism, making it challenging for developers to exploit multicores present in both servers and clients. In this paper we present TigerQuoll, a novel API and runtime for parallel programming in JavaScript. TigerQuoll features an event-based API and a parallel runtime allowing applications to exploit a mutable shared memory space. The programming model of TigerQuoll features automatic consistency and concurrency management, such that developers do not have to deal with shared-data synchronization. TigerQuoll supports an innovative transaction model that allows for eventual consistency to speed up high-contention workloads. Experiments show that TigerQuoll applications scale well, allowing one to implement common parallelism patterns in JavaScript.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Daniele Bonetta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonetta:Daniele", "Walter Binder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Binder:Walter", "Cesare Pautasso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pautasso:Cesare"], "pages": 10}
