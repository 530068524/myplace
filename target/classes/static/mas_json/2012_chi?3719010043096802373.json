One example of such a task is itinerary planning, where solutions consist of a sequence of activities that meet requirements specified by the requester. In this paper, we focus on the crowdsourcing of such plans as a case study of constraint-based human computation tasks and introduce a collaborative planning system called Mobi that illustrates a novel crowdware paradigm. Mobi presents a single interface that enables crowd participants to view the current solution context and make appropriate contributions based on current needs. We conduct experiments that explain how Mobi enables a crowd to effectively and collaboratively resolve global constraints, and discuss how the design principles behind Mobi can more generally facilitate a crowd to tackle problems involving global constraints.", "citation": "Citations (161)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Haoqi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haoqi", "Edith Law.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Law:Edith", "Rob Miller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miller_0001:Rob", "Krzysztof Gajos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gajos:Krzysztof", "David C.
