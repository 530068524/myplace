Along the way, we formed an open community to collaborate on adapting this architecture to various tool domains. Finally, we discuss our experience delivering the first generation of tools built and integrated using these techniques.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Durham University"], "authors": ["Scott Rich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rich:Scott"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
