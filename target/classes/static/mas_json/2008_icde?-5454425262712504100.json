{"title": "On Anti-Corruption Privacy Preserving Publication.", "fields": ["stratified sampling", "adversary", "information privacy", "computer security", "corruption"], "abstract": "This paper deals with a new type of privacy threat, called \"corruption\" in anonymized data publication. Specifically, an adversary is said to have corrupted some individuals, if s/he has already obtained their sensitive values before consulting the released information. Conventional generalization may lead to severe privacy disclosure in the presence of corruption. Motivated by this, we advocate an alternative anonymization technique that integrates generalization with perturbation and stratified sampling. The integration provides strong privacy guarantees, even if an adversary has corrupted any number of individuals. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique through experiments with real data.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei", "Xiaokui Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Xiaokui", "Jiexing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiexing", "Donghui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Donghui"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
