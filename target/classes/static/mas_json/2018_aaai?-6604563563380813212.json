The latent memberships evolve according to a Markov process. The optimal\nnumber of latent groups can be determined by data itself. The computational complexity of our method scales with the number of non-zero links, which makes it scalable to large sparse dynamic relational data. We present batch and online Gibbs sampling algorithms to perform model inference. Finally, we demonstrate the model\u2019s performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Sikun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Sikun", "Heinz Koeppl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koeppl:Heinz"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
