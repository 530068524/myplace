First, the dynamic range of well exposed region is slightly compressed to make room for the recovered lightness of the over-exposed region. Then the lightness is recovered based on an over-exposure likelihood. The color of each pixel is corrected via neighborhood propagation and also based on the confidence of the original color. Previous methods make use of ratios between different color channels to recover the over-exposed ones, and thus can not handle regions where all three channels are over-exposed. In contrast, our method does not have this limitation. Our method is fully automatic and requires only one single input photo. We also provide users with the flexibility to control the amount of over-exposure correction. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in correcting over-exposure.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo_0001:Dong", "Yuan Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Yuan", "Shaojie Zhuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuo:Shaojie", "Terence Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Terence"], "pages": 7}
