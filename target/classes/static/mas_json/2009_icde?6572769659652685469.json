The highly dynamic environment created by mobile devices introduces a silent failure mode that is disruptive to this kind of inference. We address this problem by presenting techniques for extending existing unstructured aggregation protocols to cope with failure modes introduced by mobile environments. The modified protocols allow devices with limited connectivity to maintain estimates of aggregates, despite \\textit{unexpected} peer departures and arrivals.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Oliver Kennedy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kennedy:Oliver", "Christoph Koch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koch_0001:Christoph", "Alan J.
