We explore new directions with forecasting weather as a data-intensive challenge that involves inferences across space and time. We study specifically the power of making predictions via a hybrid approach that combines discriminatively trained predictive models with a deep neural network that models the joint statistics of a set of weather-related variables. We show how the base model can be enhanced with spatial interpolation that uses learned long-range spatial dependencies. We also derive an efficient learning and inference procedure that allows for large scale optimization of the model parameters. We evaluate the methods with experiments on real-world meteorological data that highlight the promise of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Aditya Grover.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grover:Aditya", "Ashish Kapoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapoor:Ashish", "Eric Horvitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horvitz:Eric"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
