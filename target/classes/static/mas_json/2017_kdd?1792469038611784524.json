We propose SUBKMEANS, which extends the classic  k -means algorithm. The goal of this algorithm is twofold: find a sufficient  k -means-style clustering partition and transform the clusters onto a common subspace, which is optimal for the cluster structure. Our solution is able to pursue these two goals simultaneously. The dimensionality of this subspace is found automatically and therefore the algorithm comes without the burden of additional parameters. At the same time this subspace helps to mitigate the  curse of dimensionality . The SUBKMEANS optimization algorithm is intriguingly simple and efficient. It is easy to implement and can readily be adopted to the current situation. Furthermore, it is compatible to many existing extensions and improvements of  k -means.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "University of Vienna", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "authors": ["Dominik Mautz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mautz:Dominik", "Wei Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Wei", "Claudia Plant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plant:Claudia", "Christian B\u00f6hm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hm:Christian"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
