Customer calls for technical support provide direct indication as to the problems customers encounter. In this paper, we study the customer tickets - free-text recordings and classifications by customer support agents - collected at a large cellular network provider, with two inter-related goals: i) to characterize and understand the major factors which lead to customers to call and seek support; and ii) to utilize such customer tickets to help identify potential network problems. For this purpose, we develop a novel statistical approach to model customer call rates which account for customer-side factors (e.g., user tenure and handset types) and geo-locations. We show that most calls are due to customer-side factors and can be well captured by the model. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that location-specific deviations from the model provide a good indicator of potential network-side issues.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs"], "authors": ["Yu Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin_0001:Yu", "Nick G.
