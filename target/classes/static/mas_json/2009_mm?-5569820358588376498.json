First, we propose a new distance metric called Tensor Distance (TD) to build a relationship graph of data points with high-order. Then we employ an iterative strategy to sequentially learn the transformation matrices that can best keep pair-wise TDs of the high-order data in the low-dimensional embedded space. By integrating both tensor distance and tensor embedding, TD-MMDS provides a uniform framework of tensor based dimensionality reduction, which preserves the intrinsic structure of high-order data through the whole learning procedure. Experiments on standard image and video datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed TD-MMDS.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0007:Yang", "Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0004:Yan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
