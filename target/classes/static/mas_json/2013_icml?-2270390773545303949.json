{"title": "A PAC-Bayesian Approach for Domain Adaptation with Specialization to Linear Classifiers.", "fields": ["bayesian probability", "domain adaptation", "machine learning", "classifier", "annotation"], "abstract": "We provide a first PAC-Bayesian analysis for domain adaptation (DA) which arises when the learning and test distributions differ. It relies on a novel distribution pseudodistance based on a disagreement averaging. Using this measure, we derive a PAC-Bayesian DA bound for the stochastic Gibbs classifier. This bound has the advantage of being directly optimizable for any hypothesis space. We specialize it to linear classifiers, and design a learning algorithm which shows interesting results on a synthetic problem and on a popular sentiment annotation task. This opens the door to tackling DA tasks by making use of all the PAC-Bayesian tools.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Laval University", "Jean Monnet University", "Laval University", "Aix-Marseille University"], "authors": ["Pascal Germain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Germain:Pascal", "Amaury Habrard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habrard:Amaury", "Fran\u00e7ois Laviolette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laviolette:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Emilie Morvant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morvant:Emilie"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
