{"title": "EFFORT: Efficient and effective bot malware detection.", "fields": ["cryptovirology", "malware", "architecture", "multitier architecture", "server"], "abstract": "To detect bots, a lot of detection approaches have been proposed at host or network level so far and both approaches have clear advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we propose EFFORT, a new host-network cooperated detection framework attempting to overcome shortcomings of both approaches while still keeping both advantages, i.e., effectiveness and efficiency. Based on intrinsic characteristics of bots, we propose a multi-module approach to correlate information from different host- and network-level aspects and design a multi-layered architecture to efficiently coordinate modules to perform heavy monitoring only when necessary. We have implemented our proposed system and evaluated on real-world benign and malicious programs running on several diverse real-life office and home machines for several days. The final results show that our system can detect all 15 real-world bots (e.g., Waledac, Storm) with low false positives (0.68%) and with minimal overhead. We believe EFFORT raises a higher bar and this host-network cooperated design represents a timely effort and a right direction in the malware battle.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Seungwon Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Seungwon", "Zhaoyan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zhaoyan", "Guofei Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Guofei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
