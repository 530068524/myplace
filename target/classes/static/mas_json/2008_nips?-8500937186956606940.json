However, this function is often expensive to compute exactly. We here present a method derived from the study of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces which takes advantage of the regular structure of the space of all graphs on a fixed number of nodes to obtain approximations to the desired function quickly and with reasonable accuracy. We then test this method on both a small testing set and a real-world Bayesian network; the results suggest that not only is this method reasonably accurate, but that the BDe score itself varies quadratically over the space of all graphs.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of New Mexico", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "University of New Mexico"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Benjamin Yackley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yackley:Benjamin", "Eduardo Corona.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Corona:Eduardo", "Terran Lane.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lane:Terran"], "pages": 8}
