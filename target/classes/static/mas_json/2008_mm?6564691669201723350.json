In contrast to previous research we represent multimedia content by a vector of keywords instead of a vector of low-level features. This vector of keywords can be obtained through user manual annotations or computed by an automatic annotation algorithm. In this setting, we studied the influence of two aspects of the search by semantic similarity process: (1) accuracy of user keywords versus automatic keywords and (2) functions to compute semantic similarity between keyword vectors of two multimedia documents. We consider these two aspects to be crucial in the design of a keyword space that can exploit social-media information and can enrich applications such as Flickr and YouTube. Experiments were performed on an image and a video dataset with a large number of keywords, with different similarity functions and with two annotation methods. Surprisingly, we found that multimedia semantic similarity with automatic keywords performs as good as or better than 95% accurate user keywords.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "University of Sheffield", "Open University"], "authors": ["Jo\u00e3o Magalh\u00e3es.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magalh=atilde=es:Jo=atilde=o", "Fabio Ciravegna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciravegna:Fabio", "Stefan M.
