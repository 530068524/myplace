We develop a novel multi-objective learning method that optimizes a single unified deep convolutional network with two distinct non-structured loss functions: one encoding the unary label likelihoods and the other encoding the pairwise label dependencies. Moreover, we regularize the network by using a nonparametric prior as new input channels in addition to the RGB image, and show that significant performance improvements can be achieved with a much smaller network size. Experiments on both the LFW and Helen datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results of the proposed algorithm, and accurate labeling results on challenging images can be obtained by the proposed algorithm for real-world applications.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Merced", "University of California, Merced", "Baidu", "University of California, Merced"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sifei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Sifei", "Jimei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jimei", "Chang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chang", "Ming-Hsuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Ming=Hsuan"], "pages": 9}
