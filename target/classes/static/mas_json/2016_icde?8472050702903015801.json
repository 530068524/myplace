While many bodies of techniques were proposed to search complex patterns and enhance the expressive power of query language, no previous work focused on supporting a well-defined ranking mechanism over answers using semantic ordering. To satisfy this need, we proposed CEPR, a CEP system capable of ranking matchings and emitting ordered results based on users' intentions via a novel query language. In this demo, we will (i) demonstrate language features, system architecture and functionalities, (ii) show examples of CEPR in various application domains and (iii) present a user-friendly interface to monitor query results and interact with the system in real time.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Jiaqi Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Jiaqi", "Jin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jin", "Carlo Zaniolo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaniolo:Carlo"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
