Presented here is a design exemplar: the Assistive, Robotic Table (ART), the key component of our envisioned home suite of networked, robotic furnishings for hospitals and homes, promoting wellbeing and independent living. We begin with the motivations for ART, and present our iterative, five-phase, participatory design-and-evaluation process involving clinicians at a rehabilitation hospital, focusing here on the final usability study. From our wide-ranging design-research activities, which may be characterized as research through design, we found ART to be promising but also challenging. As a design exemplar, ART offers invaluable lessons to the CHI community as it comes to design larger-scale, cyber-physical artifacts cultivating interactions across people and their surroundings that define places of social, cultural and psychological significance.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Clemson University", "Clemson University", "Clemson University", "Clemson University", "Clemson University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Anthony Threatt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Threatt:Anthony", "Jessica Merino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Merino:Jessica", "Keith Evan Green.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Green:Keith_Evan", "Ian D.
