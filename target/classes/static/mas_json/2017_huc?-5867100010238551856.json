The proposed puzzle-solving method is valid for both apictorial and pictorial jigsaw puzzles. JigsawGo enables all non-overlapping and randomly placed puzzle pieces to be identified and gathered piece by piece to be placed in the corresponding puzzle-piece slot using the robotic arm.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Yuan Ze University", "Yuan Ze University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Huang-Chia Shih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shih:Huang=Chia", "Jian-Liang Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Jian=Liang", "Christine Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Christine"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
