{"title": "Synthesizing Strategies for Epistemic Goals by Epistemic Model Checking: An Application to Pursuit Evasion Games.", "fields": ["machine learning", "special case", "pursuit evasion", "model checking", "complete information"], "abstract": "The paper identifies a special case in which the complex problem of synthesis from specifications in temporal-epistemic logic can be reduced to the simpler problem of model checking such specifications. An application is given of strategy synthesis in pursuit-evasion games, where one or more pursuers with incomplete information aim to discover the existence of an evader. Experimental results are provided to evaluate the feasibility of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Xiaowei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xiaowei", "Ron van der Meyden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyden:Ron_van_der"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
