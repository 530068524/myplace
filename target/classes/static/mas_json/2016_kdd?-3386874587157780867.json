Nevertheless, this problem has rarely been investigated. In addition to using the low-rank structure to depict label correlations, this paper explores and exploits an additional sparse component to handle tail labels behaving as outliers, in order to make the classical low-rank principle in multi-label learning valid. The divide-and-conquer optimization technique is employed to increase the scalability of the proposed algorithm while theoretically guaranteeing its performance. A theoretical analysis of the generalizability of the proposed algorithm suggests that it can be improved by the low-rank and sparse decomposition given tail labels. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate the significance of investigating tail labels and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Chang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0002:Chang", "Dacheng Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Dacheng", "Chao Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0006:Chao"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
