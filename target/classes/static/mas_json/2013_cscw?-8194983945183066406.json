While many of these efforts have been successful, it remains difficult to create citizen science applications without extensive programming expertise. To address this concern, we present Sensr, an authoring environment that enables people without programming skills to build mobile data collection and management tools for citizen science. We demonstrate how Sensr allows people without technical skills to create mobile applications. Findings from our case study demonstrate that our system successfully overcomes technical constraints and provides a simple way to create mobile data collection tools.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Sunyoung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sunyoung", "Jennifer Mankoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mankoff:Jennifer", "Eric Paulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paulos:Eric"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
