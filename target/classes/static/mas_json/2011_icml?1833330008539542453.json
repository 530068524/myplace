{"title": "A PAC-Bayes Sample-compression Approach to Kernel Methods.", "fields": ["radial basis function kernel", "bounded function", "compression", "bayes theorem", "kernel method"], "abstract": "We propose a PAC-Bayes sample compression approach to kernel methods that can accommodate any bounded similarity function and show that the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is a particular case of a more general class of data-dependent classifiers known as majority votes of sample-compressed classifiers. We provide novel risk bounds for these majority votes and learning algorithms that minimize these bounds.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Laval University", "Laval University", "Laval University", "Laval University", "Laval University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Pascal Germain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Germain:Pascal", "Alexandre Lacoste.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lacoste:Alexandre", "Fran\u00e7ois Laviolette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laviolette:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Mario Marchand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marchand:Mario", "Sara Shanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shanian:Sara"], "pages": 8}
