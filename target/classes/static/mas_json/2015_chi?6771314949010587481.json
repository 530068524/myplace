In this paper, we introduce the SplitBoard, which is a soft keyboard designed for a smartwatch. As the user flicks left or right on the keyboard, it switches between the left and right halves of a QWERTY keyboard. We report the results of two user experiments where the SplitBoard was compared to an ordinary QWERTY keyboard, the ZoomBoard, SlideBoard, and Qwerty-like keypad. We measured the initial performance with new users for each method. The SplitBoard outperformed all other techniques in the experiments. The SplitBoard is expected to be a viable option for smartwatch text entry because of its light processing requirements, good performance, and immediate learnability.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "University of Tampere", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jonggi Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Jonggi", "Seongkook Heo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heo:Seongkook", "Poika Isokoski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isokoski:Poika", "Geehyuk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Geehyuk"], "pages": 4}
