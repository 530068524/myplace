{"title": "Hails: Protecting Data Privacy in Untrusted Web Applications.", "fields": ["web application", "privacy policy", "information privacy", "mandatory access control", "extensibility", "data access"], "abstract": "Modern extensible web platforms like Facebook and Yammer depend on third-party software to offer a rich experience to their users. Unfortunately, users running a third-party \"app\" have little control over what it does with their private data. Today's platforms offer only ad-hoc constraints on app behavior, leaving users an unfortunate trade-off between convenience and privacy. A principled approach to code confinement could allow the integration of untrusted codewhile enforcing flexible, end-to-end policies on data access. This paper presents a new web framework, Hails, that adds mandatory access control and a declarative policy language to the familiar MVC architecture. We demonstrate the flexibility of Hails through GitStar.com, a code-hosting website that enforces robust privacy policies on user data even while allowing untrusted apps to deliver extended features to users.", "citation": "Citations (118)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Daniel B.
