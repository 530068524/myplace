B-FQI is an iterative off-line algorithm that, given a dataset of transitions, builds an approximation of the optimal action-value function by summing the approximations of the Bell-man residuals across all iterations. The advantage of such approach w.r.t. to other AVI methods is twofold: (1) while keeping the same function space at each iteration, B-FQI can represent more complex functions by considering an additive model; (2) since the Bellman residual decreases as the optimal value function is approached , regression problems become easier as iterations proceed. We study B-FQI both theoretically , providing also a finite-sample error upper bound for it, and empirically, by comparing its performance to the one of FQI in different domains and using different regression techniques.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Samuele Tosatto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tosatto:Samuele", "Matteo Pirotta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pirotta:Matteo", "Carlo D'Eramo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=Eramo:Carlo", "Marcello Restelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Restelli:Marcello"], "pages": 10}
