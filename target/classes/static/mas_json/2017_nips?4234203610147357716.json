{"title": "Faster and Non-ergodic O(1/K) Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers.", "fields": ["variance reduction", "regular polygon", "extrapolation", "separable space", "ergodic theory"], "abstract": "We study stochastic convex optimization subjected to linear equality constraints. Traditional Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers and its Nesterov's acceleration scheme can only achieve ergodic O(1/\\sqrt{K}) convergence rates, where K is the number of iteration. By introducing Variance Reduction (VR) techniques, the convergence rates improve to ergodic O(1/K). In this paper, we propose a new stochastic ADMM which elaborately integrates Nesterov's extrapolation and VR techniques. With Nesterov\u2019s extrapolation, our algorithm can achieve a non-ergodic O(1/K) convergence rate which is optimal for separable linearly constrained non-smooth convex problems, while the convergence rates of VR based ADMM methods are actually tight O(1/\\sqrt{K}) in non-ergodic sense. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves a truly accelerated, stochastic convergence rate for constrained convex problems. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is significantly faster than the existing state-of-the-art stochastic ADMM methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Cong Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Cong", "Feng Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Feng", "Zhouchen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhouchen"], "pages": 10}
