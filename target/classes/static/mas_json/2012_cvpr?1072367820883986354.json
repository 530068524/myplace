Computer vision thus starts evolving to cross-modal sensing, where vision and other sensors cooperate. This exists in humans and animals, reflecting nature, where visual events are often accompanied with sounds. Can vision assist in denoising another modality? As a case study, we demonstrate this principle by using video to denoise audio. Unimodal (audio-only) denoising is very difficult when the noise source is non-stationary, complex (e.g., another speaker or music in the background), strong and not individually accessible in any modality (unseen). Cross-modal association can help: a clear video can direct the audio estimator. We show this using an example-based approach. A training movie having clear audio provides cross-modal examples. In testing, cross-modal input segments having noisy audio rely on the examples for denoising. The video channel drives the search for relevant training examples. We demonstrate this in speech and music experiments.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dana Segev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segev:Dana", "Yoav Y.
