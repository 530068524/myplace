To this aim, we introduce pushdown game structures over which ATL? formulas are interpreted. We show an algorithm that solves the addressed model-checking problem in 3EXPTIME. We also provide a 2EXPSPACE lower bound by showing a reduction from the word acceptance problem for deterministic Turing machines with doubly exponential space.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Universit\u00e0 degl ...  \"Federico II\""], "authors": ["Aniello Murano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murano:Aniello", "Giuseppe Perelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perelli:Giuseppe"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
