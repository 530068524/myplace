{"title": "Improved Short Lattice Signatures in the Standard Model.", "fields": ["random oracle", "lattice problem", "standard model", "polynomial", "public key cryptography"], "abstract": "We present a signature scheme provably secure in the standard model (no random oracles) based on the worst-case complexity of approximating the Shortest Vector Problem in ideal lattices within polynomial factors. The distinguishing feature of our scheme is that it achieves short signatures (consisting of a single lattice vector), and relatively short public keys (consisting of O(logn) vectors.) Previous lattice schemes in the standard model with similarly short signatures, due to Boyen (PKC 2010) and Micciancio and Peikert (Eurocrypt 2012), had substantially longer public keys consisting of \u03a9(n) vectors (even when implemented with ideal lattices).", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "authors": ["L\u00e9o Ducas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ducas:L=eacute=o", "Daniele Micciancio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micciancio:Daniele"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2014", "pages": 18}
