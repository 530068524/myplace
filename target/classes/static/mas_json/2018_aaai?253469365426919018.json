{"title": "Multiagent Simple Temporal Problem: The Arc-Consistency Approach.", "fields": ["local consistency", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The Simple Temporal Problem (STP) is a fundamental temporal reasoning problem and has recently been extended to the Multiagent Simple Temporal Problem (MaSTP). In this paper we present a novel approach that is based on enforcing arc-consistency (AC) on the input (multiagent) simple temporal network. We show that the AC-based approach is sufficient for solving both the STP and MaSTP and provide efficient algorithms for them. As our AC-based approach does not impose new constraints between agents, it does not violate the privacy of the agents and is superior to the state-of-the-art approach to MaSTP. Empirical evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets also show that our AC-based algorithms for STP and MaSTP are significantly more efficient than existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "authors": ["Shufeng Kong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kong:Shufeng", "Jae Hee Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Jae_Hee", "Sanjiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Sanjiang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
