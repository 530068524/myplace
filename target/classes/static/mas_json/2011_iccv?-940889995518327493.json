While recent work focuses on object-centered representations of point-based object features, we revisit the viewer-centered framework, and use image contours as basic features. Given training examples of arbitrary views of an object, we learn a sparse object model in terms of a few view-dependent shape templates. The shape templates are jointly used for detecting object occurrences and estimating their 3D poses in a new image. Instrumental to this is our new mid-level feature, called bag of boundaries (BOB), aimed at lifting from individual edges toward their more informative summaries for identifying object boundaries amidst the background clutter. In inference, BOBs are placed on deformable grids both in the image and the shape templates, and then matched. This is formulated as a convex optimization problem that accommodates invariance to non-rigid, locally affine shape deformations. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our competitive results relative to the state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Nadia Payet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Payet:Nadia", "Sinisa Todorovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Todorovic:Sinisa"], "pages": 8}
