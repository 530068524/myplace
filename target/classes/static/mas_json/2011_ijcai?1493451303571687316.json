In this paper, we explore recognition of a few typical affective metaphorical phenomena and context-based affect sensing using the modeling of speakers' improvisational mood and other participants' emotional influence to the speaking character under the improvisation of loose scenarios. The overall updated affect detection module is embedded in an AI agent. The new developments have enabled the AI agent to perform generally better in affect sensing tasks. The work emphasizes the conference themes on affective dialogue processing, human-agent interaction and intelligent user interfaces.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Teesside University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Li Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Li"], "pages": 6}
