Based on a minimal user input, the algorithm interactively determines the objects' silhouette and subsequently computes a silhouette-consistent 3D model which is precisely the globally minimal surface with user-specified volume. In contrast to a recently published approach to single view reconstruction, the proposed algorithm does not constrain the resolution in the depth-direction, it assures the global optimum and is faster by about an order of magnitude. Experiments demonstrate that plausible highresolution 3D models can be generated in fractions of a second and compare favorably with other methods.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Martin R.
