{"title": "Bridging the Theory-Practice Gap: Lessons and Challenges of Applying the Attachment Framework for Sustainable HCI Design.", "fields": ["management science", "bridging", "product design", "novelty", "computer science"], "abstract": "Despite significant progress in sustainable HCI towards theoretical frameworks to guide design, there is a gap between theory and practice, so that the impact of such frameworks is limited. As an initial exploration in bridging the theory-practice gap, we conducted a study using one well-established design framework, the Attachment Framework, to evaluate its applicability in use. We conducted a comparative study with 14 designers to explore the effect of the Attachment Framework on design, and evaluated their designs with 10 design experts using a set of six design criteria. Our results indicated a positive effect on the criterion of novelty, with mixed effects on attachment, presentation, aesthetics, usefulness, and feasibility. We contribute a set of challenges in the application of design frameworks to practice and offer a critical reflection on how researchers can more effectively communicate sustainable HCI design frameworks to practitioners.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "CSS Insurance,  ... ne, Switzerland"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christian Remy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Remy_0001:Christian", "Silke Gegenbauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gegenbauer:Silke", "Elaine M.
