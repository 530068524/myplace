{"title": "Environment rematching: Toward dependability improvement for self-adaptive applications.", "fields": ["dependability", "mobile robot", "atomicity", "computer science", "reliability engineering"], "abstract": "Self-adaptive applications can easily contain faults. Existing approaches detect faults, but can still leave some undetected and manifesting into failures at runtime. In this paper, we study the correlation between occurrences of application failure and those of consistency failure. We propose fixing consistency failure to reduce application failure at runtime. We name this environment rematching, which can systematically reconnect a self-adaptive application to its environment in a consistent way. We also propose enforcing atomicity for application semantics during the rematching to avoid its side effect. We evaluated our approach using 12 self-adaptive robot-car applications by both simulated and real experiments. The experimental results confirmed our approach's effectiveness in improving dependability for all applications by 12.5-52.5%.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Chang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Chang", "Wenhua Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Wenhua", "Xiaoxing Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiaoxing", "Chun Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Chun", "Jian Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0001:Jian"], "pages": 6}
