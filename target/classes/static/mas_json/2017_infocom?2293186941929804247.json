Furthermore, most of today's C&C protocols are encrypted, which prevents any analysis on the traffic without first discovering the encryption algorithm and key. To address these challenges, we present an end-to-end system for automatically discovering the encryption algorithm and keys, generating a protocol specification for the C&C traffic, and crafting effective network signatures. In order to infer the encryption algorithm and key, we enhance state-of-the-art techniques to extract this information using lightweight binary analysis. In order to generate protocol specifications we infer field types purely by analyzing network traffic. We evaluate our approach on three prominent malware families: Sality, ZeroAccess and Ramnit. Our results are encouraging: the approach decrypts all three protocols, detects 97% of fields whose semantics are supported, and infers specifications that correctly align with real protocol specifications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Colorado State University", "Symantec", "Symantec", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "RedLock Inc."], "authors": ["Lorenzo De Carli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carli:Lorenzo_De", "Ruben Torres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torres:Ruben", "Gaspar Modelo-Howard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Modelo=Howard:Gaspar", "Alok Tongaonkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tongaonkar:Alok", "Somesh Jha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jha:Somesh"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
