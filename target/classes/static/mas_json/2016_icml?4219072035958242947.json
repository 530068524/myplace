The Automatic Bayesian Covariance Discovery (ABCD) system constructs natural-language description of time-series data by treating unknown time-series data nonparametrically using GP with a composite covariance kernel function. Unfortunately, learning a composite covariance kernel with a single time-series data set often results in less informative kernel that may not give qualitative, distinctive descriptions of data. We address this challenge by proposing two relational kernel learning methods which can model multiple time-series data sets by finding common, shared causes of changes. We show that the relational kernel learning methods find more accurate models for regression problems on several real-world data sets; US stock data, US house price index data and currency exchange rate data.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yunseong Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Yunseong", "Anh Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Anh", "Jaesik Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jaesik"], "pages": 10}
