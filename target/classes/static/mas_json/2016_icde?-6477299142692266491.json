{"title": "DebEAQ - debugging empty-answer queries on large data graphs.", "fields": ["data set", "debugging", "pattern matching", "graph database", "algorithmic program debugging"], "abstract": "The large volume of freely available graph data sets impedes the users in analyzing them. For this purpose, they usually pose plenty of pattern matching queries and study their answers. Without deep knowledge about the data graph, users can create \u2018failing\u2019 queries, which deliver empty answers. Analyzing the causes of these empty answers is a time-consuming and complicated task especially for graph queries. To help users in debugging these \u2018failing\u2019 queries, there are two common approaches: one is focusing on discovering missing subgraphs of a data graph, the other one tries to rewrite the queries such that they deliver some results. In this demonstration, we will combine both approaches and give the users an opportunity to discover why empty results were delivered by the requested queries. Therefore, we propose DebEAQ, a debugging tool for pattern matching queries, which allows to compare both approaches and also provides functionality to debug queries manually.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "SAP SE, Walldor ... , 69190 Germany", "SAP SE, Walldor ... , 69190 Germany"], "authors": ["Elena Vasilyeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasilyeva:Elena", "Thomas Heinze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinze_0001:Thomas", "Maik Thiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thiele:Maik", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
