A robot can replace a human in capturing quality photographs for publishing. In this paper, we employ an iterative photo capture by robots (by repositioning itself) to capture good quality photographs. Our image quality assessment approach is based on few high level features of the image combined with some of the aesthetic guidelines of professional photography. Our system can also be used in web image search applications to rank images. We test our quality assessment approach on a large and diversified dataset and our system is able to achieve a classification accuracy of 79%. We assess the aesthetic error in the captured image and estimate the change required in orientation of the robot to retake an aesthetically better photograph. Our experiments are conducted on NAO robot with no stereo vision. The results demonstrate that our system can be used to capture professional photographs which are in accord with the human professional photography.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Raghudeep Gadde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gadde:Raghudeep", "Kamalakar Karlapalem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karlapalem:Kamalakar"], "pages": 6}
