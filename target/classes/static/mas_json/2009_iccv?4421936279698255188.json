Our objective is to start a discovery on how to schedule bottom-up and top-down processes. (1) We identify two bottom-up processes and one top-down process in hierarchical models, termed \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 channels respectively ; (2) We formulate the three channels under an unified Bayesian framework; (3) We use a blocking control strategy to isolate the three channels to separately train them and individually measure their information contributions in typical recognition tasks; (4) Based on the evaluated results, we integrate the three channels to detect objects with performance improvements obtained. Our experiments are performed in both low-middle level tasks, such as detecting edges/bars and junctions, and high level tasks, such as detecting human faces and cars, together with a group of human study designed to compare computer and human perception.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Xiong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiong", "Tianfu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Tianfu", "Song Chun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Song_Chun"], "pages": 8}
