{"title": "The geometry of concurrent interaction: Handling multiple ports by way of multiple tokens.", "fields": ["combinatory logic", "traverse", "security token", "geometry of interaction", "soundness"], "abstract": "We introduce a geometry of interaction model for Mazza's multiport interaction combinators, a graph-theoretic formalism which is able to faithfully capture concurrent computation as embodied by process algebras like the \u03c0-calculus. The introduced model is based on token machines in which not one but multiple tokens are allowed to traverse the underlying net at the same time. We prove soundness and adequacy of the introduced model. The former is proved as a simulation result between the token machines one obtains along any reduction sequence. The latter is obtained by a fine analysis of convergence, both in nets and in token machines.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Bologna", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Ugo Dal Lago.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lago:Ugo_Dal", "Ryo Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Ryo", "Akira Yoshimizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshimizu:Akira"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
