{"title": "Clustered Model Adaption for Personalized Sentiment Analysis.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "exploit", "dirichlet process", "classifier", "multi task learning"], "abstract": "We propose to capture humans' variable and idiosyncratic sentiment via building personalized sentiment classification models at a group level. Our solution roots in the social comparison theory that humans tend to form groups with others of similar minds and ability, and the cognitive consistency theory that mutual influence inside groups will eventually shape group norms and attitudes, with which group members will all shift to align. We formalize personalized sentiment classification as a multi-task learning problem. In particular, to exploit the clustering property of users' opinions, we impose a non-parametric Dirichlet Process prior over the personalized models, in which group members share the same customized sentiment model adapted from a global classifier. Extensive experimental evaluations on large collections of Amazon and Yelp reviews confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution: it outperformed user-independent classification solutions, and several state-of-the-art model adaptation and multi-task learning algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Lin Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Lin", "Benjamin Haines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haines:Benjamin", "Hongning Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hongning"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
