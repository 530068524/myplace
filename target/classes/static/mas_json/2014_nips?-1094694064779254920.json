However, the assumption of a fixed hierarchy is often overly restrictive when working with data generated over a period of time: We expect both the structure of our hierarchy, and the parameters of the clusters, to evolve with time. In this paper, we present a distribution over collections of time-dependent, infinite-dimensional trees that can be used to model evolving hierarchies, and present an efficient and scalable algorithm for performing approximate inference in such a model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model and inference algorithm on both synthetic data and real-world document corpora.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "University of Texas at Austin", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kumar Avinava Dubey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dubey:Kumar_Avinava", "Qirong Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Qirong", "Sinead A.
