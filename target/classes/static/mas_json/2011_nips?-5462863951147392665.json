{"title": "Solving Decision Problems with Limited Information.", "fields": ["forgetting", "machine learning", "influence diagram", "decision problem", "variable elimination"], "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for exactly solving decision-making problems represented as an influence diagram. We do not require the usual assumptions of no forgetting and regularity, which allows us to solve problems with limited information. The algorithm, which implements a sophisticated variable elimination procedure, is empirically shown to outperform a state-of-the-art algorithm in randomly generated problems of up to 150 variables and 1064 strategies.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research"], "authors": ["Denis Deratani Mau\u00e1.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mau=aacute=:Denis_Deratani", "Cassio Polpo de Campos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Campos:Cassio_Polpo_de"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
