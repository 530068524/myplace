We give the first super-quadratic separation between quantum and randomized communication complexity for a total function, giving an example exhibiting a power 2.5 gap. We further present a 1.5 power separation between exact quantum and randomized communication complexity, improving on the previous \u2245 1.15 separation by Ambainis (STOC 2013). Finally, we present a nearly optimal quadratic separation between randomized communication complexity and the logarithm of the partition number, improving upon the previous best power 1.5 separation due to Goos, Jayram, Pitassi, and Watson. Our results are the communication analogues of separations in query complexity proved using the recent cheat sheet framework of Aaronson, Ben-David, and Kothari (STOC 2016). Our main technical results are randomized communication and information complexity lower bounds for a family of functions, called lookup functions, that generalize and port the cheat sheet framework to communication complexity.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Toronto", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Anurag Anshu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anshu:Anurag", "Aleksandrs Belovs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belovs:Aleksandrs", "Shalev Ben-David.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=David:Shalev", "Mika G\u00f6\u00f6s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml==ouml=s:Mika", "Rahul Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0001:Rahul", "Robin Kothari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kothari:Robin", "Troy Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Troy", "Miklos Santha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santha:Miklos"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
