{"title": "Stream-Dataflow Acceleration.", "fields": ["dataflow", "microarchitecture", "reuse", "big data", "simd"], "abstract": "Demand for low-power data processing hardware continues to rise inexorably. Existing programmable and \"general purpose\" solutions (eg. SIMD, GPGPUs) are insufficient, as evidenced by the order-of-magnitude improvements and industry adoption of application and domain-specific accelerators in important areas like machine learning, computer vision and big data. The stark tradeoffs between efficiency and generality at these two extremes poses a difficult question: how could domain-specific hardware efficiency be achieved without domain-specific hardware solutions?   In this work, we rely on the insight that \"acceleratable\" algorithms have broad common properties: high computational intensity with long phases, simple control patterns and dependences, and simple streaming memory access and reuse patterns. We define a general architecture (a hardware-software interface) which can more efficiently expresses program with these properties called stream-dataflow. The dataflow component of this architecture enables high concurrency, and the stream component enables communication and coordination at very-low power and area overhead. This paper explores the hardware and software implications, describes its detailed microarchitecture, and evaluates an implementation. Compared to a state-of-the-art domain specific accelerator (DianNao), and fixed-function accelerators for MachSuite, Softbrain can match their performance with only 2x power overhead on average.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Tony Nowatzki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nowatzki:Tony", "Vinay Gangadhar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gangadhar:Vinay", "Newsha Ardalani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ardalani:Newsha", "Karthikeyan Sankaralingam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankaralingam:Karthikeyan"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
