Let o n  denote its critical transmission radius for its greedy forward routing. Recently, asymptotic bounds on o n  have been progressively improved. However, the precise asymptotic probability distribution of o n  remains open. In this paper, we settle this open problem. Specifically, let \u03c3 = 2\u03c0 over 3 \u2212 \u221a3 over 2. Then for any constant c, the asymptotic probability of equation is proved to be exactly exp (equation).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Paine College"], "authors": ["Peng-Jun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Peng=Jun", "Lixin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lixin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
