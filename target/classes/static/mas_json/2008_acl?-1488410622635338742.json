By testing a state\u2013of\u2013the\u2013art SRL system with the two alternative role annotations, we show that the PropBank role set is more robust to the lack of verb\u2013specific semantic information and generalizes better to infrequent and unseen predicates. Keeping in mind that thematic roles are better for application needs, we also tested the best way to generate VerbNet annotation. We conclude that tagging first PropBank roles and mapping into VerbNet roles is as effective as training and tagging directly on VerbNet, and more robust for domain shifts.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of the Basque Country", "University of the Basque Country", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Be\u00f1at Zapirain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zapirain:Be=ntilde=at", "Eneko Agirre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agirre:Eneko", "Llu\u00eds M\u00e0rquez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=agrave=rquez:Llu=iacute=s"], "pages": 9}
