From a web-scale corpus of English news, we mine syntactic patterns that a Noisy-OR model generalizes into event descriptions. At inference time, we query the model with the patterns observed in an unseen news collection, identify the event that better captures the gist of the collection and retrieve the most appropriate pattern to generate a headline. HEADY improves over a state-of-theart open-domain title abstraction method, bridging half of the gap that separates it from extractive methods using humangenerated titles in manual evaluations, and performs comparably to human-generated headlines as evaluated with ROUGE.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "National University of Distance Education"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Enrique Alfonseca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alfonseca:Enrique", "Daniele Pighin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pighin:Daniele", "Guillermo Garrido.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garrido:Guillermo"], "pages": 11}
