We address the problem of identifying, within a given set of lotteries, a (near-)optimal solution for a given decision maker consistent with the WEU theory. The WEU model is parameterized by two real-valued functions. We propose here a new incremental elicitation procedure to progressively reduce the imprecision about these functions until a robust decision can be made. We also give experimental results showing the practical efficiency of our method.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University", "Aalborg University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Hugo Gilbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilbert:Hugo", "Nawal Benabbou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benabbou:Nawal", "Patrice Perny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perny:Patrice", "Olivier Spanjaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spanjaard:Olivier", "Paolo Viappiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viappiani:Paolo"], "pages": 7}
