For example, MARIO [1], a mid-air display, can form an image in the depth range of 30 cm by physically moving the light source display. Multi-layered mid-air images can be displayed at various depths, but such multi-layered images are transparent and experience color mixture due to the addition of light from the light source displays. It is difficult to see the front of transparent images because they have no occlusion expression.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Hajime Kajita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kajita:Hajime", "Naoya Koizumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koizumi:Naoya", "Takeshi Naemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naemura:Takeshi"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
