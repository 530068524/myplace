These models can represent arbitrary distributions over binary variables, and thus generalize the commonly used pairwise Markov random fields and models with log-supermodular potentials only, for which efficient approximate inference algorithms are known. While inference in the considered models is #P-hard in general, we present efficient approximate algorithms exploiting recent advances in the field of discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a large set of experiments, where our model allows reasoning about preferences over sets of items with complements and substitutes.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Josip Djolonga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Djolonga:Josip", "Sebastian Tschiatschek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tschiatschek:Sebastian", "Andreas Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause_0001:Andreas"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
