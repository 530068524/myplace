{"title": "Width and Complexity of Belief Tracking in Non-Deterministic Conformant and Contingent Planning.", "fields": ["bounded function", "mathematical optimization", "nondeterministic algorithm", "computer science", "exponential function"], "abstract": "It has been shown recently that the complexity of belief tracking in deterministic conformant and contingent planning is exponential in a width parameter that is often bounded and small. In this work, we introduce a new width notion that applies to non-deterministic conformant and contingent problems as well. We also develop a belief tracking algorithm for nondeterministic problems that is exponential in the problem width, analyze the width of non-deterministic benchmarks, compare the new notion to the previous one over deterministic problems, and present experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University", "Pompeu Fabra University"], "authors": ["Blai Bonet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonet:Blai", "Hector Geffner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geffner:Hector"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
