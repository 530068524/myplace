Similarity join is a fundamental operation across scientific workloads that requires complex processing over an unbounded number of pairs of multi-dimensional points. In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed similarity join operator for multi-dimensional arrays. Unlike immediate extensions to array join and relational similarity join, the proposed operator minimizes the overall data transfer and network congestion while providing load-balancing, without completely repartitioning and replicating the input arrays. We define formally array similarity join and present the design, optimization strategies, and evaluation of the first array similarity join operator.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Merced", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Weijie Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Weijie", "Florin Rusu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rusu:Florin", "Bin Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Bin", "Kesheng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Kesheng"], "pages": 16}
