{"title": "CompoundEyes: Near-duplicate detection in large scale online video systems in the cloud.", "fields": ["cloud computing", "video post processing", "simple features", "curse of dimensionality", "video tracking"], "abstract": "At the present time, billions of videos are hosted and shared in the cloud of which a sizable portion consists of near-duplicate video copies. An efficient and accurate content-based online near-duplicate video detection method is a fundamental research goal; as it would benefit applications such as duplication-aware storage, pirate video detection, polluted video tag detection, searching result diversification. Despite the recent progress made in near-duplicate video detection, it remains challenging to develop a practical detection system for large-scale applications that has good efficiency and accuracy performance. In this paper, we shift the focus from feature representation design to system design, and develop a novel system, called CompoundEyes, accordingly. The improvement in accuracy is achieved via well-organized classifiers instead of advanced feature design. Meanwhile, by applying simple features with reduced dimensionality and exploiting the parallelism of the detection architecture, we accelerate the detection speed. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that the proposed detection system is accurate and fast. It takes approximately 1.45 seconds to process a video clip from a large video dataset, CC_WEB_VIDEO, with a 89% detection accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Yixin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yixin", "Wenbo He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Wenbo", "Yu Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua_0001:Yu", "Wen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wen"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
