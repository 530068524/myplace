In this paper, we theoretically investigate the influence of non-identifiability on Bayesian matrix factorization. More specifically, we show that a variational Bayesian method involves regularization effect even when the prior is non-informative, which is intrinsically different from the maximum a posteriori approach. We also extend our analysis to empirical Bayes scenarios where hyperparameters are also learned from data.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Nikon", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Shinichi Nakajima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakajima:Shinichi", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
