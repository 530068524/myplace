{"title": "On the Power Laws of Language: Word Frequency Distributions.", "fields": ["line", "zipf s law", "phenomenon", "smoothness", "generative model"], "abstract": "About eight decades ago, Zipf postulated that the word frequency distribution of languages is a  power law , i.e., it is a straight line on a log-log plot. Over the years, this phenomenon has been documented and studied extensively. For many corpora, however, the empirical distribution barely resembles a power law: when plotted on a log-log scale, the distribution is concave and appears to be composed of two differently sloped straight lines joined by a smooth curve. A simple generative model is proposed to capture this phenomenon. The word frequency distributions produced by this model are shown to match the observations both analytically and empirically.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Flavio Chierichetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chierichetti:Flavio", "Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Ravi", "Bo Pang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pang:Bo"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
