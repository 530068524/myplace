{"title": "SCCharts: sequentially constructive statecharts for safety-critical applications: HW/SW-synthesis for a conservative extension of synchronous statecharts.", "fields": ["fork", "state diagram", "conservative extension", "life critical system", "model of computation"], "abstract": "We present a new visual language,  SCCharts , designed for specifying safety-critical reactive systems. SCCharts use a statechart notation and provide determinate concurrency based on a synchronous model of computation (MoC), without restrictions common to previous synchronous MoCs. Specifically, we lift earlier limitations on sequential accesses to shared variables, by leveraging the sequentially constructive MoC. The semantics and key features of SCCharts are defined by a very small set of elements, the  Core SCCharts , consisting of state machines plus fork/join concurrency. We also present a compilation chain that allows efficient synthesis of software and hardware.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of Kiel", "University of Kiel", "University of Kiel", "University of Kiel", "University of Bamberg"], "authors": ["Reinhard von Hanxleden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanxleden:Reinhard_von", "Bj\u00f6rn Duderstadt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duderstadt:Bj=ouml=rn", "Christian Motika.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Motika:Christian", "Steven Smyth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smyth:Steven", "Michael Mendler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mendler:Michael", "Joaqu\u00edn Aguado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aguado:Joaqu=iacute=n", "Stephen Mercer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mercer:Stephen", "Owen O'Brien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Brien:Owen"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
