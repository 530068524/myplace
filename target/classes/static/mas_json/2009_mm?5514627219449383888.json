Context-based music recommendation requires multidisciplinary efforts including low level feature extraction, music mood classification and human emotion prediction. Especially, in this paper, we focus on the implementation issues of context-based mood classification and music recommendation. For mood classification, we reformulate it into a regression problem based on support vector regression (SVR). Through the use of the SVR-based mood classifier, we achieved 87.8% accuracy. For music recommendation, we reason about the user's mood and situation using both collaborative filtering and ontology technology. We implement a prototype music recommendation system based on this scheme and report some of the results that we obtained.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Korea University", "Korea University"], "authors": ["Seungmin Rho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rho:Seungmin", "Byeong-jun Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Byeong=jun", "Eenjun Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Eenjun"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
