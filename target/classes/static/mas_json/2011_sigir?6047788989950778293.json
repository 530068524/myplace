While this information can prove crucial to understanding news stories and how events will develop for a given topic, there is currently no easy way to access this information. We propose a new task to address the problem of retrieving and ranking sentences that contain mentions to future events, which we call ranking related news predictions. In this paper, we formally define this task and propose a learning to rank approach based on 4 classes of features: term similarity, entity-based similarity, topic similarity, and temporal similarity. Through extensive evaluations using a corpus consisting of 1.8 millions news articles and 6,000 manually judged relevance pairs, we show that our approach is able to retrieve a significant number of relevant predictions related to a given topic.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Nattiya Kanhabua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanhabua:Nattiya", "Roi Blanco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanco:Roi", "Michael Matthews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthews:Michael"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
