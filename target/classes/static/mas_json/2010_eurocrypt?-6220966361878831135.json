Security is based on the hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) problem, which is known to be as hard as certain worst-case lattice problems.\n\nSome features of our cryptosystem include support for large message space, an easy way of achieving formula-privacy, a better message-to-ciphertext expansion ratio than BGN, and an easy way of multiplying two encrypted polynomials. Also, the scheme can be made identity-based and leakage-resilient (at the cost of a higher message-to-ciphertext expansion ratio).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Craig Gentry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentry:Craig", "Shai Halevi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halevi:Shai", "Vinod Vaikuntanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaikuntanathan:Vinod"], "pages": 17}
