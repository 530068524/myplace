Previous work mostly focused on tactile actuators that stimulate only specific skin receptors on the finger, resulting in limited information expressiveness. We propose tactoRing, a novel tactile display that, by dragging a small tactor on the skin around the finger, excites multiple skin areas resulting in more accurate cue recognition. In this paper, we present the hardware and a perception study to understand the ability of users to recognize eight distinct points around the finger. Moreover, we show two different techniques to encode information through skin-dragging motion with accuracy up to 94%. We finally showcase a set of applications that, by combining sequences of tactile stimuli, achieve higher expressiveness than prior methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "National Chiao Tung University", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Seungwoo Je.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Je:Seungwoo", "Brendan Rooney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rooney:Brendan", "Liwei Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Liwei", "Andrea Bianchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bianchi:Andrea"], "pages": 9}
