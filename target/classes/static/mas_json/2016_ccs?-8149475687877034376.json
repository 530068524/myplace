{"title": "Accessorize to a Crime: Real and Stealthy Attacks on State-of-the-Art Face Recognition.", "fields": ["face detection", "physical security", "biometrics", "adversarial machine learning", "access control"], "abstract": "Machine learning is enabling a myriad innovations, including new algorithms for cancer diagnosis and self-driving cars. The broad use of machine learning makes it important to understand the extent to which machine-learning algorithms are subject to attack, particularly when used in applications where physical security or safety is at risk.   In this paper, we focus on facial biometric systems, which are widely used in surveillance and access control. We define and investigate a novel class of attacks: attacks that are physically realizable and inconspicuous, and allow an attacker to evade recognition or impersonate another individual. We develop a systematic method to automatically generate such attacks, which are realized through printing a pair of eyeglass frames. When worn by the attacker whose image is supplied to a state-of-the-art face-recognition algorithm, the eyeglasses allow her to evade being recognized or to impersonate another individual. Our investigation focuses on white-box face-recognition systems, but we also demonstrate how similar techniques can be used in black-box scenarios, as well as to avoid face detection.", "citation": "Citations (152)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Mahmood Sharif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharif:Mahmood", "Sruti Bhagavatula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhagavatula:Sruti", "Lujo Bauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauer:Lujo", "Michael K.
