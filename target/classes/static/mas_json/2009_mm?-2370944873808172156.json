{"title": "Improving automatic music tag annotation using stacked generalization of probabilistic SVM outputs.", "fields": ["music information retrieval", "recommender system", "content analysis", "probabilistic logic", "annotation"], "abstract": "Music listeners frequently use words to describe music. Personalized music recommendation systems such as Last.fm and Pandora rely on manual annotations (tags) as a mechanism for querying and navigating large music collections. A well-known issue in such recommendation systems is known as the cold-start problem: it is not possible to recommend new songs/tracks until those songs/tracks have been manually annotated. Automatic tag annotation based on content analysis is a potential solution to this problem and has recently been gaining attention. We describe how stacked generalization can be used to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art automatic tag annotation system for music based on audio content analysis and report results on two publicly available datasets.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "departments": ["University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "Research Center ...
