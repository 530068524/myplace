The QMDP-net combines the strengths of model-free learning and model-based planning. It is a recurrent policy network, but it represents a policy for a parameterized set of tasks by connecting a model with a planning algorithm that solves the model, thus embedding the solution structure of planning in a network learning architecture. The QMDP-net is fully differentiable and allows for end-to-end training. We train a QMDP-net on different tasks so that it can generalize to new ones in the parameterized task set and \u201ctransfer\u201d to other similar tasks beyond the set. In preliminary experiments, QMDP-net showed strong performance on several robotic tasks in simulation. Interestingly, while QMDP-net encodes the QMDP algorithm, it sometimes outperforms the QMDP algorithm in the experiments, as a result of end-to-end learning.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["P\u00e9ter Karkus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karkus:P=eacute=ter", "David Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:David", "Wee Sun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wee_Sun"], "pages": 11}
