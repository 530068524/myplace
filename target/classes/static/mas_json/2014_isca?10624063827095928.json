It starts with an in-depth explanation of the background and standardization process before moving on to examine the system architecture evolution (SAE). The basics of air interface modulation choices are introduced and key subjects such as 3GPP LTE physical layer and protocol solutions are described. Mobility aspects and radio resource management together with radio and end-to-end performance are assessed. The voice solution and voice capacity in LTE are also illustrated. Finally, the main differences between LTE TDD and FDD modes are examined and HSPA evolution in 3GPP Releases 7 and 8 is described. LTE for UMTS is one of the first books to provide a comprehensive guide to the standards and technologies of LTE. Key features of the book include: Covers all the key aspects of LTE in a systematic manner Presents full description of 3GPP Release 8 LTE Examines the expected performance of LTE Written by experts actively involved in the 3GPP standards and product development.", "citation": "Citations (1,283)", "departments": ["University of Western Ontario", "University of Western Ontario", "University of South Australia", "University of South Australia", "University of California, Berkeley", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "University of California, Berkeley", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "G.
