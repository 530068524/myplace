It developed a reputation for providing first-rate coverage of foreign news, with France receiving its due share of space according to the course of events taking place across the Channel. This paper examines how France and the French were depicted by Mercurius Politicus contributors during the Fronde, which more or less coincided with the time of the Commonwealth. It also considers how the authors viewed the English revolution and the establishment of the Commonwealth with regard to the rebellion in France. It finally explains why the journalists\u2019 attention was especially drawn to Bordeaux, where a more radical Fronde was taking place.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Federal University of Paran\u00e1", "Federal University of Paran\u00e1", "Federal University of Paran\u00e1", "Federal University of Paran\u00e1", "Federal University of Paran\u00e1", "Federal University of Pernambuco", "Guru Nanak Dev University", "Guru Nanak Dev University", "Guru Nanak Dev University", "Guru Nanak Dev University", "U.O.C. di Chiru ... 26 Turin, Italy", "U.O.C. di Chiru ... i\u201d, Rome, Italy", "U.O.C. di Chiru ... 26 Turin, Italy", "S.S.Dip. di Chi ... \u201d, Turin, Italy", "U.O.C. di Chiru ... 26 Turin, Italy", "Department of T ... i, UFPE, Brazil", "Microbiology Di ... i, UFPE, Brazil", "Microbiology Di ... i, UFPE, Brazil", "Microbiology Di ... i, UFPE, Brazil"], "authors": ["Bret Battey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Battey:Bret"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
