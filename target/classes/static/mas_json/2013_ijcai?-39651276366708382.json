Although a lot of DNA methods have been proposed by researchers from different communities, most of them can only model snapshot data recorded at a very rough temporal granularity. Recently, some models have been proposed for DNA which can be used to model large-scale citation networks at a fine temporal granularity. However, they suffer from a significant decrease of accuracy over time because the learned parameters or node features are static (fixed) during the prediction process for evolving citation networks. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called online egocentric model (OEM), to learn time-varying parameters and node features for evolving citation networks. Experimental results on real-world citation networks show that our OEM can not only prevent the prediction accuracy from decreasing over time but also uncover the evolution of topics in citation networks.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Hao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0014:Hao", "Wu-Jun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wu=Jun"], "pages": 7}
