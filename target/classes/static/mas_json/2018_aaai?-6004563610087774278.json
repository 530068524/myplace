In recent years several new systems that try to solve at least one of the two sub-tasks (text detection and text recognition) have been proposed. In this paper we present SEE, a step towards semi-supervised neural networks for scene text detection and recognition, that can be optimized end-to-end. Most existing works consist of multiple deep neural networks and several pre-processing steps. In contrast to this, we propose to use a single deep neural network, that learns to detect and recognize text from natural images, in a semi-supervised way. SEE is a network that integrates and jointly learns a spatial transformer network, which can learn to detect text regions in an image, and a text recognition network that takes the identified text regions and recognizes their textual content. We introduce the idea behind our novel approach and show its feasibility, by performing a range of experiments on standard benchmark datasets, where we achieve competitive results.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Potsdam", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "authors": ["Christian Bartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartz:Christian", "Haojin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Haojin", "Christoph Meinel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meinel:Christoph"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
