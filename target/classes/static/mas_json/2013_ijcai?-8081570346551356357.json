{"title": "Computing Upper Bounds on Lengths of Transition Sequences.", "fields": ["reachability", "time complexity", "discrete mathematics", "graph", "propositional variable"], "abstract": "We describe an approach to computing upper bounds on the lengths of solutions to reachability problems in transition systems. It is based on a decomposition of state-variable dependency graphs (causal graphs). Our approach is able to find practical upper bounds in a number of planning benchmarks. Computing the bounds is computationally cheap in practice, and in a number of benchmarks our algorithm runs in polynomial time in the number of actions and propositional variables that characterize the problem.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Aalto University", "NICTA"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jussi Rintanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rintanen:Jussi", "Charles Orgill Gretton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gretton:Charles_Orgill"], "pages": 8}
