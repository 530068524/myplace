Based on this study, we then propose dynamic load distribution policies that consider all electricity-related costs as well as transient cooling effects. Our evaluation studies the ability of different cooling strategies to handle load spikes, compares the behaviors of our dynamic cost-aware policies to cost-unaware and static policies, and explores the effects of many parameter settings. Among other interesting results, we demonstrate that (1) our policies can provide large cost savings, (2) load migration enables savings in many scenarios, and (3) all electricity-related costs must be considered at the same time for higher and consistent cost savings.", "citation": "Citations (213)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Kien Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Kien", "Ricardo Bianchini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bianchini:Ricardo", "Jingru Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jingru", "Yogesh Jaluria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaluria:Yogesh", "Jiandong Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Jiandong", "Thu D.
