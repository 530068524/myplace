{"title": "BEAS: Bounded Evaluation of SQL Queries.", "fields": ["data mining", "bounded function", "cardinality", "proof of concept", "sql"], "abstract": "We demonstrate  BEAS , a prototype system for querying relations with bounded resources.  BEAS  advocates an unconventional query evaluation paradigm under an access schema  A , which is a combination of cardinality constraints and associated indices. Given an SQL query  Q  and a dataset  D ,  BEAS  computes  Q ( D ) by accessing a bounded fraction  D   Q   of  D , such that  Q (D  Q  ) =  Q ( D ) and  D   Q   is determined by   A   and  Q  only, no matter how big  D  grows. It identifies  D  Q  by reasoning about the cardinality constraints of   A  , and fetches  D   Q   using the indices of   A  . We demonstrate the feasibility of bounded evaluation by walking through each functional component of  BEAS . As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how  BEAS  conducts CDR analyses in telecommunication industry, compared with commercial database systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "Nanjing University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yang", "Wenfei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Wenfei", "Yanghao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yanghao", "Tengfei Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Tengfei", "Yanchao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yanchao", "Laura Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Laura_Yu"], "pages": 4}
