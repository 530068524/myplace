{"title": "Multi-period Trading Prediction Markets with Connections to Machine Learning.", "fields": ["market maker", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present a new model for prediction markets, in which we use risk measures to model agents and introduce a market maker to describe the trading process. This specific choice of modelling approach enables us to show that the whole market approaches a global objective, despite the fact that the market is designed such that each agent only cares about its own goal. In addition, the market dynamic provides a sensible algorithm for optimising the global objective. An intimate connection between machine learning and our markets is thus established, such that we could 1) analyse a market by applying machine learning methods to the global objective; and 2) solve machine learning problems by setting up and running certain markets.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jinli Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Jinli", "Amos J.
