However, no single fault localization measure completely outperforms others: a measure which is more accurate in localizing some bugs in some programs is less accurate in localizing other bugs in other programs. This paper proposes to compose existing spectrum-based fault localization measures into an improved measure. We model the composition of various measures as an optimization problem and present a search-based approach to explore the space of many possible compositions and output a heuristically near optimal composite measure. We employ two search-based strategies including genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to look for optimal solutions and compare the effectiveness of the resulting composite measures on benchmark software systems. Compared to individual spectrum-based fault localization techniques, our composite measures perform statistically significantly better.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Shaowei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Shaowei", "David Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo_0001:David", "Lingxiao Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Lingxiao", "Lucia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucia:", "Hoong Chuin Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Hoong_Chuin"], "pages": 4}
