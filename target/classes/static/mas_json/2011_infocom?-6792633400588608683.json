Its throughput efficiency ratio was shown to be exactly the local pooling factor (LPF) of the multihop wireless network in a recent seminar work by Joo et al. [5]. Under the 802.11 interference model with uniform interference radii, the LPF of a multihop wireless network was known to be at least 1/6. However, little is known about the LPF of a multihop wireless network under the 802.11 interference model with arbitrary interference radii or under the protocol interference model. In this paper, we derive constant lower bounds on LPFs of these multihop wireless networks. Specifically, under the 802.11 interference model with arbitrary interference radii, the LPF is at least 1/16. Under the protocol interference model, if the communication radius of each node is at most c times its interference radius for some c < 1, then the LPF is at least 1/ (2 \u2308\u03c0/ arcsin 1\u2212c over 2\u2308 \u2212 1)).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "City University of Hong Kong", "Paine College", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Georgetown University"], "authors": ["Peng-Jun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Peng=Jun", "Minming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Minming", "Lixin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lixin", "Zhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhu", "Ophir Frieder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frieder:Ophir"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
