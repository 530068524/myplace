Properly-cut diamond brings about scintillation when viewing angle is changed, because total reflection inside a diamond tends to occur frequently due to the large refractive index. Moreover, strong rainbow colors are seen because of high dispersion ratio.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Kanagawa Institute of Technology", "Kanagawa Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Nahomi Maki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maki:Nahomi", "Kazuhisa Yanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yanaka:Kazuhisa"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
