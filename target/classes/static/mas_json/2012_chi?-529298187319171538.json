{"title": "ZeroTouch: an optical multi-touch and free-air interaction architecture.", "fields": ["multi touch", "simulation", "architecture", "modular design", "modalities"], "abstract": "ZeroTouch (ZT) is a unique optical sensing technique and architecture that allows precision sensing of hands, fingers, and other objects within a constrained 2-dimensional plane. ZeroTouch provides tracking at 80 Hz, and up to 30 concurrent touch points. Integration with LCDs is trivial. While designed for multi-touch sensing, ZT enables other new modalities, such as pen+touch and free-air interaction. In this paper, we contextualize ZT innovations with a review of other flat-panel sensing technologies. We present the modular sensing architecture behind ZT, and examine early diverse uses of ZT sensing.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Jonathan Moeller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moeller:Jonathan", "Andruid Kerne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kerne:Andruid"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
