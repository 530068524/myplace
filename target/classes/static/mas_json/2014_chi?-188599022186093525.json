{"title": "Towards crowd-based customer service: a mixed-initiative tool for managing Q&A sites.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "operator", "precision and recall", "cognitive load", "desk"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a mixed-initiative approach to integrate a Q&A site based on a crowd of volunteers with a standard operator-based help desk, ensuring quality of customer service. Q&A sites have emerged as an efficient way to address questions in various domains by leveraging crowd knowledge. However, they lack sufficient reliability to be the sole basis of customer service applications. We built a proof-of-concept mixed-initiative tool that helps a crowd-manager to decide if a question will get a satisfactory and timely answer by the crowd or if it should be redirected to a dedicated operator. A user experiment found that our tool reduced the participants' cognitive load and improved their performance, in terms of their precision and recall. In particular, those with higher performance benefited more than those with lower performance.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Xerox", "Xerox", "Amazon.com", "Informatica Cor ... d City, CA, USA", "FBK, Trento, Italy"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tiziano Piccardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piccardi:Tiziano", "Gregorio Convertino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Convertino:Gregorio", "Massimo Zancanaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zancanaro:Massimo", "Ji Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ji", "C\u00e9dric Archambeau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Archambeau:C=eacute=dric"], "pages": 10}
