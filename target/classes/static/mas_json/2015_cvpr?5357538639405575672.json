{"title": "Making better use of edges via perceptual grouping.", "fields": ["learning to rank", "sketch", "edge detection", "graph partition", "gestalt psychology"], "abstract": "We propose a perceptual grouping framework that organizes image edges into meaningful structures and demonstrate its usefulness on various computer vision tasks. Our grouper formulates edge grouping as a graph partition problem, where a learning to rank method is developed to encode probabilities of candidate edge pairs. In particular, RankSVM is employed for the first time to combine multiple Gestalt principles as cue for edge grouping. Afterwards, an edge grouping based object proposal measure is introduced that yields proposals comparable to state-of-the-art alternatives. We further show how human-like sketches can be generated from edge groupings and consequently used to deliver state-of-the-art sketch-based image retrieval performance. Last but not least, we tackle the problem of freehand human sketch segmentation by utilizing the proposed grouper to cluster strokes into semantic object parts.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yonggang Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Yonggang", "Yi-Zhe Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yi=Zhe", "Tao Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Tao", "Honggang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Honggang", "Timothy M.
