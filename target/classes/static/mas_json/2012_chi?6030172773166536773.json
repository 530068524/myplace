It provides a continuous, supplemental input stream to an interactive human-robot system, which uses this information to modify its behavior to better support multitasking. This paper demonstrates that we can use non-invasive methods to detect signals coming from the brain that users naturally and effortlessly generate while using a computer system. If used with care, this additional information can lead to systems that respond appropriately to changes in the user's state. Our experimental study shows that Brainput significantly improves several performance metrics, as well as the subjective NASA-Task Load Index scores in a dual-task human-robot activity.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Tufts University", "Tufts University", "Tufts University"], "authors": ["Erin Treacy Solovey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solovey:Erin_Treacy", "Paul W.
