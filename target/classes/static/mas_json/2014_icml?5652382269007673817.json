In this paper, we present lower bounds for the mixing time of the Gibbs sampler over Gaussian mixture models with Dirichlet priors.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Christopher Tosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tosh:Christopher", "Sanjoy Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Sanjoy"], "pages": 9}
