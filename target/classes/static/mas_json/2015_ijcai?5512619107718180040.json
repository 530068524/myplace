In this paper, we develop an AI-aided art authoring (A4) system of non-photorealistic rendering that allows users to automatically generate brush stroke paintings in a specific artist's style. Within the reinforcement learning framework of brush stroke generation proposed by Xie et al. [Xie et al., 2012], our contribution in this paper is to learn artists' drawing styles from video-captured stroke data by inverse reinforcement learning. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our system can successfully learn artists' styles and render pictures with consistent and smooth brush strokes.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tongji University", "Tianjin University of Science and Technology", "Bournemouth University", "Hiroshima Institute of Technology", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Ning Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0003:Ning", "Tingting Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Tingting", "Feng Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Feng", "Xiaohua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiaohua", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
