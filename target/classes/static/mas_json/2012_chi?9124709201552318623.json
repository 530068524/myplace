The emergence of Cloud computing has enabled people to move their personal files to online places, and create new digital things through online services. However, little is known about how this shift might shape people's orientations toward their digital things.

Findings are interpreted to detail design and research opportunities in this emerging space.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["William Odom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Odom:William", "Abigail Sellen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sellen:Abigail", "Richard H.
