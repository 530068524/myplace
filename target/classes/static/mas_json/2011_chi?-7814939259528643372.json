The model provides a good fit (R 2 =0.88) with laboratory data, but it is not known if it generalizes to real-world AR tasks. In the present outdoor study, subjects (N=12) did building-selection tasks in an urban area. The differences in task characteristics to the laboratory study are drastic: targets are three-dimensional and they vary in shape, size, z-distance, and visual context. Nevertheless, the model yielded an R 2  of 0.80, and when using effective target width an R 2  of 0.88 was achieved.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Michael Rohs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rohs:Michael", "Antti Oulasvirta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oulasvirta:Antti", "Tiia Suomalainen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suomalainen:Tiia"], "pages": 4}
