We observe that many applications today require parallel (interleaving) event patterns. Moreover, we observe that this matching needs to be approximate in terms of event orders and missing events. We first propose the query semantics. Then we devise a foundation algorithm, on top of which two optimization techniques are proposed. Finally, we perform a comprehensive experimental evaluation using three real-world datasets in different domains and synthetic datasets.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Lowell", "University of Massachusetts Lowell"], "authors": ["Zheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zheng", "Tingjian Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Tingjian"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
