A prevalent assumption in constructing matrix approximations is that the partially observed matrix is of low-rank. We propose a new matrix approximation model where we assume instead that the matrix is locally of low-rank, leading to a representation of the observed matrix as a weighted sum of low-rank matrices. We analyze the accuracy of the proposed local low-rank modeling. Our experiments show improvements in prediction accuracy over classical approaches for recommendation tasks.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Google"], "authors": ["Joonseok Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joonseok", "Seungyeon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seungyeon", "Guy Lebanon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lebanon:Guy", "Yoram Singer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singer:Yoram"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
