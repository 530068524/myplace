{"title": "MixT: a language for mixing consistency in geodistributed transactions.", "fields": ["serialization", "consistency model", "high availability", "weak consistency", "strong consistency"], "abstract": "Programming concurrent, distributed systems is hard\u2014especially when these systems mutate shared, persistent state replicated at geographic scale. To enable high availability and scalability, a new class of weakly consistent data stores has become popular. However, some data needs strong consistency. To manipulate both weakly and strongly consistent data in a single transaction, we introduce a new abstraction: mixed-consistency transactions, embodied in a new embedded language, MixT. Programmers explicitly associate consistency models with remote storage sites; each atomic, isolated transaction can access a mixture of data with different consistency models. Compile-time information-flow checking, applied to consistency models, ensures that these models are mixed safely and enables the compiler to automatically partition transactions. New run-time mechanisms ensure that consistency models can also be mixed safely, even when the data used by a transaction resides on separate, mutually unaware stores. Performance measurements show that despite their stronger guarantees, mixed-consistency transactions retain much of the speed of weak consistency, significantly outperforming traditional serializable transactions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Matthew Milano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milano:Matthew", "Andrew C.
