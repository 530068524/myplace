{"title": "MySong: automatic accompaniment generation for vocal melodies.", "fields": ["music theory", "melody", "chord", "singing", "microphone"], "abstract": "We introduce MySong, a system that automatically chooses chords to accompany a vocal melody. A user with no musical experience can create a song with instrumental accompaniment just by singing into a microphone, and can experiment with different styles and chord patterns using interactions designed to be intuitive to non-musicians.   We describe the implementation of MySong, which trains a Hidden Markov Model using a music database and uses that model to select chords for new melodies. Model parameters are intuitively exposed to the user. We present results from a study demonstrating that chords assigned to melodies using MySong and chords assigned manually by musicians receive similar subjective ratings. We then present results from a second study showing that thirteen users with no background in music theory are able to rapidly create musical accompaniments using MySong, and that these accompaniments are rated positively by evaluators.", "citation": "Citations (157)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ian Simon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simon:Ian", "Dan Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Dan", "Sumit Basu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basu:Sumit"], "pages": 10}
