Such diffusion processes have already proved the ability to significantly improve subsequent applications like retrieval. We give a thorough overview of the state-of-the-art in this field and discuss obvious similarities and differences. Based on our observations, we are then able to derive a generic framework for diffusion processes in the scope of retrieval applications, where the related work represents specific instances of our generic formulation. We evaluate our framework on several retrieval tasks and are able to derive algorithms that e.\\, g.~achieve a 100\\% bulls eye score on the popular MPEG7 shape retrieval data set.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Institute of Co ... d Vision (7100)", "Institute of Co ... d Vision (7100)"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michael Donoser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Donoser:Michael", "Horst Bischof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischof:Horst"], "pages": 8}
