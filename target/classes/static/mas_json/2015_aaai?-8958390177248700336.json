This position assignment tool was first developed in 2012 and has been used successfully since then. The tool has since evolved for use with several other position assignment and related tasks with other similar programs in Ford Motor Company. This paper will describe the creation of this tool and how we have applied it, focusing on the need for developing such a tool, and how the continued development of this tool will benefit its users and the company.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ford Motor Company", "Ford Motor Company"], "authors": ["Leonard Kinnaird-Heether.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kinnaird=Heether:Leonard", "Chris Dorman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dorman:Chris"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
