{"title": "OTrack: Order tracking for luggage in mobile RFID systems.", "fields": ["signal strength", "mobile rfid", "order tracking", "radio propagation", "phenomenon"], "abstract": "In many logistics applications of RFID technology, goods attached with tags are placed on moving conveyor belts for processing. It is important to figure out the order of goods on the belts so that further actions like sorting can be accurately taken on proper goods. Due to arbitrary goods placement or the irregularity of wireless signal propagation, neither of the order of tag identification nor the received signal strength provides sufficient evidence on their relative positions on the belts. In this study, we observe, from experiments, a critical region of reading rate when a tag gets close enough to a reader. This phenomenon, as well as other signal attributes, yields the stable indication of tag order. We establish a probabilistic model for recognizing the transient critical region and propose the OTrack protocol to continuously monitor the order of tags. To validate the protocol, we evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness through a one-month experiment conducted through a working conveyor at Beijing Capital International Airport.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Nanyang Technological University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Longfei Shangguan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shangguan:Longfei", "Zhenjiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhenjiang", "Zheng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Zheng", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
