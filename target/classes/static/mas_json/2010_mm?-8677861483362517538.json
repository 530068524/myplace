Based on reproductions of Rothko's \"Red on Maroon\" found on the Internet, and using computer graphics compositing associated with moire and specular lighting effects, \"Encounter (Resonances)\" offers a new approach to the presentation of a piece of work that allows a viewer to perceive some of its very subtle nuances. The work echoes Rothko's mixed media layered painting technique by using reproductions of various color palettes and resolutions as metaphors for the layers of paint in his original works. While each of these copies may instantly remind us of the original work, the graphical rendering of \"Encounter (Resonances)\" combines them at three levels of representation (global shape, micro and macro structure), in an effort to encourage a level of prolonged engagement and gradual discovery in the artwork.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Paris"], "authors": ["Hayley Hung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hung:Hayley", "Christian Jacquemin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacquemin:Christian"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
