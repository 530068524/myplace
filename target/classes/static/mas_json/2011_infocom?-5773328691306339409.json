{"title": "Opportunistic spectrum access for mobile cognitive radios.", "fields": ["spectrum management", "cognitive radio", "mobile radio", "guard", "mobile device"], "abstract": "Cognitive radios (CRs) can mitigate the impending spectrum scarcity problem by utilizing their capability of accessing licensed spectrum bands opportunistically. While most existing work focuses on enabling such opportunistic spectrum access for stationary CRs, mobility is an important concern to secondary users (SUs) because future mobile devices are expected to incorporate CR functionality. In this paper, we identify and address three fundamental challenges encountered specifically by mobile SUs. First, we model channel availability experienced by a mobile SU as a two-state continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) and verify its accuracy via in-depth simulation. Then, to protect primary/incumbent communications from SU interference, we introduce guard distance in the space domain and derive the optimal guard distance that maximizes the spatio-temporal spectrum opportunities available to mobile CRs. To facilitate efficient spectrum sharing, we formulate the problem of maximizing secondary network throughput within a convex optimization framework, and derive an optimal, distributed channel selection strategy. Our simulation results show that the proposed spectrum sensing and distributed channel access schemes improve network throughput and fairness significantly, and reduce SU energy consumption for spectrum sensing by up to 74%.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Deutsche Telekom", "Deutsche Telekom", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Alexander W.
