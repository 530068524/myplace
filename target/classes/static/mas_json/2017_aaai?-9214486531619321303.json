{"title": "Checking the Consistency of Combined Qualitative Constraint Networks.", "fields": ["release consistency", "strong consistency", "weak consistency", "causal consistency", "sequential consistency"], "abstract": "We study the problem of consistency checking for constraint networks over combined qualitative formalisms. We propose a framework which encompasses loose integrations and a form of spatio-temporal reasoning. In particular, we identify sufficient conditions ensuring the polynomiality of consistency checking, and we use them to find tractable subclasses.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Caen Lower Normandy", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Quentin Cohen-Solal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen=Solal:Quentin", "Maroua Bouzid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouzid:Maroua", "Alexandre Niveau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niveau:Alexandre"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
