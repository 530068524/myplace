{"title": "The \"we are stardust\" installation.", "fields": ["digital media", "spitzer space telescope", "sky", "video processing", "data visualization"], "abstract": "\"We Are Stardust\"\" is a digital media interactive installation consisting of two large projected visualizations and a ceiling mounted full rotational FLIR systems infrared imaging camera. Both projections in the installation map the sequence and locations of sky observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared temperature sensing instrument managed by the NASA Spitzer Science Center. The intent of the project is to visually map the schedule of scientific observations: What celestial bodies were looked at, when, for how long, and by whom. This document describes the installation and depicts the engineering work behind the design and construction of the experience.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["George Legrady.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Legrady:George", "Javier Villegas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villegas:Javier", "Andres Burbano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burbano:Andres"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
