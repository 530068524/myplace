{"title": "Attend, Infer, Repeat: Fast Scene Understanding with Generative Models.", "fields": ["inference", "generative grammar", "probabilistic logic", "recurrent neural network", "artificial neural network"], "abstract": "We present a framework for efficient inference in structured image models that explicitly reason about objects. We achieve this by performing probabilistic inference using a recurrent neural network that attends to scene elements and processes them one at a time. Crucially, the model itself learns to choose the appropriate number of inference steps. We use this scheme to learn to perform inference in partially specified 2D models (variable-sized variational auto-encoders) and fully specified 3D models (probabilistic renderers). We show that such models learn to identify multiple objects - counting, locating and classifying the elements of a scene -without any supervision, e.g., decomposing 3D images with various numbers of objects in a single forward pass of a neural network at unprecedented speed. We further show that the networks produce accurate inferences when compared to supervised counterparts, and that their structure leads to improved generalization.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["S.
