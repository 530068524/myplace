Dynamic channel allocation is believed to be an effective way to cope with the shortage of wireless channel resource. In this paper, we propose SPECIAL, which is a Strategy-Proof and EffiCIent multi-channel Auction mechanism for wireLess networks. SPECIAL guarantees the strategy-proofness of the channel auction, exploits wireless channels' spatial reusability, and achieves high channel allocation efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Tianrong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Tianrong", "Fan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Fan", "Chunming Qiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiao:Chunming"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
