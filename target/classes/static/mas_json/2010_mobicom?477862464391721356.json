{"title": "Challenge: towards distributed RFID sensing with software-defined radio.", "fields": ["packet analyzer", "cons", "receiver function", "radio frequency identification", "software defined radio"], "abstract": "Current Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology involves two types of physical devices: tags and reader. The reader combines in a single physical device transmission (to the tags) and reception (from the tags) functions. In this paper we discuss an alternative approach, where receive functions are performed by a separate device called \"RFID listener\". This allows distributed tag-sensing schemes where one transmitter coexists with multiple listeners. We discuss pros and cons of both approaches and present our implementation of a passive RFID listener on GNU Radio. Our implementation is a basis for experimenting with future distributed listener-based systems, but it can be also used as a cheap and flexible protocol analyzer for currently available commercial RFID readers.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["University of Salento", "University of Salento", "University of Salento", "University of Salento", "University of Salento"], "authors": ["Danilo De Donno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Donno:Danilo_De", "Fabio Ricciato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ricciato:Fabio", "Luca Catarinucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catarinucci:Luca", "Angelo Coluccia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coluccia:Angelo", "Luciano Tarricone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarricone:Luciano"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
