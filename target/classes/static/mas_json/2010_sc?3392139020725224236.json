{"title": "190 TFlops Astrophysical N-body Simulation on a Cluster of GPUs.", "fields": ["instruction set", "n body simulation", "flops", "cuda", "gpu cluster"], "abstract": "We present the results of a hierarchical N-body simulation on DEGIMA, a cluster of PCs with 576 graphic processing units (GPUs) and using an InfiniBand interconnect. DEGIMA stands for DEstination for GPU Intensive MAchine, and is located at Nagasaki Advanced Computing Center (NACC), Nagasaki University. In this work, we have upgraded DEGIMA_s interconnect using InfiniBand. DEGIMA is composed by 144 nodes with 576 GT200 GPUs. An astrophysical N-body simulation with 3,278,982,596 particles using a treecode algorithm shows a sustained performance of 190.5 Tflops on DEGIMA. The overall cost of the hardware was $411,921 dollars. The maximum corrected performance is 104.8 Tflops for the simulation, resulting in a cost performance of 254.4 MFlops/$. This corrections is performed by counting the FLOPS based on the most efficient CPU algorithm. Any extra FLOPS that arise from the GPU implementation and parameter differences are not included in the 254.4 MFLOPS/$.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Nagasaki University", "Adv.
