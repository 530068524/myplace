To better understand how to design user interaction with such systems, we implemented three different smart thermostats that automate heating based on users' heating preferences and real-time price variations. We evaluated our designs through a field study, where 30 UK households used our thermostats to heat their homes over a month. Our findings through thematic analysis show that the participants formed different understandings and expectations of our smart thermostat, and used it in various ways to effectively respond to real-time prices while maintaining their thermal comfort. Based on the findings, we present a number of design and research implications, specifically for designing future smart thermostats that will assist us in controlling home heating with real-time pricing, and for future intelligent autonomous systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Zurich", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Zurich"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alper T.
