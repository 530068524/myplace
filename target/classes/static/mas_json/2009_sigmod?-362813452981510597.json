{"title": "Access control in the aqualogic data services platform.", "fields": ["data as a service", "xquery", "information integration", "service oriented architecture", "xml schema"], "abstract": "The AquaLogic Data Services Platform (ALDSP) is a middleware platform for building  data services  that integrate and provide operations over data drawn from spanning multiple heterogeneous information sources. A data service consists of an XML Schema instance, describing its information content, and a collection of XQuery functions and procedures that comprise its set of operations. This paper describes access control in ALDSP. We describe ALDSP's securable resource hierarchy, its fine-grained access control capabilities for securing portions of data service schemas, how XQuery can be used to specify data-driven security policies, and how user identity mapping is supported. We then provide an in-depth overview of how ALDSP works, including implementation techniques to keep access control checking from interacting badly with view rewriting, query optimization, and caching.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "Stanford University", "Oracle Corporation", "BEA Systems Inc ... n Jose, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Vinayak R.
