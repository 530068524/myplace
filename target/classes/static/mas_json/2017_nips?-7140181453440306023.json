{"title": "Efficient Sublinear-Regret Algorithms for Online Sparse Linear Regression with Limited Observation.", "fields": ["polynomial", "machine learning", "linear regression", "sublinear function", "regret"], "abstract": "Online sparse linear regression is the task of applying linear regression analysis to examples arriving sequentially subject to a resource constraint that a limited number of features of examples can be observed. Despite its importance in many practical applications, it has been recently shown that there is no polynomial-time sublinear-regret algorithm unless NP$\\subseteq$BPP, and only an exponential-time sublinear-regret algorithm has been found. In this paper, we introduce mild assumptions to solve the problem. Under these assumptions, we present polynomial-time sublinear-regret algorithms for the online sparse linear regression. In addition, thorough experiments with publicly available data demonstrate that our algorithms outperform other known algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["NEC", "National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics", "NEC", "Japan Science a ... chnology Agency"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shinji Ito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ito:Shinji", "Daisuke Hatano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hatano:Daisuke", "Hanna Sumita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sumita:Hanna", "Akihiro Yabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yabe:Akihiro", "Takuro Fukunaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukunaga:Takuro", "Naonori Kakimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kakimura:Naonori", "Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawarabayashi:Ken=ichi"], "pages": 10}
