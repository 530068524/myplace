Agile methods address this challenge by adopting an incremental development process and delivering working software frequently. However, current validation techniques used in sprint reviews are not sufficient for emerging applications based on ubiquitous technologies. To fill this gap, we propose a new way of demonstration called Software Theater. Based on ideas from theater plays, it aims at presenting scenario-based demonstration in a theatrical way to highlight new features, new user experience and new technical architecture in an integrated performance. We have used Software Theater in more than twenty projects and the result is overall positive.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Han Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Han", "Stephan Krusche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krusche:Stephan", "Bernd Bruegge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruegge:Bernd"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
