It solves simultaneously the problem of categorizing web collections and interpreting the clustering results for navigation. By utilizing prototype hierarchies and the underlying topic structures of the collections, PHC is modeled as a multi-criterion optimization problem based on minimizing the hierarchy evolution, maximizing category cohesiveness and inter-hierarchy structural and semantic resemblance. The flexible design of metrics enables PHC to be a general framework for applications in various domains. In the experiments on categorizing 4 collections of distinct domains, PHC achieves 30% improvement in \u00bc F  1  over the state-of-the-art techniques. Further experiments provide insights on performance variations with abstract and concrete domains, completeness of the prototype hierarchy, and effects of different combinations of optimization criteria.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Zhaoyan Ming.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ming:Zhaoyan", "Kai Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Kai", "Tat-Seng Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Tat=Seng"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
