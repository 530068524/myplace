{"title": "A probabilistic ontological framework for the recognition of multilevel human activities.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "activity recognition", "web ontology language", "description logic", "granularity"], "abstract": "A major challenge of ubiquitous computing resides in the acquisition and modelling of rich and heterogeneous context data, among which, ongoing human activities at different degrees of granularity. In a previous work, we advocated the use of probabilistic description logics (DLs) in a multilevel activity recognition framework. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of activity modeling and reasoning within that framework, as well as an experimental evaluation with a large real-world dataset. Our solution allows us to cope with the uncertain nature of ontological descriptions of activities, while exploiting the expressive power and inference tools of the OWL 2 language. Targeting a large dataset of real human activities, we developed a probabilistic ontology modeling nearly 150 activities and actions of daily living. Experiments with a prototype implementation of our framework confirm the viability of our solution.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["University of Mannheim", "University of Milan", "University of Mannheim"], "authors": ["Rim Helaoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helaoui:Rim", "Daniele Riboni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riboni:Daniele", "Heiner Stuckenschmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stuckenschmidt:Heiner"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
