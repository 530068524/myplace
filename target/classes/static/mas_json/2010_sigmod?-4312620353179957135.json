{"title": "Google fusion tables: web-centered data management and collaboration.", "fields": ["data sharing", "cloud computing", "incentive", "data management", "usability"], "abstract": "It has long been observed that database management systems focus on traditional business applications, and that few people use a database management system outside their workplace. Many have wondered what it will take to enable the use of data management technology by a broader class of users and for a much wider range of applications.   Google Fusion Tables represents an initial answer to the question of how data management functionality that focused on enabling new users and applications would look in today's computing environment. This paper characterizes such users and applications and highlights the resulting principles, such as seamless Web integration, emphasis on ease of use, and incentives for data sharing, that underlie the design of Fusion Tables. We describe key novel features, such as the support for data acquisition, collaboration, visualization, and web-publishing.", "citation": "Citations (188)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Aalborg University", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Hector Gonzalez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonzalez:Hector", "Alon Y.
