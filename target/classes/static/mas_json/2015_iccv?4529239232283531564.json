{"title": "Learning Data-Driven Reflectance Priors for Intrinsic Image Decomposition.", "fields": ["prior probability", "intrinsic value", "energy minimization", "reflectivity", "shading"], "abstract": "We propose a data-driven approach for intrinsic image decomposition, which is the process of inferring the confounding factors of reflectance and shading in an image. We pose this as a two-stage learning problem. First, we train a model to predict relative reflectance ordering between image patches ('brighter', 'darker', 'same') from large-scale human annotations, producing a data-driven reflectance prior. Second, we show how to naturally integrate this learned prior into existing energy minimization frame-works for intrinsic image decomposition. We compare our method to the state-of-the-art approach of Bell et al. [7] on both decomposition and image relighting tasks, demonstrating the benefits of the simple relative reflectance prior, especially for scenes under challenging lighting conditions.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Tinghui Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Tinghui", "Philipp Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=auml=henb=uuml=hl:Philipp", "Alexei A.
