{"title": "Constant rank bimatrix games are PPAD-hard.", "fields": ["open problem", "equivalence", "ppad", "stochastic game", "convex set"], "abstract": "The rank of a bimatrix game ( A, B ) is defined as  rank ( A  +  B ). Computing a Nash equilibrium (NE) of a rank-0, i.e., zero-sum game is equivalent to linear programming (von Neumann'28, Dantzig'51). In 2005, Kannan and Theobald gave an FPTAS for constant rank games, and asked if there exists a polynomial time algorithm to compute an exact NE. Adsul et. al. (2011) answered this question affirmatively for rank-1 games, leaving rank-2 and beyond unresolved.   In this paper we show that NE computation in games with rank \u2265 3, is PPAD-hard, settling a decade long open problem. Interestingly, this is the first instance that a problem with an FPTAS turns out to be PPAD-hard. Our reduction bypasses graphical games and game gadgets, and provides a simpler proof of PPAD-hardness for NE computation in bimatrix games. In addition, we get:   \u2022 An equivalence between 2 D -Linear-FIXP and PPAD, improving a result by Etessami and Yannakakis (2007) on equivalence between Linear-FIXP and PPAD.   \u2022 NE computation in a bimatrix game with convex set of Nash equilibria is as hard as solving a simple stochastic game [12].   \u2022 Computing a symmetric NE of a symmetric bimatrix game with rank \u2265 6 is PPAD-hard.   \u2022 Computing a 1/poly(n)-approximate fixed-point of a (Linear-FIXP) piecewise-linear function is PPAD-hard.   The status of rank-2 games remains unresolved.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ruta Mehta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehta:Ruta"], "pages": 10}
