{"title": "Structural Logical Relations.", "fields": ["analytic proof", "twelf", "proof by contradiction", "structural proof theory", "proof complexity"], "abstract": "Tait's method (a.k.a. proof by logical relations) is a powerful proof technique frequently used for showing foundational properties of languages based on typed lambda-calculi. Historically, these proofs have been extremely difficult to formalize in proof assistants with weak meta-logics, such as Twelf, and yet they are often straightforward in proof assistants with stronger meta-logics. In this paper, we propose structural logical relations as a technique for conducting these proofs in systems with limited meta-logical strength by explicitly representing and reasoning about an auxiliary logic. In support of our claims, we give a Twelf-checked proof of the completeness of an algorithm for checking equality of simply typed lambda-terms.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["IT University of Copenhagen", "Yale University"], "authors": ["Carsten Sch\u00fcrmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=rmann:Carsten", "Jeffrey Sarnat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarnat:Jeffrey"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
