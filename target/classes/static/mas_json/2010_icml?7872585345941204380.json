For example, text documents can be clustered not only by topic, but also by the author's gender or sentiment. Unfortunately, traditional clustering algorithms produce only a single clustering of a dataset, effectively providing a user with just a single view of the data. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm that can discover in an unsupervised manner each clustering dimension along which a dataset can be meaningfully clustered. Its ability to reveal the important clustering dimensions of a dataset in an unsupervised manner is particularly appealing for those users who have no idea of how a dataset can possibly be clustered. We demonstrate its viability on several challenging text classification tasks.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Sajib Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Sajib", "Vincent Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Vincent"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
