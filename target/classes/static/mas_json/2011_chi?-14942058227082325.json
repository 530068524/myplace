In this paper we discuss the exploratory evaluations of the first adolescent intervention to fully integrate a computer game implementing Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Three distinct studies are presented: a detailed evaluation in which therapists independent of the design team used the game with 6 adolescents experiencing clinical anxiety disorders; a study in which a member of the design team used the game with 15 adolescents; and finally a study assessing the acceptability of the game and intervention with 216 practicing therapists. Findings are presented within the context of a framework for the design and evaluation of complex health interventions. The paper provides an in-depth insight into the use of therapeutic games to support adolescent interventions and provides stronger evidence than previously available for both their effectiveness and acceptability to stakeholders.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Trinity College", "University College Dublin", "Trinity College", "University College Dublin"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David Coyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coyle:David", "Nicola McGlade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGlade:Nicola", "Gavin J.
