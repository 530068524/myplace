In-order pipelines sacrifice single-thread performance. Specifically, they do not allow execution to flow freely around data cache misses. As a result, they have difficulties overlapping independent misses with one another.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Andrew D.
