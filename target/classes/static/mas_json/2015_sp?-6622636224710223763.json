{"title": "Every Second Counts: Quantifying the Negative Externalities of Cybercrime via Typosquatting.", "fields": ["typosquatting", "harm", "malware", "latency", "cybercrime"], "abstract": "While we have a good understanding of how cyber crime is perpetrated and the profits of the attackers, the harm experienced by humans is less well understood, and reducing this harm should be the ultimate goal of any security intervention. This paper presents a strategy for quantifying the harm caused by the cyber crime of typo squatting via the novel technique of intent inference. Intent inference allows us to define a new metric for quantifying harm to users, develop a new methodology for identifying typo squatting domain names, and quantify the harm caused by various typo squatting perpetrators. We find that typo squatting costs the typical user 1.3 seconds per typo squatting event over the alternative of receiving a browser error page, and legitimate sites lose approximately 5% of their mistyped traffic over the alternative of an unregistered typo. Although on average perpetrators increase the time it takes a user to find their intended site, many typo squatters actually improve the latency between a typo and its correction, calling into question the necessity of harsh penalties or legal intervention against this flavor of cyber crime.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "RSA Laboratories"], "authors": ["Mohammad Taha Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Mohammad_Taha", "Xiang Huo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huo:Xiang", "Zhou Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhou", "Chris Kanich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanich:Chris"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2015", "pages": 16}
