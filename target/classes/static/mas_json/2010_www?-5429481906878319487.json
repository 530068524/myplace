To produce reliable automatic video summarization algorithms, it is essential to first understand how human beings create video summaries with manual efforts. This paper focuses on a corpus of instructional documentary video, and seeks to improve automatic video summaries by understanding what features in the video catch the eyes and ears of human assessors, and using these findings to inform automatic summarization algorithms. The paper contributes a thorough and valuable methodology for performing automatic video summarization, and the methodology can be extended to inform summarization of other video corpuses.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Yaxiao Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yaxiao", "Gary Marchionini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marchionini:Gary", "Chi Young Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Chi_Young"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
