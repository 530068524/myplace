This approach can be used in a verified compiler, provided that validation is formally proved to be correct. We present two such validators and their Coq proofs of correctness. The validators are designed for two instruction scheduling optimizations: list scheduling and trace scheduling.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Jean-Baptiste Tristan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tristan:Jean=Baptiste", "Xavier Leroy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leroy:Xavier"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2008", "pages": 11}
