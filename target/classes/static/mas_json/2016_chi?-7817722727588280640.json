Drawing on a case study of a body disruption - urinary incontinence in women - we illustrate the experience of women's health both from the perspective of the patient and the therapist. We show how knowledge, esteem and agency play crucial roles in remedial women's care practices, as well as preventative. In describing these challenges we deliberate on possible futures of women's health that take advantage of the many advances in design and technology from across the spectrum of HCI research. We show how with some care and courage HCI has the potential to transform women's experience within this setting.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Teresa Almeida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Almeida:Teresa", "Rob Comber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Comber:Rob", "Madeline Balaam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balaam:Madeline"], "pages": 13}
