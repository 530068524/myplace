{"title": "An Entity-Mention Model for Coreference Resolution with Inductive Logic Programming.", "fields": ["machine learning", "inductive logic programming", "artificial intelligence", "coreference", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "The traditional mention-pair model for coreference resolution cannot capture information beyond mention pairs for both learning and testing. To deal with this problem, we present an expressive entity-mention model that performs coreference resolution at an entity level. The model adopts the Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) algorithm, which provides a relational way to organize different knowledge of entities and mentions. The solution can explicitly express relations between an entity and the contained mentions, and automatically learn first-order rules important for coreference decision. The evaluation on the ACE data set shows that the ILP based entity-mention model is effective for the coreference resolution task.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xiaofeng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Xiaofeng", "Jian Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Jian", "Jun Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:Jun", "Chew Lim Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chew_Lim", "Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ting", "Sheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Sheng"], "pages": 9}
