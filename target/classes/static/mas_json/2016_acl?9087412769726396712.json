To model these intuitions, we introduce a new topic model for documents situated within a network structure, integrating latent blocks of documents with a max-margin learning criterion for link prediction using topicand word-level features. Experiments on a scientific paper dataset and collection of webpages show that, by more robustly exploiting the rich link structure within a document network, our model improves link prediction, topic quality, and block distributions.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Weiwei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Weiwei", "Jordan L.
