Recently a conditional random field auto-encoder has been proposed in a two-layer setting, allowing latent structured representation to be automatically inferred. Aside from being nonconvex, it also requires the demanding inference of normalization. In this paper, we develop a convex relaxation of two-layer conditional model which captures latent structure and estimates model parameters, jointly and optimally. We further expand its applicability by resorting to a weaker form of inference---maximum a-posteriori. The flexibility of the model is demonstrated on two structures based on total unimodularity---graph matching and linear chain. Experimental results confirm the promise of the method.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "NICTA", "University of Waterloo", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Vignesh Ganapathiraman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganapathiraman:Vignesh", "Xinhua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xinhua", "Yaoliang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yaoliang", "Junfeng Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Junfeng"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
