{"title": "SibylFS: formal specification and oracle-based testing for POSIX and real-world file systems.", "fields": ["posix", "world file", "test suite", "unix file types", "epoll"], "abstract": "Systems depend critically on the behaviour of file systems, but that behaviour differs in many details, both between implementations and between each implementation and the POSIX (and other) prose specifications. Building robust and portable software requires understanding these details and differences, but there is currently no good way to systematically describe, investigate, or test file system behaviour across this complex multi-platform interface.   In this paper we show how to characterise the envelope of allowed behaviour of file systems in a form that enables practical and highly discriminating testing. We give a mathematically rigorous model of file system behaviour, SibylFS, that specifies the range of allowed behaviours of a file system for any sequence of the system calls within our scope, and that can be used as a  test oracle  to decide whether an observed trace is allowed by the model, both for validating the model and for testing file systems against it. SibylFS is modular enough to not only describe POSIX, but also specific Linux, OS X and FreeBSD behaviours. We complement the model with an extensive test suite of over 21 000 tests; this can be run on a target file system and checked in less than 5 minutes, making it usable in practice. Finally, we report experimental results for around 40 configurations of many file systems, identifying many differences and some serious flaws.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Leicester", "University of Cambridge", "University of Leicester", "University of Cambridge", "FireEye"], "authors": ["Tom Ridge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ridge:Tom", "David Sheets.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheets:David", "Thomas Tuerk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tuerk:Thomas", "Andrea Giugliano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giugliano:Andrea", "Anil Madhavapeddy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madhavapeddy:Anil", "Peter Sewell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sewell:Peter"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2015", "pages": 16}
