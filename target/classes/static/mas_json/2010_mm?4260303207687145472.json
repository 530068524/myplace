{"title": "Digesting omni-video along routes for navigation.", "fields": ["sort", "elevation", "visibility", "source data", "level of detail"], "abstract": "Omni-directional video records complete visual information along a route. Though replaying an omni-video presents reality, it requires significant amount of memory and communication bandwidth. This work extracts distinct views from an omni-video to form a visual digest named route sheet for navigation. We sort scenes at the motion and visibility level and investigate the similarity/redundancy of scenes in the context of a route. We use source data from 3D elevation map or omni-videos for the view selection. By condensing the flow in the video, our algorithm can generate distinct omni-view sequences with visual information as rich as the omni-video for further scene indexing and navigation with GIS data.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis"], "authors": ["Hongyuan Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Hongyuan", "Jiang Yu Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Jiang_Yu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
