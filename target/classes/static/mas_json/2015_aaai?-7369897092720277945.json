In addition to generating fascinating mathematical questions for computer scientists to ponder, machine teaching holds the promise of enhancing education and personnel training. The Socratic dialogue style aims to stimulate critical thinking.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Xiaojin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Xiaojin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 5}
