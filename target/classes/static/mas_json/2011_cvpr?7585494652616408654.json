{"title": "Internal statistics of a single natural image.", "fields": ["prior probability", "redundancy", "parametric statistics", "data redundancy", "noise measurement"], "abstract": "Statistics of \u2018natural images\u2019 provides useful priors for solving under-constrained problems in Computer Vision. Such statistics is usually obtained from large collections of natural images. We claim that the substantial internal data redundancy within a single natural image (e.g., recurrence of small image patches), gives rise to powerful internal statistics, obtained directly from the image itself. While internal patch recurrence has been used in various applications, we provide a parametric quantification of this property. We show that the likelihood of an image patch to recur at another image location can be expressed parametricly as a function of the spatial distance from the patch, and its gradient content. This \u201cinternal parametric prior\u201d is used to improve existing algorithms that rely on patch recurrence. Moreover, we show that internal image-specific statistics is often more powerful than general external statistics, giving rise to more powerful image-specific priors. In particular: (i) Patches tend to recur much more frequently (densely) inside the same image, than in any random external collection of natural images. (ii) To find an equally good external representative patch for all the patches of an image, requires an external database of hundreds of natural images. (iii) Internal statistics often has stronger predictive power than external statistics, indicating that it may potentially give rise to more powerful image-specific priors.", "citation": "Citations (201)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Maria Zontak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zontak:Maria", "Michal Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Michal"], "pages": 8}
