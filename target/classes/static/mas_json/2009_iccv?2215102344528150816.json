The system consists of a triangular prism, a monochrome camera, and an occlusion mask. Incoming light beams from the scene are sampled by the occlusion mask, dispersed into their constituent spectra by the triangular prism, and then captured by the monochrome camera. Our system is capable of capturing videos of high spectral resolution. It also allows for different tradeoffs between spectral and spatial resolution by adjusting the focal length of the camera. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with several applications, including human skin detection, physical material recognition, and RGB video generation.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Microsoft Research Asia (China)", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft Research Asia (China)"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Hao Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Hao", "Xin Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong_0001:Xin", "Xun Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xun", "Stephen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Stephen"], "pages": 8}
