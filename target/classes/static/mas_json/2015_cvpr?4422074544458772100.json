This paper addresses a new problem of parsing low-resolution aerial videos of large spatial areas, in terms of 1) grouping, 2) recognizing events and 3) assigning roles to people engaged in events. We propose a novel framework aimed at conducting joint inference of the above tasks, as reasoning about each in isolation typically fails in our setting. Given noisy tracklets of people and detections of large objects and scene surfaces (e.g., building, grass), we use a spatiotemporal AND-OR graph to drive our joint inference, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and dynamic programming. We also introduce a new formalism of spatiotemporal templates characterizing latent sub-events. For evaluation, we have collected and released a new aerial videos dataset using a hex-rotor flying over picnic areas rich with group events. Our results demonstrate that we successfully address above inference tasks under challenging conditions.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "California Institute of Technology", "Oregon State University", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tianmin Shu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shu:Tianmin", "Dan Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Dan", "Brandon Rothrock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rothrock:Brandon", "Sinisa Todorovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Todorovic:Sinisa", "Song-Chun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Song=Chun"], "pages": 9}
