{"title": "Why discourse affects speakers' choice of referring expressions.", "fields": ["language production", "expression", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We propose a language production model that uses dynamic discourse information to account for speakers\u2019 choices of referring expressions. Our model extends previous rational speech act models (Frank and Goodman, 2012) to more naturally distributed linguistic data, instead of assuming a controlled experimental setting. Simulations show a close match between speakers\u2019 utterances and model predictions, indicating that speakers\u2019 behavior can be modeled in a principled way by considering the probabilities of referents in the discourse and the information conveyed by each word.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Naho Orita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orita:Naho", "Eliana Vornov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vornov:Eliana", "Naomi Feldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldman:Naomi", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "pages": 11}
