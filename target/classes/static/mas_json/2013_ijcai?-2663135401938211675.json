{"title": "On Robust Estimation of High Dimensional Generalized Linear Models.", "fields": ["robustness", "outlier", "small number", "generalized linear model", "tuple"], "abstract": "We study robust high-dimensional estimation of generalized linear models (GLMs); where a small number k of the n observations can be arbitrarily corrupted, and where the true parameter is high dimensional in the \"p \u226b n\" regime, but only has a small number s of non-zero entries. There has been some recent work connecting robustness and sparsity, in the context of linear regression with corrupted observations, by using an explicitly modeled outlier response vector that is assumed to be sparse. Interestingly, we show, in the GLM setting, such explicit outlier response modeling can be performed in two distinct ways. For each of these two approaches, we give l2 error bounds for parameter estimation for general values of the tuple (n, p, s, k).", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Michigan", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Eunho Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Eunho", "Ambuj Tewari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tewari:Ambuj", "Pradeep Ravikumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravikumar:Pradeep"], "pages": 7}
