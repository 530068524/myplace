{"title": "RADAR: a lightweight tool for requirements and architecture decision analysis.", "fields": ["search based software engineering", "software architecture", "requirement", "requirements analysis", "requirements engineering"], "abstract": "Uncertainty and conflicting stakeholders' objectives make many requirements and architecture decisions particularly hard. Quantitative probabilistic models allow software architects to analyse such decisions using stochastic simulation and multi-objective optimisation, but the difficulty of elaborating the models is an obstacle to the wider adoption of such techniques. To reduce this obstacle, this paper presents a novel modelling language and analysis tool, called RADAR, intended to facilitate requirements and architecture decision analysis. The language has relations to quantitative AND/OR goal models used in requirements engineering and to feature models used in software product lines. However, it simplifies such models to a minimum set of language constructs essential for decision analysis. The paper presents RADAR's modelling language, automated support for decision analysis, and evaluates its application to four real-world examples.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Saheed A.
