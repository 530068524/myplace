{"title": "Text Entry on Tiny QWERTY Soft Keyboards.", "fields": ["diminutive", "wearable computer", "scalability", "smartwatch", "usability"], "abstract": "The advent of wearables (e.g., smartwatches, smartglasses, and digital jewelry) anticipates the need for text entry methods on very small devices. We conduct fundamental research on this topic using 3 qwerty-based soft keyboards for 3 different screen sizes, motivated by the extensive training that users have with qwerty keyboards. In addition to ZoomBoard (a soft keyboard for diminutive screens), we propose a callout-based soft keyboard and ZShift, a novel extension of the Shift pointing technique. We conducted a comprehensive user study followed by extensive analyses on performance, usability, and short-term learning. Our results show that different small screen sizes demand different types of assistance. In general, manufacturers can benefit from these findings by selecting an appropriate qwerty soft keyboard for their devices. Ultimately, this work provides designers, researchers, and practitioners with new understanding of qwerty soft keyboard design space and its scalability for tiny touchscreens.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Valencia", "University of Stuttgart", "Polytechnic University of Valencia", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Luis A.
