{"title": "Edge transitive ramanujan graphs and symmetric LDPC good codes.", "fields": ["low density parity check code", "group code", "forward error correction", "concatenated error correction code", "constant weight code"], "abstract": "We present the first explicit construction of a binary symmetric code with constant rate and constant distance (i.e., good code). Moreover, the code is LDPC and its constraint space is generated by the orbit of one constant weight constraint under the group action. Our construction provides the first symmetric LDPC good codes. In particular, it solves the main open problem raised by Kaufman and Wigderson {8}.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "BIU, Ramat-Gan, Israel"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Tali Kaufman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufman:Tali", "Alexander Lubotzky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lubotzky:Alexander"], "pages": 8}
