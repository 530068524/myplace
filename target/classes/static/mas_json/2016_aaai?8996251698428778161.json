However, different from a natural language sentence, a program contains rich, explicit, and complicated structural information. Hence, traditional NLP models may be inappropriate for programs. In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) for programming language processing, in which a convolution kernel is designed over programs' abstract syntax trees to capture structural information. TBCNN is a generic architecture for programming language processing; our experiments show its effectiveness in two different program analysis tasks: classifying programs according to functionality, and detecting code snippets of certain patterns. TBCNN outperforms baseline methods, including several neural models for NLP.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Stanford University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Lili Mou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mou:Lili", "Ge Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ge", "Lu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0023:Lu", "Tao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Tao", "Zhi Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Zhi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
