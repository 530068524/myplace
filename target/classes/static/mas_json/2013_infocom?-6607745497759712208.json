{"title": "Distributed admission control without knowledge of the capacity region.", "fields": ["scheduling", "wireless network", "bandwidth", "admission control", "resource allocation"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of distributed admission control without knowledge of the capacity region in single-hop wireless networks, for flows that require a pre-specified bandwidth from the network. We present an optimization framework that allows us to design a scheduler and resource allocator, and by properly choosing a suitable utility function in the resource allocator, we prove that existing flows can be served with a prespecified bandwidth, while the link requesting admission can determine the largest rate that it can get such that it does not interfere with the allocation to the existing flows.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["EAFIT University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Juan Jos\u00e9 Jaramillo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaramillo:Juan_Jos=eacute=", "Lei Ying.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ying:Lei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
