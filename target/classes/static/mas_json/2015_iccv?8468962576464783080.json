{"title": "Photogeometric Scene Flow for High-Detail Dynamic 3D Reconstruction.", "fields": ["optical flow", "3d reconstruction", "rgb color model", "smoothness", "photometric stereo"], "abstract": "Photometric stereo (PS) is an established technique for high-detail reconstruction of 3D geometry and appearance. To correct for surface integration errors, PS is often combined with multiview stereo (MVS). With dynamic objects, PS reconstruction also faces the problem of computing optical flow (OF) for image alignment under rapid changes in illumination. Current PS methods typically compute optical flow and MVS as independent stages, each one with its own limitations and errors introduced by early regularization. In contrast, scene flow methods estimate geometry and motion, but lack the fine detail from PS. This paper proposes photogeometric scene flow (PGSF) for high-quality dynamic 3D reconstruction. PGSF performs PS, OF, and MVS simultaneously. It is based on two key observations: (i) while image alignment improves PS, PS allows for surfaces to be relit to improve alignment, (ii) PS provides surface gradients that render the smoothness term in MVS unnecessary, leading to truly data-driven, continuous depth estimates. This synergy is demonstrated in the quality of the resulting RGB appearance, 3D geometry, and 3D motion.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Disney Research"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Paulo F.
