{"title": "Automating string processing in spreadsheets using input-output examples.", "fields": ["user assistance", "program synthesis", "string", "programming by example"], "abstract": "We describe the design of a string programming/expression language that supports restricted forms of regular expressions, conditionals and loops. The language is expressive enough to represent a wide variety of string manipulation tasks that end-users struggle with. We describe an algorithm based on several novel concepts for synthesizing a desired program in this language from input-output examples. The synthesis algorithm is very efficient taking a fraction of a second for various benchmark examples. The synthesis algorithm is interactive and has several desirable features: it can rank multiple solutions and has fast convergence, it can detect noise in the user input, and it supports an active interaction model wherein the user is prompted to provide outputs on inputs that may have multiple computational interpretations.   The algorithm has been implemented as an interactive add-in for Microsoft Excel spreadsheet system. The prototype tool has met the golden test - it has synthesized part of itself, and has been used to solve problems beyond author's imagination.", "citation": "Citations (371)", "departments": ["Microsoft"], "authors": ["Sumit Gulwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gulwani:Sumit"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2011", "pages": 14}
