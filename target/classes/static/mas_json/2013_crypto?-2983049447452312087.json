Such schemes do not rely on permanent secret keys, but rather encrypt messages using keys derived from the messages themselves.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "Microsoft", "Stanford University", "Microsoft", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Mart\u00edn Abadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abadi:Mart=iacute=n", "Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan", "Ilya Mironov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mironov:Ilya", "Ananth Raghunathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghunathan:Ananth", "Gil Segev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segev:Gil"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 18}
