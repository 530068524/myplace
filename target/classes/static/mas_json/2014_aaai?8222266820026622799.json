Nevertheless, some issues have not been addressed well in existing algorithms. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel density-based uncertain data clustering algorithm, which improves upon existing algorithms from the following two aspects: (1) it employs an exact method to compute the probability that the distance between two uncertain objects is less than or equal to a boundary value, instead of the sampling-based method in previous work; (2) it introduces new definitions of core object probability and direct reachability probability, thus reducing the complexity and avoiding sampling. We then further improve the algorithm by using a novel assignment strategy to ensure that every object will be assigned to the most appropriate cluster. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed algorithms over existing ones.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology"], "authors": ["Xianchao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xianchao", "Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Han", "Xiaotong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xiaotong", "Xinyue Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xinyue"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
