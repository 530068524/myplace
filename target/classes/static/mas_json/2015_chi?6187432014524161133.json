Using a grounded theory approach, we detail the kinds of tasks women Wikipedians choose to do and explore why they choose the work they do. We also explore the emotional costs of their labor and their strategies for coping. Our analysis of 20 interviews leads us to posit that the gendered and emotional labor required of many women to participate in Wikipedia's production renders it, problematically, a space of conflicting public and private spheres, motivated by antithetical open and closed values. In addition to other contributions, we believe this insight sheds light on some of the complex dynamics behind Wikipedia's observed gender gap.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Amanda Menking.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menking:Amanda", "Ingrid Erickson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erickson:Ingrid"], "pages": 4}
