While iterative methods are employed to solve flow optimization problems, demands arrive or leave the system changing the optimization instance and requiring further iterations. In this paper, we focus on the general class of iterative solvers considering an exponential decrease over time in the optimality gap. Assuming dynamic arrivals and departures of demands, the computed optimality gap at each iteration Q(t) is described by an auto-regressive stochastic process. At each time slot the controller may choose to apply the current iteration to the network or not. Applying the current iteration improves the optimality gap but requires flow reconfiguration which hurts QoS and system stability. To limit the reconfigurations, we propose two control policies that minimize the flow allocation cost while respecting a network reconfiguration budget. We validate our model by experimenting with a realistic network setting and using standard Linear Programming tools used in the SDN industry. We show that our policies provide a practical means of keeping the optimally gap small within a given reconfiguration constraint.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei"], "authors": ["Stefano Paris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paris:Stefano", "Apostolos Destounis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Destounis:Apostolos", "Lorenzo Maggi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maggi:Lorenzo", "Georgios S.
