We present an approach for computing over-approximations of the set of reachable states. It is based on the notion of support function and thus it allows us to consider invariants, guards and constraints on continuous inputs and initial states defined by arbitrary compact convex sets. We show how the properties of support functions make it possible to derive an effective algorithm for approximate reachability analysis of hybrid systems. We use our approach on some examples including the navigation benchmark for hybrid systems verification.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Grenoble", "University of Grenoble"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Colas Le Guernic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guernic:Colas_Le", "Antoine Girard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Girard:Antoine"], "pages": 15}
