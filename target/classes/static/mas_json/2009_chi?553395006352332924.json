{"title": "Call browser: a system to improve the caller experience by analyzing live calls end-to-end.", "fields": ["user experience design", "voice user interface", "end to end principle", "call management", "interactive voice response"], "abstract": "This paper describes a system that empowers practitioners to substantially improve the user experience with call center automation and agents. Unlike other approaches we analyze the caller experience in live calls end-to-end, from dialing to hangup. A web-based solution, the Call Browser provides access to hundreds or thousands of live end-to-end calls, and empowers usability practitioners and call-center analysts to systematically and efficiently evaluate the caller experience and identify usability issues. Case studies from our consulting practice illustrate how this approach reveals issues that remain hidden to traditional methods, such as log analyses, lab user studies, focus groups, and design guidelines.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["BBN Technologies", "BBN Technologies"], "authors": ["Bernhard Suhm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suhm:Bernhard", "Pat Peterson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peterson:Pat"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
