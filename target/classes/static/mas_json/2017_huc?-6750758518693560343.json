Data quality processes are usually carried out by researchers after careful scrutiny of data. In this paper, we present a platform for quality assurance in mobile sensing campaigns. The platform aims at working with any mobile sensing platform, and it is capable of analyzing and discriminating raw sensor data. In addition, this platform can provide a reputation for the participants based on the quality of the data provided.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Instituto Tecno ...
