It is based on video retargeting, but aims to enhance the aesthetic interest of home produced video sequences. The essential part of video clips are emphasized by automatically zooming in. The camera pans to preserve the important features within the frame while zooming in. Different from traditional video retargeting schemes, we use a variable zooming factor which is based on the motion saliency of frames.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yang Yang Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Yang_Yang", "Mohan S.
