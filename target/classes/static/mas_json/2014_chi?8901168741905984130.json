We conducted a study of combining gaze gestures with vibrotactile feedback. Gaze gestures were used as an input method in a mobile device and vibrotactile feedback as a new alternative way to give confirmation of interaction events. Our results show that vibrotactile feedback significantly improved the use of gaze gestures. The tasks were completed faster and rated easier and more comfortable when vibrotactile feedback was provided.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Tampere", "University of Tampere", "University of Tampere", "University of Tampere", "University of Tampere"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jari Kangas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kangas:Jari", "Deepak Akkil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akkil:Deepak", "Jussi Rantala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rantala:Jussi", "Poika Isokoski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isokoski:Poika", "P\u00e4ivi Majaranta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majaranta:P=auml=ivi", "Roope Raisamo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raisamo:Roope"], "pages": 4}
