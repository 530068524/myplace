{"title": "Multicast Scaling Laws with Hierarchical Cooperation.", "fields": ["cooperative strategy", "scaling", "multicast", "throughput", "cooperative mimo"], "abstract": "A new class of scheduling policies for multicast traffic are proposed in this paper. By utilizing hierarchical cooperative MIMO transmission, our new policies can obtain an aggregate throughput of $\\Omega\\big((\\frac{n}{k})^{1-\\epsilon}\\big)$ for any $\\epsilon>0$. This achieves a gain of nearly $\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k}}$ compared with non-cooperative scheme in \\cite{paper:MulticastCapacityXYLi}. Between the two cooperative strategies in our paper, the converge-based one is superior to the other on delay, while the throughput and energy consumption performances are nearly the same. Moreover, to schedule the traffic in a converge multicast manner instead of the simple multicast, we can dramatically reduce the delay by a factor nearly $(\\frac{n}{k})^\\frac{h}{2}$, where $h>1$ is the number of the hierarchical layers. Our optimal cooperative strategy achieves an approximate delay-throughput tradeoff $D(n,k)/T(n,k)=\\Theta(k)$ when $h\\rightarrow\\infty$. This tradeoff ratio is identical to that of non-cooperative scheme, while the throughput performance is greatly improved. Besides, for certain $k$ and $h$, the tradeoff ratio is even better than that of unicast.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Chenhui Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Chenhui", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing", "Ding Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Ding", "Jun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0007:Jun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
