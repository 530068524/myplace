The system is trained to learn when to transliterate. For Arabic to English MT, we developed and trained a transliterator on a bitext of 7 million sentences and Google\u2019s English terabyte ngrams and achieved better name translation accuracy than 3 out of 4 professional translators. The paper also includes a discussion of challenges in name translation evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Information Sciences Institute", "University of Southern California", "University of Utah"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ulf Hermjakob.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hermjakob:Ulf", "Kevin Knight.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knight:Kevin", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "pages": 9}
