It begins with an analysis of Research through Design abstracts in the ACM digital library and identifies an emerging language and structure of papers in this emerging field. The abstracts: frame a problem space, introduce a study, often involving the deployment of a prototype, and conclude with considerations, reflections and discussion. This format is then pastiched in a series of design fictions written for a project investigating new and emerging forms of reproduction in Art. The fictions take the form of \"imaginary abstracts\" which summarize findings of papers that have not been written about prototypes that do not exist. It is argued that framing concept designs as fictional studies can provide a space for research focused critique and development.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Northumbria University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mark Blythe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blythe:Mark"], "pages": 10}
