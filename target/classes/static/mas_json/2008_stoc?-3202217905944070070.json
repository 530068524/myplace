Using lossy TDFs, we develop a new approach for constructing several important cryptographic primitives, including (injective) trapdoor functions, collision-resistant hash functions, oblivious transfer, and chosen ciphertext-secure cryptosystems. All of the constructions are simple, efficient, and black-box.   These results resolve some long-standing open problems in cryptography. They give the first known injective trapdoor functions based on problems not directly related to integer factorization, and provide the first known CCA-secure cryptosystem based solely on the worst-case complexity of lattice problems.", "citation": "Citations (544)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["SRI International", "SRI International", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris", "Brent Waters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waters:Brent"], "pages": 10}
