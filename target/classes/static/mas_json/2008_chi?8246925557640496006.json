This has several benefits, but we argue that there is a need for a supplementary design approach on the basis the citizen and his or her everyday life. An approach where the main focus is to develop healthcare technology that fits the routines of daily life and thus allows the citizens to continue with the activities they like and have grown used to -- also with an aging body or when managing a chronic condition. Thus, with this approach it is not just a matter of fixing a health condition, more importantly is the matter of sustaining everyday life as a whole. This argument is a result from our work -- using participatory design methods -- on the development of supportive healthcare technology for elderly people and for diabetic, pregnant women.", "citation": "Citations (146)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Stinne Aal\u00f8kke Ballegaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ballegaard:Stinne_Aal=oslash=kke", "Thomas Riisgaard Hansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hansen:Thomas_Riisgaard", "Morten Kyng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kyng:Morten"], "pages": 10}
