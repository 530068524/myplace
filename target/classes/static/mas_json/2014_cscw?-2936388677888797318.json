In this study, we discovered basic conditions, transformation patterns, and mechanisms for avoiding Convergence Property 2 (CP2), and established CP2-avoidance correctness of seven major OT systems. Furthermore, we proposed improvements to existing systems and designed a new OT system capable of avoiding CP2 with a unique combination of novel features. These results contribute significantly to the advancement of OT and collaboration-enabling technology.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Yi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yi", "Chengzheng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Chengzheng", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 14}
