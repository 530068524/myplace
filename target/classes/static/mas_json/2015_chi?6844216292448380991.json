The work specifically aims to understand if gaze can provide benefit in such a task, how task complexity affects performance, and how gaze and multitouch can be combined to create an integral input structure suited to the task of RST. We present four techniques that individually strike a different balance between gaze-based and touch-based translation while maintaining concurrent rotation and scaling operations. A 16 participant empirical evaluation revealed that three of our four techniques present viable options for this scenario, and that larger distances and rotation/scaling operations can significantly affect a gaze-based translation configuration. Furthermore we uncover new insights regarding multimodal integrality, finding that gaze and touch can be combined into configurations that pertain to integral or separable input structures.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Max Planck Society", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jayson Turner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turner:Jayson", "Jason Alexander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alexander:Jason", "Andreas Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Andreas", "Hans Gellersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gellersen:Hans"], "pages": 10}
