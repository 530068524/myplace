First, it is established that the setting of weak learnability aids the entire class, granting a rate O(ln(1/\u220a)). Next, the (disjoint) conditions under which the infimal empirical risk is attainable are characterized in terms of the sample and weak learning class, and a new proof is given for the known rate O(ln(1/\u220a)). Finally, it is established that any instance can be decomposed into two smaller instances resembling the two preceding special cases, yielding a rate O(1/\u220a), with a matching lower bound for the logistic loss. The principal technical hurdle throughout this work is the potential unattainability of the infimal empirical risk; the technique for overcoming this barrier may be of general interest.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Matus Telgarsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Telgarsky:Matus"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
