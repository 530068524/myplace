We show that through this interpretation it is both efficient and straightforward to improve the approximation by employing normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) while still allowing for local reparametrizations (Kingma et al., 2015) and a tractable lower bound (Ranganath et al., 2015; Maaloe et al.,2016). In experiments we show that with this new approximation we can significantly improve upon classical mean field for Bayesian neural networks on both predictive accuracy as well as predictive uncertainty.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Christos Louizos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Louizos:Christos", "Max Welling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welling:Max"], "pages": 10}
