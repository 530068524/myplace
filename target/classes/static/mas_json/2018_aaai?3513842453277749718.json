In this paper, we propose the Gumbel-Greedy Decoding which trains a generative network to predict translation under a trained model. We solve such a problem using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization, which makes our generative network differentiable and trainable through standard stochastic gradient methods. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed model is effective for generating sequences of discrete words.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Jiatao Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Jiatao", "Daniel Jiwoong Im.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Im:Daniel_Jiwoong", "Victor O.
