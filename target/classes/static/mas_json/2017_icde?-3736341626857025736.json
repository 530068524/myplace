{"title": "MASC: Automatic Sleep Stage Classification Based on Brain and Myoelectric Signals.", "fields": ["speech recognition", "feature extraction", "pattern recognition", "electroencephalography", "data mining"], "abstract": "Given brain and myoelectric signals taken from a mouse, how can we classify its sleep stages accurately? Classifying sleep stages is the fundamental problem in recent diagnoses and clinical researches. However, sleep staging suffers from a serious weakness, clinical experts visually inspect the brain and myoelectric signals to improve sleep staging accuracy. This is because recent diagnoses and clinical researches require classification accuracy at least 95% so as to enhance preciseness of their analyses. In this paper, we present an automatic classification method MASC based on the following three approaches: (1) it extracts effective features for fully representing each sleep stage property, (2) it classifies sleep stages by using temporal patterns of sleep stage transitions, and (3) it re-classifies sleep stages only for the results with low-confidence. As a result, MASC achieves more than 95% accuracy for both noisy and noiseless mice data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba"], "authors": ["Yuta Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Yuta", "Makito Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Makito", "Hiroaki Shiokawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shiokawa:Hiroaki", "Masashi Yanagisawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yanagisawa:Masashi", "Hiroyuki Kitagawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kitagawa:Hiroyuki"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
