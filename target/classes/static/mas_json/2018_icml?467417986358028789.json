{"title": "Online Linear Quadratic Control.", "fields": ["exponential growth", "steady state", "quadratic equation", "regret", "time horizon"], "abstract": "We study the problem of controlling linear time-invariant systems with known noisy dynamics and adversarially chosen quadratic losses. We present the first efficient online learning algorithms in this setting that guarantee $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret under mild assumptions, where $T$ is the time horizon. Our algorithms rely on a novel SDP relaxation for the steady-state distribution of the system. Crucially, and in contrast to previously proposed relaxations, the feasible solutions of our SDP all correspond to \"strongly stable\" policies that mix exponentially fast to a steady state.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Bar-Ilan University", "Google", "Google", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Alon Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Alon", "Avinatan Hassidim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassidim:Avinatan", "Tomer Koren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koren:Tomer", "Nevena Lazic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazic:Nevena", "Yishay Mansour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mansour:Yishay", "Kunal Talwar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talwar:Kunal"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
