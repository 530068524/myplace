{"title": "Exact Decoding of Syntactic Translation Models through Lagrangian Relaxation.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "dynamic programming", "decoding methods", "lagrangian relaxation", "syntax"], "abstract": "We describe an exact decoding algorithm for syntax-based statistical translation. The approach uses Lagrangian relaxation to decompose the decoding problem into tractable sub-problems, thereby avoiding exhaustive dynamic programming. The method recovers exact solutions, with certificates of optimality, on over 97% of test examples; it has comparable speed to state-of-the-art decoders.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Columbia University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Alexander M.
