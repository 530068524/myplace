{"title": "Flash Organizations: Crowdsourcing Complex Work by Structuring Crowds As Organizations.", "fields": ["software development", "crowdsourcing", "software deployment", "crowds", "modular design"], "abstract": "This paper introduces flash organizations: crowds structured like organizations to achieve complex and open-ended goals. Microtask workflows, the dominant crowdsourcing structures today, only enable goals that are so simple and modular that their path can be entirely pre-defined. We present a system that organizes crowd workers into computationally-represented structures inspired by those used in organizations - roles, teams, and hierarchies - which support emergent and adaptive coordination toward open-ended goals. Our system introduces two technical contributions: 1) encoding the crowd's division of labor into de-individualized roles, much as movie crews or disaster response teams use roles to support coordination between on-demand workers who have not worked together before; and 2) reconfiguring these structures through a model inspired by version control, enabling continuous adaptation of the work and the division of labor. We report a deployment in which flash organizations successfully carried out open-ended and complex goals previously out of reach for crowdsourcing, including product design, software development, and game production. This research demonstrates digitally networked organizations that flexibly assemble and reassemble themselves from a globally distributed online workforce to accomplish complex work.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Melissa A.
