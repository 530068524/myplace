{"title": "Sparse Deep Transfer Learning for Convolutional Neural Network.", "fields": ["overfitting", "redundancy", "convolutional neural network", "transfer of learning", "multi task learning"], "abstract": "Extensive studies have demonstrated that the representations of convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are learned from a large-scale data set in the source domain, can be effectively transferred to a new target domain. However, compared to the source domain, the target domain often has limited data in practice. In this case, overfitting may significantly depress transferability, due to the model redundancy of the intensive CNN structures. To deal with this difficulty, we propose a novel sparse deep transfer learning approach for CNN. There are three main contributions in this work. First, we introduce a Sparse-SourceNet to reduce the redundancy in the source domain. Second, we introduce a Hybrid-TransferNet to improve the generalization ability and the prediction accuracy of transfer learning, by taking advantage of both model sparsity and implicit knowledge. Third, we introduce a Sparse-TargetNet, where we prune our Hybrid-TransferNet to obtain a highly-compact, source-knowledge-integrated CNN in the target domain. To examine the effectiveness of our methods, we perform our sparse deep transfer learning approach on a number of benchmark transfer learning tasks. The results show that, compared to the standard fine-tuning approach, our proposed approach achieves a significant pruning rate on CNN while improves the accuracy of transfer learning.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Jiaming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jiaming", "Yali Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yali", "Yu Qiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiao_0001:Yu"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
