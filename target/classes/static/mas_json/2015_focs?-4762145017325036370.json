For protocols with r rounds, we prove a lower bound of a#x03A9;(n/r) on the communication required for computing disjointness of input size n, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The previous best lower bound was a#x03A9;(n/r2) due to Jain, Radha krishnan and Sen. Along the way, we develop several tools for quantum information complexity, one of which is a lower bound for quantum information complexity in terms of the generalized discrepancy method. As a corollary, we get that the quantum communication complexity of any boolean function f is at most 2O(QIC(f)), where QIC(f) is the prior-free quantum information complexity of f (with error 1/3).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Mark Braverman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braverman:Mark", "Ankit Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Ankit", "Young Kun-Ko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kun=Ko:Young", "Jieming Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Jieming", "Dave Touchette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Touchette:Dave"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 19}
