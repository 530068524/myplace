Assuming that the unknown part is a Lipschitz continuous surface, we give a logarithmic conditional stability estimate in determining the part of boundary under reasonably a priori information of an unknown part. The keys are the complex extension and estimates for a harmonic measure.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "City University of Hong Kong", "University of Tokyo", "Nagoya University", "Nagoya University", "National Research Nuclear University MEPhI", "Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy", "Zhejiang University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy", "Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy", "Complutense University of Madrid", "Complutense University of Madrid", "Complutense University of Madrid", "Complutense University of Madrid", "Complutense University of Madrid", "University of Tsukuba", "Waseda University", "University of Southern Denmark", "University of California, San Diego", "Queen's University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Lebedev Physics Institute", "ITEP", "UMPA UMR 5669", "Department of Mathematics"], "authors": ["Wei Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong_0001:Wei", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao", "Chun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chun", "Jiajun Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Jiajun", "Chao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
