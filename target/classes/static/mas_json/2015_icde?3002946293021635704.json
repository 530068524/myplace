We introduce Partial Key Grouping (PKG), a new stream partitioning scheme that adapts the classical \u201cpower of two choices\u201d to a distributed streaming setting by leveraging two novel techniques: key splitting and local load estimation. In so doing, it achieves better load balancing than key grouping while being more scalable than shuffle grouping. We test PKG on several large datasets, both real-world and synthetic. Compared to standard hashing, PKG reduces the load imbalance by up to several orders of magnitude, and often achieves nearly-perfect load balance. This result translates into an improvement of up to 60% in throughput and up to 45% in latency when deployed on a real Storm cluster.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Muhammad Anis Uddin Nasir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nasir:Muhammad_Anis_Uddin", "Gianmarco De Francisci Morales.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morales:Gianmarco_De_Francisci", "David Garc\u00eda-Soriano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garc=iacute=a=Soriano:David", "Nicolas Kourtellis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kourtellis:Nicolas", "Marco Serafini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serafini:Marco"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
