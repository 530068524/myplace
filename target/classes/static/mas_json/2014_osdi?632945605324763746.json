{"title": "SAMC: Semantic-Aware Model Checking for Fast Discovery of Deep Bugs in Cloud Systems.", "fields": ["source lines of code", "randomness", "crash", "reboot", "rss"], "abstract": "The last five years have seen a rise of implementation-level distributed system model checkers (dmck) for verifying the reliability of real distributed systems. Existing dmcks however rarely exercise multiple failures due to the state-space explosion problem, and thus do not address present reliability challenges of cloud systems in dealing with complex failures. To scale dmck, we introduce semantic-aware model checking (SAMC), a white-box principle that takes simple semantic information of the target system and incorporates that knowledge into state-space reduction policies. We present four novel reduction policies: local-message independence (LMI), crash-message independence (CMI), crash recovery symmetry (CRS), and reboot synchronization symmetry (RSS), which collectively alleviate redundant reorderings of messages, crashes, and reboots. SAMC is systematic; it does not use randomness or bug-specific knowledge. SAMC is simple; users write protocol-specific rules in few lines of code. SAMC is powerful; it can find deep bugs one to three orders of magnitude faster compared to state-of-the-art techniques.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "Surya University", "University of Chicago", "NEC Labs America"], "authors": ["Tanakorn Leesatapornwongsa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leesatapornwongsa:Tanakorn", "Mingzhe Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Mingzhe", "Pallavi Joshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joshi:Pallavi", "Jeffrey F.
