Here, we provide an empirical analysis of how sustainable HCI is defining itself as a research field. Based on a corpus of published works, we identify (1) established genres in the area, (2) key unrecognized intellectual differences, and (3) emerging issues, including urgent avenues for further exploration, opportunities for interdisciplinary engagement, and key topics for debate.", "citation": "Citations (476)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Ithaca College", "Ithaca College"], "authors": ["Carl F.
