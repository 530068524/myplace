This system overlays a scene from video material onto the real world and allows users to experience how the camera operator captured the scene by inducing them to move as in the same way as the camera operator did. We propose novel interaction techniques that balance the competing goals of inducing users to move in the same way as the camera operator and allowing them to feel that they are observing freely. The proposed methods implement three induction techniques to induce the user to avoid unintentional movements, and to start moving the device and rotate it appropriately. We implemented this system in an exhibition system that relives the video of old railways and exhibited it at the railway museum for two weeks. The analysis results of users' operational logs and questionnaires suggest that the proposed system and interaction techniques are effective for reliving video experiences in the real world.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Takuya Arakawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arakawa:Takuya", "Kazuhiro Kasada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasada:Kazuhiro", "Takuji Narumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narumi:Takuji", "Tomohiro Tanikawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanikawa:Tomohiro", "Michitaka Hirose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirose:Michitaka"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
