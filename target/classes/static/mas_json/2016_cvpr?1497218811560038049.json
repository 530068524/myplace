Our method improves feature point matching upon the state-of-the art and can be used in conjunction with any existing rotation sensitive descriptors. To avoid the tedious and almost impossible task of finding a target orientation to learn, we propose to use Siamese networks which implicitly find the optimal orientations during training. We also propose a new type of activation function for Neural Networks that generalizes the popular ReLU, maxout, and PReLU activation functions. This novel activation performs better for our task. We validate the effectiveness of our method extensively with four existing datasets, including two non-planar datasets, as well as our own dataset. We show that we outperform the state-of-the-art without the need of retraining for each dataset.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kwang Moo Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Kwang_Moo", "Yannick Verdie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verdie:Yannick", "Pascal Fua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fua:Pascal", "Vincent Lepetit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepetit:Vincent"], "pages": 10}
