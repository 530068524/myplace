{"title": "Adapting Discriminative Reranking to Grounded Language Learning.", "fields": ["language acquisition", "syntax", "discriminative model", "natural language processing", "parsing"], "abstract": "We adapt discriminative reranking to improve the performance of grounded language acquisition, specifically the task of learning to follow navigation instructions from observation. Unlike conventional reranking used in syntactic and semantic parsing, gold-standard reference trees are not naturally available in a grounded setting. Instead, we show how the weak supervision of response feedback (e.g. successful task completion) can be used as an alternative, experimentally demonstrating that its performance is comparable to training on gold-standard parse trees.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Joohyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Joohyun", "Raymond J.
