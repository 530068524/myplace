{"title": "Stochastic Approximation for Canonical Correlation Analysis.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "machine learning", "matrix", "stochastic approximation", "canonical correlation"], "abstract": "We propose novel first-order stochastic approximation algorithms for canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Algorithms presented are instances of inexact matrix stochastic gradient (MSG) and inexact matrix exponentiated gradient (MEG), and achieve $\\epsilon$-suboptimality in the population objective in $\\operatorname{poly}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ iterations. We also consider practical variants of the proposed algorithms and compare them with other methods for CCA both theoretically and empirically.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Raman Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora:Raman", "Teodor Vanislavov Marinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinov:Teodor_Vanislavov", "Poorya Mianjy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mianjy:Poorya", "Nati Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nati"], "pages": 10}
