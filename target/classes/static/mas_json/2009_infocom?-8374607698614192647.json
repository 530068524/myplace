Many safety applications need safety warning messages to be broadcast to all vehicles present in an area. Design of a medium access control (MAC) protocol for vehicular networks is an interesting problem because of challenges posed by broadcast traffic, high mobility, high reliability and low delay requirements of these networks. In this article, we propose a topology-transparent broadcast protocol and present a detailed mathematical analysis for obtaining the probability of success and the average delay. We show, by analysis and simulations, that the proposed protocol outperforms two existing protocols for vehicular networks with topology-transparent properties and provides reliable broadcast communications for delivering safety messages under load conditions deemed to be common in vehicular environments.", "citation": "Citations (173)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Farzad Farnoud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farnoud:Farzad", "Shahrokh Valaee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valaee:Shahrokh"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
