{"title": "Measuring and Improving the Core Resilience of Networks.", "fields": ["complex network", "machine learning", "psychological resilience", "artificial intelligence", "graph"], "abstract": "k-cores have emerged as an important concept for understanding the global structure of networks, as well as for identifying central or important nodes within a network. It is often valuable to understand the resilience of the k-cores of a network to attacks and dropped edges (i.e., damaged communications links). We provide a formal definition of a network\u2019s core resilience, and examine the problem of characterizing core resilience in terms of the network\u2019s structural features: in particular, which structural properties cause a network to have high or low core resilience? To measure this, we introduce two novel node properties \u2013 Core Strength and Core Influence, which measure the resilience of individual nodes\u2019 core numbers and their influence on other nodes\u2019 core numbers. Using these properties, we propose algorithms to add edges to increase the core resilience of a network. We consider two attack scenarios, randomly deleted edges and randomly deleted nodes. Through experiments on a variety of technological and infrastructure network datasets, we verify the efficacy of our node-based resilience measures at predicting the resilience of a network, and evaluate our algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Syracuse University", "University at Buffalo", "Northeastern University", "Sandia National Laboratories", "Syracuse University"], "authors": ["Ricky Laishram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laishram:Ricky", "Ahmet Erdem Sariy\u00fcce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sariy=uuml=ce:Ahmet_Erdem", "Tina Eliassi-Rad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eliassi=Rad:Tina", "Ali Pinar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinar:Ali", "Sucheta Soundarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soundarajan:Sucheta"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
