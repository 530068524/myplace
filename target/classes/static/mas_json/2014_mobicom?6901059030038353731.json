{"title": "Combating inter-cell interference in 802.11ac-based multi-user MIMO networks.", "fields": ["deliverable", "multi user mimo", "beamforming", "single antenna interference cancellation", "streams"], "abstract": "In an 802.11ac-based MU-MIMO network comprised of multiple cells 1 , inter-cell interference allows only a single AP to serve its clients at the same time, significantly limiting the network capacity. In this work, we overcome this limitation by letting the APs and clients in interfering cells coordinately cancel the inter-cell interference using their antennas for beamforming. To achieve such coordinated interference cancellation in a practical way, we propose a novel two-step optimization. First, without requiring any channel knowledge, each AP and client optimizes the use of its antennas for either data communication or inter-cell interference cancellation, in order to maximize the total number of deliverable streams in the MU-MIMO network. Second, with only partial channel knowledge, each AP and client optimizes their beamforming weights after the optimal antenna usage has been identified in the first step. Our solution, CoaCa, integrates this two-step optimization into 802.11ac with small modifications and negligible overhead, allowing each AP and client to locally perform the two-step optimization. Our experimental evaluation indicates that for a MU-MIMO network with two cells, by cancelling the inter-cell interference CoaCa can convert the majority of the expected number of streams increase (50%-67%) into network capacity improvement (41%-52%).", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Hang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Hang", "Oscar Bejarano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bejarano:Oscar", "Lin Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong_0001:Lin"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
