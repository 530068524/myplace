{"title": "Beyond Equilibrium: Predicting Human Behavior in Normal-Form Games.", "fields": ["epsilon equilibrium", "best response", "equilibrium selection", "solution concept", "sequential equilibrium"], "abstract": "It is standard in multiagent settings to assume that agents will adopt Nash equilibrium strategies. However, studies in experimental economics demonstrate that Nash equilibrium is a poor description of human players' initial behavior in normal-form games. In this paper, we consider a wide range of widely-studied models from behavioral game theory. For what we believe is the first time, we evaluate each of these models in a meta-analysis, taking as our data set large-scale and publicly-available experimental data from the literature. We then propose modifications to the best-performing model that we believe make it more suitable for practical prediction of initial play by humans in normal-form games.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["James R.
