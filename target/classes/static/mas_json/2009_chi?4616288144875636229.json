In this paper we describe a project which explores their benefit in the East, to support non-textual information sharing in an Indian village. Local audiovisual story creation and sharing activities were carried out in a one month trial, using 10 customized cameraphones and a digital library of stories represented on a village display. The findings show that the system was usable by a cross-section of the community and valued for its ability to express a mixture of development and community information in an accessible form. Lessons for the role of HCI in this context are also discussed.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "University of Surrey", "University of Surrey", "VOICES, Bangalore, India", "VOICES, Bangalore, India"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David M.
