We introduce Everest, a SQL-compliant data warehousing engine, based on a column architecture that we have built and deployed at Yahoo!. In contrast to commercially available engines, this massively parallel engine, based on commodity hardware, offers scale, flexibility, specialized analytic operations, and lower administrative & hardware costs. In this paper, we describe the business motivation and the software and deployment architecture of Everest. The engine is in production at Yahoo! since 2007 and currently manages over six petabytes of data.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Mona Ahuja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahuja:Mona", "Cheng Che Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Cheng_Che", "Ravi Gottapu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottapu:Ravi", "J\u00f6rg Hallmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hallmann:J=ouml=rg", "Waqar Hasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasan:Waqar", "Richard Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Richard", "Maciek Kozyrczak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozyrczak:Maciek", "Ramesh Pabbati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pabbati:Ramesh", "Neeta Pandit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandit:Neeta", "Sreenivasulu Pokuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pokuri:Sreenivasulu", "Krishna Uppala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uppala:Krishna"], "pages": 8}
