{"title": "Enhancing Bitcoin Security and Performance with Strong Consistency via Collective Signing.", "fields": ["commit", "database transaction", "liveness", "latency", "wait"], "abstract": "While showing great promise, Bitcoin requires users to wait tens of minutes for transactions to commit, and even then, offering only probabilistic guarantees. This paper introduces ByzCoin, a novel Byzantine consensus protocol that leverages scalable collective signing to commit Bitcoin transactions irreversibly within seconds. ByzCoin achieves Byzantine consensus while preserving Bitcoin's open membership by dynamically forming hash power-proportionate consensus groups that represent recently-successful block miners. ByzCoin employs communication trees to optimize transaction commitment and verification under normal operation while guaranteeing safety and liveness under Byzantine faults, up to a near-optimal tolerance of f faulty group members among 3f + 2 total. ByzCoin mitigates double spending and selfish mining attacks by producing collectively signed transaction blocks within one minute of transaction submission. Tree-structured communication further reduces this latency to less than 30 seconds. Due to these optimizations, ByzCoin achieves a throughput higher than PayPal currently handles, with a confirmation latency of 15-20 seconds.", "citation": "Citations (140)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Eleftherios Kokoris-Kogias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kokoris=Kogias:Eleftherios", "Philipp Jovanovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jovanovic:Philipp", "Nicolas Gailly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gailly:Nicolas", "Ismail Khoffi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khoffi:Ismail", "Linus Gasser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gasser:Linus", "Bryan Ford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ford:Bryan"], "pages": 18}
