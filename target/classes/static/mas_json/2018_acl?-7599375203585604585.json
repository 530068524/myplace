{"title": "Modeling Naive Psychology of Characters in Simple Commonsense Stories.", "fields": ["computer science", "natural language processing", "annotation", "artificial intelligence", "narrative"], "abstract": "Understanding a narrative requires reading between the lines and reasoning about the unspoken but obvious implications about events and people's mental states - a capability that is trivial for humans but remarkably hard for machines. To facilitate research addressing this challenge, we introduce a new annotation framework to explain naive psychology of story characters as fully-specified chains of mental states with respect to motivations and emotional reactions. Our work presents a new large-scale dataset with rich low-level annotations and establishes baseline performance on several new tasks, suggesting avenues for future research.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Southern California", "University of Washington"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kevin Knight.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knight:Kevin", "Yejin Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Yejin", "Maarten Sap.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sap:Maarten", "Hannah Rashkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rashkin:Hannah", "Antoine Bosselut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosselut:Antoine"], "pages": 11}
