In our system we use face recognition and voice recognition from data recorded in an interactive dialogue system. In such a system, sequential images and sequential utterances can be used to improve recognition accuracy over single hypotheses. The presented approach uses confidence-based fusion for sequence hypotheses, for multimodal fusion, and to provide a reliability measure of the classification quality that can be used to decide when to trust and when to ignore classification results.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University Karl ... lsruhe, Germany", "University Karl ... lsruhe, Germany", "University Karl ... lsruhe, Germany"], "authors": ["Philipp W.
