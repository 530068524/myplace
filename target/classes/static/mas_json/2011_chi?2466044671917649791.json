While exceptions exist, and alternative populations are sometimes studied, virtually any introduction to the process of designing user interfaces will discuss the importance of understanding the intended users as well as the significant impact individual differences can have on how effectively individuals can use various technologies. HCI researchers are expected to provide relevant demographics regarding study participants as well as information about experience using similar technologies. Yet, in the field of accessibility we continue to see studies that do not appropriately include representative users. Highlighting ways to remedy this multifaceted problem, we argue that expectations regarding how accessibility research is conducted and reported must be raised if this field is to have the desired impact with regard to inclusive design, the information technologies studied, and the lives of the individuals being studied.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Dundee", "Rochester Institute of Technology", "University of Dundee"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Andrew Sears.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sears:Andrew", "Vicki L.
