The network presents common features of traditional social networks such as a giant component, small average path length and high clustering, but differs from them showing moderate reciprocity and neutral assortativity by degree. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical tests, we show that the degree distributions are better explained by log-normal instead of power-law distributions. We also study the structure of discussion threads using an intuitive radial tree representation. Threads show strong heterogeneity and self-similarity throughout the different nesting levels of a conversation. We use these results to propose a simple measure to evaluate the degree of controversy provoked by a post.", "citation": "Citations (283)", "departments": ["Pompeu Fabra University", "Pompeu Fabra University", "Barcelona Media ... arcelona, Spain"], "authors": ["Vicen\u00e7 G\u00f3mez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=oacute=mez:Vicen=ccedil=", "Andreas Kaltenbrunner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaltenbrunner:Andreas", "Vicente L\u00f3pez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=oacute=pez_0002:Vicente"], "conf": "www", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
