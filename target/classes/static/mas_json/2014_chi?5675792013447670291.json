{"title": "Interrupted by a phone call: exploring designs for lowering the impact of call notifications for smartphone users.", "fields": ["interrupt", "phone", "real time computing", "interaction design", "interaction model"], "abstract": "Mobile phones have evolved significantly in recent years from single-purpose communication devices to multi-purpose computing devices. Despite this evolution, the interaction model for how incoming calls are handled has barely changed. Current-generation smartphones still use abrupt full-screen notifications to alert users to incoming calls, demanding a decision to either accept or decline the call. These full-screen notifications forcibly interrupt whatever activity the user was already engaged in. This might be undesirable when the user's primary task was more important than the incoming call. This paper explores the design space for how smartphones can alert users to incoming calls. We consider designs that allow users to  postpone calls  and also to  multiplex  by way of a smaller partial-screen notification. These design alternatives were evaluated in both a small-scale controlled lab study as well as a large-scale naturalistic in-the-wild study. Results show that a  multiplex  design solution works best because it allows people to continue working on their primary task while being made aware that there is a caller on the line. The contribution of this work is an enhanced interaction design for handling phone calls, and an understanding of how people use it for handling incoming calls.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "University College London", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Matthias B\u00f6hmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hmer_0001:Matthias", "Christian Lander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lander:Christian", "Sven Gehring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehring:Sven", "Duncan P.
