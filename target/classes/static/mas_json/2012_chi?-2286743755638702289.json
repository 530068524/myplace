We suggest participatory design as an approach to improving the quality of design for older people but, based on previous work and our own experiences, identify four central issues that participatory design approaches need to address. We describe an approach to early engagement in design with older people that address each of these issues and some of our experiences applying the approach in a variety of different design projects. We conclude by discussing some of the issues that have been highlighted when attempting apply this approach in different design contexts and the issues that have been raised when working with partners who are less committed to the idea of engaging with older adults in participatory design.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "authors": ["Stephen Lindsay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindsay:Stephen", "Daniel Jackson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jackson_0002:Daniel", "Guy Schofield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schofield:Guy", "Patrick Olivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivier:Patrick"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
