The toolbox is designed with an emphasis on simplicity and flexibility. It exposes the building blocks of CNNs as easy-to-use MATLAB functions, providing routines for computing convolutions with filter banks, feature pooling, normalisation, and much more. MatConvNet can be easily extended, often using only MATLAB code, allowing fast prototyping of new CNN architectures. At the same time, it supports efficient computation on CPU and GPU, allowing to train complex models on large datasets such as ImageNet ILSVRC containing millions of training examples", "citation": "Citations (1,658)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Andrea Vedaldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vedaldi:Andrea", "Karel Lenc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lenc:Karel"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
