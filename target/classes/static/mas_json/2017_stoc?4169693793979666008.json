As a consequence, given a circuit  C  of size  s  computing a polynomial  f \u00e2  F\u00e2 \ufffd  z  1 , z  2 ,\u00e2 \ufffd, z   n   \u00e2 \u00a9 with at most  t  non-zero monomials, then testing if  f  is identically zero can be done by a randomized algorithm with running time polynomial in  s  and  n  and log t . This makes significant progress on a question that has been open for over ten years. Our algorithm is based on automata-theoretic ideas that can efficiently isolate a monomial in the given polynomial. In particular, we carry out the monomial isolation using nondeterministic automata.   In general, noncommutative circuits of size  s  can compute polynomials of degree exponential in  s  and number of monomials double-exponential in  s . In this paper, we consider a natural class of homogeneous noncommutative circuits, that we call +-regular circuits, and give a  white-box  polynomial time deterministic polynomial identity test. These circuits can compute noncommutative polynomials with number of monomials double-exponential in the circuit size. Our algorithm combines some new structural results for +-regular circuits with known results for noncommutative ABP identity testing, rank bound of commutative depth three identities, and equivalence testing problem for words. Finally, we consider the  black-box  identity testing problem for depth three +-regular circuits and give a randomized polynomial time identity test. In particular, we show if  f \u00e2  \u00e2 \ufffd  Z \u00e2 \u00a9 is a nonzero noncommutative polynomial computed by a depth three +-regular circuit of size  s , then  f  cannot be a polynomial identity for the matrix algebra M  s  (F) when F is sufficiently large depending on the degree of  f .", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Vishwakarma Institute of Technology", "Chennai Mathematical Institute", "Chennai Mathematical Institute", "Institute of Ma ...
