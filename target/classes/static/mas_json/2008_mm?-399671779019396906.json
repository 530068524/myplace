We aim to discover exemplars from search results and simultaneously group the images. The exemplars are delivered to the user as a summary of search results instead of the large amount of unorganized images. This gives the user a brief overview of search results with a small amount of images, and helps the user to further find the images of interest. We adopt the idea of affinity propagation and design a fast sparse affinity propagation algorithm to find exemplars that best represent the image search results. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method both visually and quantitatively.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yangqing Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yangqing", "Jingdong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingdong", "Changshui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Changshui", "Xian-Sheng Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Xian=Sheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
