We prove a (3+1/86)n-o(n) lower bound onthe size of such a circuit for an explicitly definedpredicate, namely an affine disperser for sublinear dimension. This improves the 3n-o(n) bound of Norbert Blum (1984).The proof is based on the gate elimination technique extended with the following three ideas. We generalize the computational model by allowing circuits to contain cycles, this in turn allows us to perform affine substitutions. We use a carefully chosen circuit complexity measure to track the progress of the gate elimination process. Finally, we use quadratic substitutions that may be viewed as delayed affine substitutions.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["New York University", "Russian Academy of Sciences", "National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics"], "authors": ["Magnus Gausdal Find.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Find:Magnus_Gausdal", "Alexander Golovnev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golovnev:Alexander", "Edward A.
