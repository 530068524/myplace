Here we specifically consider surprisal, a word\u2019s predictability in context. Existing approaches have mostly used n-gram models or more sophisticated syntax-based parsing models; this largely does not account for effects specific to semantics. We build on the work by Mitchell et al. (2010) and show that the semantic prediction model suggested there can successfully predict spoken word durations in naturalistic conversational data. An interesting finding is that the training data for the semantic model also plays a strong role: the model trained on indomain data, even though a better language model for our data, is not able to predict word durations, while the out-ofdomain trained language model does predict word durations. We argue that this at first counter-intuitive result is due to the out-of-domain model better matching the \u201clanguage models\u201d of the speakers in our data.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Asad B.
