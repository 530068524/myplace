In this paper, we use a geometric perspective to prove that minimal peer prediction mechanisms are equivalent to power diagrams, a type of weighted Voronoi diagram. Using this characterization and results from computational geometry, we show that many of the mechanisms in the literature are unique up to affine transformations, and introduce a general method to construct new truthful mechanisms.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Rafael M.
