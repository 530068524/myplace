{"title": "Fusion in Information Retrieval: SIGIR 2018 Half-Day Tutorial.", "fields": ["data mining", "ranking", "fusion", "information retrieval", "merge"], "abstract": "Fusion is an important and central concept in Information Retrieval. The goal of fusion methods is to merge different sources of information so as to address a retrieval task. For example, in the adhoc retrieval setting, fusion methods have been applied to merge multiple document lists retrieved for a query. The lists could be retrieved using different query representations, document representations, ranking functions and corpora. The goal of this half day, intermediate-level, tutorial is to provide a methodological view of the theoretical foundations of fusion approaches, the numerous fusion methods that have been devised and a variety of applications for which fusion techniques have been applied.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "RMIT University"], "authors": ["Oren Kurland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurland:Oren", "J.
