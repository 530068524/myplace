Such environments allow potentially several concurrently visible videos on a single display device, and consequently, network and processing bottlenecks. As a first step towards an avoidance of such problems, we have performed subjective assessments using a 3D application prototype to determine how positioning of video in the 3D environment influences the user perception of reduced-quality videos. Using video clips from several genres, we have compared the influence of various ways to reduce video quality and users' perception of degraded quality. We evaluated the influence of distance and angle of the placement.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Simula Research Laboratory", "Simula Research Laboratory", "Simula Research Laboratory", "Simula Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Pengpeng Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Pengpeng", "Fredrik Gaarder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaarder:Fredrik", "Carsten Griwodz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Griwodz:Carsten", "P\u00e5l Halvorsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halvorsen:P=aring=l"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
