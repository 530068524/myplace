{"title": "Indoor weather stations: investigating a ludic approach to environmental HCI through batch prototyping.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "human computer interaction", "multimedia", "affection", "narrative"], "abstract": "In this project, we investigated how a ludic approach might open new possibilities for environmental HCI by designing three related devices that encourage environmental awareness while eschewing utilitarian or persuasive agendas. In addition, we extended our methodological approach by batch-producing multiple copies of each device and deploying them to 20 households for several months, gathering a range of accounts about how people engaged and used them. The devices, collectively called the 'Indoor Weather Stations', reveal the home's microclimate by highlighting small gusts of wind, the colour of ambient light, and temperature differentials within the home. We found that participants initially tended to relate to the devices in line with two 'orienting narratives' of environmental tools or ludic designs, finding the devices disappointing from either perspective. Most of our participants showed lingering affection for the devices, however, for a variety of reasons. We discuss the implications of this 'sporadic interaction', and the more general lessons from the project, both for environmental HCI and ludic design.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["Goldsmiths, University of London", "Goldsmiths, University of London", "Goldsmiths, University of London", "Goldsmiths, University of London", "Goldsmiths, University of London"], "authors": ["William W.
