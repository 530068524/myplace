We present a simpler approach based on relative prime decompositions that leads to a nondeterministic exponential-time algorithm, this is \"close\" to the known exponential-time lower bound. We also derive that semantic finiteness (the question if a given nor med BPA process is branching bisimilar with some finite-state process) belongs to NExpTime as well.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "Technical University of Ostrava"], "authors": ["Wojciech Czerwinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czerwinski:Wojciech", "Petr Jancar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jancar:Petr"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
