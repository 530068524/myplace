A key task in the automated identification of such news is the detection of novel documents from a voluminous stream of text documents in a scalable manner. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce the problem of online l1-dictionary learning where unlike traditional dictionary learning, which uses squared loss, the l1-penalty is used for measuring the reconstruction error. We present an efficient online algorithm for this problem based on alternating directions method of multipliers, and establish a sublinear regret bound for this algorithm. Empirical results on news-stream and Twitter data, shows that this online l1-dictionary learning algorithm for novel document detection gives more than an order of magnitude speedup over the previously known batch algorithm, without any significant loss in quality of results.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["General Electric", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "IBM"], "authors": ["Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasiviswanathan:Shiva_Prasad", "Huahua Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huahua", "Arindam Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Arindam", "Prem Melville.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melville:Prem"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
