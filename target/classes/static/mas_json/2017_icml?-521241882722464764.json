Hypothesis Tests, $\\ell_2$-consistency and Neuroscience Applications.", "fields": ["pooling", "executable", "statistical hypothesis testing", "inference", "sample size determination"], "abstract": "Many studies in biomedical and health sciences involve small sample sizes due to logistic or financial constraints. Often, identifying weak (but scientifically interesting) associations between a set of predictors and a response necessitates pooling datasets from multiple diverse labs or groups. While there is a rich literature in statistical machine learning to address distributional shifts and inference in multi-site datasets, it is less clear ${\\it when}$ such pooling is guaranteed to help (and when it does not) -- independent of the inference algorithms we use. In this paper, we present a hypothesis test to answer this question, both for classical and high dimensional linear regression. We precisely identify regimes where pooling datasets across multiple sites is sensible, and how such policy decisions can be made via simple checks executable on each site before any data transfer ever happens. With a focus on Alzheimer's disease studies, we present empirical results showing that in regimes suggested by our analysis, pooling a local dataset with data from an international study improves power.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Hao Henry Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Hao_Henry", "Yilin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yilin", "Vamsi K.
