{"title": "Answering regular path queries on workflow provenance.", "fields": ["bounded function", "reachability", "remainder", "query optimization", "recursion"], "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach for efficiently evaluating regular path queries over provenance graphs of workflows that may include recursion. The approach assumes that an execution g of a workflow G is labeled with query-agnostic reachability labels using an existing technique. At query time, given g, G and a regular path query R, the approach decomposes R into a set of subqueries R 1 , \u2026, R k  that are safe for G. For each safe subquery R i , G is rewritten so that, using the reachability labels of nodes in g, whether or not there is a path which matches R i  between two nodes can be decided in constant time. The results of each safe subquery are then composed, possibly with some small unsafe remainder, to produce an answer to R. The approach results in an algorithm that significantly reduces the number of subqueries k over existing techniques by increasing their size and complexity, and that evaluates each subquery in time bounded by its input and output size. Experimental results demonstrate the benefit of this approach.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Genome Institute of Singapore", "Facebook", "University of Pennsylvania", "Tel Aviv University", "Nankai University"], "authors": ["Xiaocheng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xiaocheng", "Zhuowei Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Zhuowei", "Susan B.
