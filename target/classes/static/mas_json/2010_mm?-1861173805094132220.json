Since the emotions that arise in the viewer of an image are highly subjective, they are rarely indexed. However there are situations when it would be helpful if images could be retrieved based on their emotional content. We investigate and develop methods to extract and combine low-level features that represent the emotional content of an image, and use these for image emotion classification. Specifically, we exploit theoretical and empirical concepts from psychology and art theory to extract image features that are specific to the domain of artworks with emotional expression. For testing and training, we use three data sets: the International Affective Picture System (IAPS); a set of artistic photography from a photo sharing site (to investigate whether the conscious use of colors and textures displayed by the artists improves the classification); and a set of peer rated abstract paintings to investigate the influence of the features and ratings on pictures without contextual content. Improved classification results are obtained on the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), compared to state of the art work.", "citation": "Citations (417)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Information Retrieval Facility"], "authors": ["Jana Machajdik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Machajdik:Jana", "Allan Hanbury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanbury:Allan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
