Our results hold for games with two or up to countably many players.   Several of these results are corollaries of stronger results that we establish about equilibria in infinite sequential games with some weak conditions on the occurring preference relations. We also formulate an abstract equilibrium transfer result about games with compact strategy spaces and open preferences. Finally, we consider a dynamical improvement rule for infinite sequential games with continuous payoff functions.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["St\u00e9phane Le Roux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roux_0001:St=eacute=phane_Le", "Arno Pauly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pauly:Arno"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
