We provide an algorithm for computing r--divisions with few holes in linear time. In fact, our algorithm computes a structure, called  decomposition tree , which represents a recursive decomposition of G that includes r--divisions for essentially all values of r. In particular, given an exponentially increasing sequence {vec r} = (r 1 ,r 2 ,...), our algorithm can produce a  recursive  {vec r}--division with few holes in linear time.      r--divisions with few holes have been used in efficient algorithms to compute shortest paths, minimum cuts, and maximum flows. Our linear-time algorithm improves upon the decomposition algorithm used in the state-of-the-art algorithm for minimum st--cut (Italiano, Nussbaum, Sankowski, and Wulff-Nilsen, STOC 2011), removing one of the bottlenecks in the overall running time of their algorithm (analogously for minimum cut in planar and bounded-genus graphs).", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Brown University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Philip N.
