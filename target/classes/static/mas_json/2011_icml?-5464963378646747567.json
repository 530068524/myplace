Taking advantage of modern hardware requires using multiple parallel programming models targeted at different devices (e.g. CPUs and GPUs). However, programming these devices to run efficiently and correctly is difficult, error-prone, and results in software that is harder to read and maintain. We present OptiML, a domain-specific language (DSL) for machine learning. OptiML is an implicitly parallel, expressive and high performance alternative to MATLAB and C++. OptiML performs domain-specific analyses and optimizations and automatically generates CUDA code for GPUs. We show that OptiML outperforms explicitly parallelized MATLAB code in nearly all cases.", "citation": "Citations (175)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Stanford University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Arvind K.
