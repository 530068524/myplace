Contextual contents are combined via a function to produce the context influence factor, which is then combined with each latent factor to derive latent representations. We instantiate the generic framework using biased Matrix Factorization as the base model. A Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) based optimization procedure is developed to fit the model by jointly learning the weight of each context and latent factors. Experiments conducted over three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms not only the base model but also the representative context-aware recommendation models.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Institute for I ... pore, Singapore", "Institute for I ... pore, Singapore"], "authors": ["Xin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xin", "Wei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Wei"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
