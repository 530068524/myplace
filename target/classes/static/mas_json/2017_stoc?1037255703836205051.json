In particular, this implies that integer programs max{ c   T    x  :  Q   x \u00e2 \ufffd  b ,  x \u00e2   \u00e2 \ufffd  0   n  }, where  Q \u00e2   \u00e2 \ufffd  m \ufffd   n   has the property that all subdeterminants are bounded by 2 in absolute value, can be solved in strongly polynomial time. We thus obtain an extension of the well-known result that integer programs with constraint matrices that are totally unimodular are solvable in strongly polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Stephan Artmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Artmann:Stephan", "Robert Weismantel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weismantel:Robert", "Rico Zenklusen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zenklusen:Rico"], "pages": 14}
