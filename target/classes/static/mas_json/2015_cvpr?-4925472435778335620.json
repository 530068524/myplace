Unlike previous approaches that only reason locally, we propose to exploit the global structure of the scene to estimate its depth. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical representation of the scene, which models local depth jointly with mid-level and global scene structures. We formulate single image depth estimation as inference in a graphical model whose edges let us encode the interactions within and across the different layers of our hierarchy. Our method therefore still produces detailed depth estimates, but also leverages higher-level information about the scene. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over local depth estimation methods on standard indoor datasets.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wei Zhuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuo_0004:Wei", "Mathieu Salzmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salzmann:Mathieu", "Xuming He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xuming", "Miaomiao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Miaomiao"], "pages": 9}
