However, Markov processes are notoriously difficult to control. Recently, Markov constraints have been introduced to give users some control on generated sequences. Markov constraints reformulate finite-length Markov sequence generation in the framework of constraint satisfaction (CSP). However, in practice, this approach is limited to local constraints and its performance is low for global constraints, such as cardinality or arithmetic constraints. This limitation prevents generated sequences to satisfy structural properties which are independent of the style, but inherent to the domain, such as meter. In this article, we introduce meter, a constraint that ensures a sequence is 1) Markovian with regards to a given corpus and 2) follows metrical rules expressed as cumulative cost functions. Additionally, meter can simultaneously enforce cardinality constraints. We propose a domain consistency algorithm whose complexity is pseudo-polynomial. This result is obtained thanks to a theorem on the growth of sumsets by Khovanskii. We illustrate our constraint on meter-constrained music generation problems that were so far not solvable by any other technique.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Sony CSL, Paris, France", "Sony CSL, Paris, France"], "authors": ["Pierre Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Pierre", "Fran\u00e7ois Pachet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pachet:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
