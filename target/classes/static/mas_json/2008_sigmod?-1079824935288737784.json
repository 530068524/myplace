{"title": "The DBO database system.", "fields": ["data mining", "online aggregation", "abort", "scalability", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "We demonstrate our prototype of the DBO database system. DBO is designed to facilitate scalable analytic processing over large data archives. DBO's analytic processing performance is competitive with other database systems; however, unlike any other existing research or industrial system, DBO maintains a statistically meaningful guess to the final answer to a query from start to finish during query processing. This guess may be quite accurate after only a few seconds or minutes, while answering a query exactly may take hours. This can result in significant savings in both user and computer time, since a user can abort a query as soon as he or she is happy with the guess' accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Florin Rusu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rusu:Florin", "Fei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Fei", "Luis Leopoldo Perez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perez:Luis_Leopoldo", "Mingxi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Mingxi", "Ravi Jampani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jampani:Ravi", "Chris Jermaine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jermaine:Chris", "Alin Dobra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobra:Alin"], "pages": 4}
