{"title": "Strong Normalization for System F by HOAS on Top of FOAS.", "fields": ["abstract syntax", "higher order abstract syntax", "system f", "normalization", "hol"], "abstract": "We present a point of view concerning HOAS(Higher-Order Abstract Syntax) and an extensive exercise in HOAS along this point of view. The point of view is that HOAS can be soundly and fruitfully regarded as a definitional extension on top of FOAS (First-Order Abstract Syntax). As such, HOAS is not only an encoding technique, but also a higher-order view of a first-order reality. A rich collection of concepts and proof principles is developed inside the standard mathematical universe to give technical life to this point of view. The exercise consists of a new proof of Strong Normalization for System F. The concepts and results presented here have been formalized in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Andrei Popescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popescu_0001:Andrei", "Elsa L.
