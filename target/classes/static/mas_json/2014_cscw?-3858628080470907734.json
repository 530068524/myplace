{"title": "Enabling relationship building in tabletop-supported advisory settings.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "design knowledge", "computer science", "transparency", "design elements and principles"], "abstract": "Recent research has shown that financial advisory encounters can successfully be supported with IT-artifacts. Tabletop scenarios, for example, can increase the transparency of the advisory process for customers. However, we have also had the experience that the relationship quality as experienced by customers can suffer severely when IT-artifacts are introduced. Based on these experiences, we developed guidelines for both, the artifact- design itself as well as for the environment in order to avoid this effect, and implemented them in one of our prototypes. The evaluation reveals that these measures proved to be effective. With the reported study, we seek to enhance our design knowledge of IT-supported advisory scenarios with a special focus on relationship building. In a larger context, we argue that the use of IT during sensitive face-to-face encounters will be of growing significance in the future but, as yet, is hardly understood. We make a contribution in this area with our generic requirements, design principles and evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "University of Zurich"], "authors": ["Peter Heinrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinrich:Peter", "Mehmet Kilic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kilic:Mehmet", "Felix-Robinson Aschoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aschoff:Felix=Robinson", "Gerhard Schwabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwabe:Gerhard"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 13}
