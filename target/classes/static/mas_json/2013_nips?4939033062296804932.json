The standard way to solve ridge regression in this setting works in the dual space and gives a running time of O(n2p). Our algorithm Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform- Dual Ridge Regression (SRHT-DRR) runs in time O(np log(n)) and works by preconditioning the design matrix by a Randomized Walsh-Hadamard Transform with a subsequent subsampling of features. We provide risk bounds for our SRHT-DRR algorithm in the fixed design setting and show experimental results on synthetic and real datasets.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Yichao Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yichao", "Paramveer S.
