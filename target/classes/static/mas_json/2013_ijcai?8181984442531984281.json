{"title": "Learning Topical Translation Model for Microblog Hashtag Suggestion.", "fields": ["social media", "small number", "microblogging", "topic model", "sentiment analysis"], "abstract": "Hashtags can be viewed as an indication to the context of the tweet or as the core idea expressed in the tweet. They provide valuable information for many applications, such as information retrieval, opinion mining, text classification, and so on. However, only a small number of microblogs are manually tagged. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a topical translation model for microblog hashtag suggestion. We assume that the content and hashtags of the tweet are talking about the same themes but written in different languages. Under the assumption, hashtag suggestion is modeled as a translation process from content to hashtags. Moreover, in order to cover the topic of tweets, the proposed model regards the translation probability to be topic-specific. It uses topic-specific word trigger to bridge the vocabulary gap between the words in tweets and hashtags, and discovers the topics of tweets by a topic model designed for microblogs. Experimental results on the dataset crawled from real world microblogging service demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhuoye Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Zhuoye", "Xipeng Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Xipeng", "Qi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Qi", "Xuanjing Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xuanjing"], "pages": 7}
