This bound is empirically investigated for a standard AlexNet network trained with SGD on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, with both original and random labels; the bound, the Lipschitz constants, and the excess risks are all in direct correlation, suggesting both that SGD selects predictors whose complexity scales with the difficulty of the learning task, and secondly that the presented bound is sensitive to this complexity.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of California, Berkeley", "Cornell University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Peter L.
