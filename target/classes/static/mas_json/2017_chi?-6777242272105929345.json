{"title": "LetsPic: Supporting In-situ Collaborative Photography over a Large Physical Space.", "fields": ["photography", "trips architecture", "mobile computing", "wireless site survey", "in situ"], "abstract": "Recent advances in mobile computing technology have made it increasingly common for collocated users to perform collaborative photography over a large physical space in various group activity scenarios such as field trips, site surveys, and group tours. Unlike traditional collocated interactions in a shared physical space, we find that mobility and group dynamics make awareness of group activities over a large physical space very challenging. In this work, we design LetsPic, a group photoware that supports group awareness for in-situ collaborative photography over the large physical space. We have iteratively built the app and performed user studies in site survey and group tour scenarios (n = 31, n = 24). Our results confirmed that LetsPic effectively promotes group awareness, facilitates group coordination, and encourages collaboration in both scenarios. We discuss practical design implications based on our findings.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Auk Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Auk", "Sungjoon Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Sungjoon", "Uichin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Uichin"], "pages": 13}
