Recently, a lot of CNN accelerators based on the CNN intrinsic parallelism are proposed. However, we observed that there is a big mismatch between the parallel types supported by computing engine and the dominant parallel types of CNN workloads. This mismatch seriously degrades resource utilization of existing accelerators. In this paper, we propose aflexible dataflow architecture (FlexFlow) that can leverage the complementary effects among feature map, neuron, and synapse parallelism to mitigate the mismatch. We evaluated our design with six typical practical workloads, it acquires 2-10x performance speedup and 2.5-10x power efficiency improvement compared with three state-of-the-art accelerator architectures. Meanwhile, FlexFlow is highly scalable with growing computing engine scale.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Wenyan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Wenyan", "Guihai Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Guihai", "Jiajun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiajun", "Shijun Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Shijun", "Yinhe Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Yinhe", "Xiaowei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiaowei"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
