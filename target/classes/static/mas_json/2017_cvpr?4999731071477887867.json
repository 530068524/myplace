{"title": "Depth from Defocus in the Wild.", "fields": ["aperture", "kernel", "flow map", "photography", "brightness"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of two-frame depth from defocus in conditions unsuitable for existing methods yet typical of everyday photography: a handheld cellphone camera, a small aperture, a non-stationary scene and sparse surface texture. Our approach combines a global analysis of image content\u20143D surfaces, deformations, figure-ground relations, textures\u2014with local estimation of joint depth-flow likelihoods in tiny patches. To enable local estimation we (1) derive novel defocus-equalization filters that induce brightness constancy across frames and (2) impose a tight upper bound on defocus blur\u2014just three pixels in radius\u2014through an appropriate choice of the second frame. For global analysis we use a novel piecewise-spline scene representation that can propagate depth and flow across large irregularly-shaped regions. Our experiments show that this combination preserves sharp boundaries and yields good depth and flow maps in the face of significant noise, uncertainty, non-rigidity, and data sparsity.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Huixuan Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Huixuan", "Scott Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Scott", "Brian L.
