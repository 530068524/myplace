However, the growth is not adequately supported by a framework with which to understand each new system in the context of the old. We classify human computation systems to help identify parallels between different systems and reveal \"holes\" in the existing work as opportunities for new research. Since human computation is often confused with \"crowdsourcing\" and other terms, we explore the position of human computation with respect to these related topics.", "citation": "Citations (840)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alexander J.
