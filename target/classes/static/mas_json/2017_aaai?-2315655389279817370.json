{"title": "CLARE: A Joint Approach to Label Classification and Tag Recommendation.", "fields": ["data mining", "social media", "data classification", "computer science", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Data classification and tag recommendation are both important and challenging tasks in social media. These two tasks are often considered independently and most efforts have been made to tackle them separately. However, labels in data classification and tags in tag recommendation are inherently related. For example, a Youtube video annotated with NCAA, stadium, pac12 is likely to be labeled as football, while a video/image with the class label of coast is likely to be tagged with beach, sea, water and sand. The existence of relations between labels and tags motivates us to jointly perform classification and tag recommendation for social media data in this paper. In particular, we provide a principled way to capture the relations between labels and tags, and propose a novel framework CLARE, which fuses data CLAssification and tag REcommendation into a coherent model. With experiments on three social media datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework CLARE achieves superior performance on both tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Michigan State University", "University of Central Florida", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Yilin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yilin", "Suhang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Suhang", "Jiliang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jiliang", "Guo-Jun Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Guo=Jun", "Huan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Huan", "Baoxin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baoxin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
