Many modern constraint solvers use a bitset data structure to encode the values contained in the variable domains. Using the algorithmic techniques developed for the Word-RAM, we propose new filtering algorithms that can prune O(w) values from a domain in a single instruction. Experiments show that on a processor with w = 64, the new filtering algorithms that enforce domain consistency on the constraints A + B = C, |A B| = C and ALL-DIFFERENT can offer a speed up of a factor 10.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Laval University", "Laval University"], "authors": ["Philippe Van Kessel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kessel:Philippe_Van", "Claude-Guy Quimper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quimper:Claude=Guy"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
