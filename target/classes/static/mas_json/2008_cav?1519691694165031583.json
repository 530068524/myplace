{"title": "Faster Than Uppaal?", "fields": ["timed automaton", "mutual exclusion", "theoretical computer science", "model checking", "greedy algorithm"], "abstract": "It is probably very hard to develop a new model checker that is faster than  Uppaal for verifying  (correct) timed automata. In fact, our tool  Mcta does not even try to compete with  Uppaal in this (i.e.,  Uppaal 's) arena. Instead,  Mcta is geared towards analyzing  incorrect specifications of timed automata. It returns (shorter) error traces faster.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Sebastian Kupferschmid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kupferschmid:Sebastian", "Martin Wehrle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wehrle:Martin", "Bernhard Nebel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nebel:Bernhard", "Andreas Podelski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Podelski:Andreas"], "pages": 4}
