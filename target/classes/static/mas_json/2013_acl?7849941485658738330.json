Two main challenges of this task are the dearth of information in a single tweet and the rich entity mention variations. To address these challenges, we propose a collective inference method that simultaneously resolves a set of mentions. Particularly, our model integrates three kinds of similarities, i.e., mention-entry similarity, entry-entry similarity, and mention-mention similarity, to enrich the context for entity linking, and to address irregular mentions that are not covered by the entity-variation dictionary. We evaluate our method on a publicly available data set and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xiaohua Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaohua", "Yitong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yitong", "Haocheng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Haocheng", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming", "Furu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Furu", "Yi Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yi"], "pages": 8}
