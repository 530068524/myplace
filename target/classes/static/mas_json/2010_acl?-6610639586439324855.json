{"title": "A Risk Minimization Framework for Extractive Speech Summarization.", "fields": ["minification", "redundancy", "probabilistic logic", "natural language processing", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "In this paper, we formulate extractive summarization as a risk minimization problem and propose a unified probabilistic framework that naturally combines supervised and unsupervised summarization models to inherit their individual merits as well as to overcome their inherent limitations. In addition, the introduction of various loss functions also provides the summarization framework with a flexible but systematic way to render the redundancy and coherence relationships among sentences and between sentences and the whole document, respectively. Experiments on speech summarization show that the methods deduced from our framework are very competitive with existing summarization approaches.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National Taiwan Normal University", "National Taiwan Normal University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shih-Hsiang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Shih=Hsiang", "Berlin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Berlin"], "pages": 9}
