{"title": "Starling: Lightweight Concurrency Verification with Views.", "fields": ["satisfiability modulo theories", "lock", "starling", "heap", "solver"], "abstract": "Modern program logics have made it feasible to verify the most complex concurrent algorithms. However, many such logics are complex, and most lack automated tool support. We propose Starling, a new lightweight logic and automated tool for concurrency verification. Starling takes a proof outline written in an abstracted Hoare-logic style, and converts it into proof terms that can be discharged by a sequential solver. Starling\u2019s approach is generic in its structure, making it easy to target different solvers. In this paper we verify shared-variable algorithms using the Z3 SMT solver, and heap-based algorithms using the GRASShopper solver. We have applied our approach to a range of concurrent algorithms, including Rust\u2019s atomic reference counter, the Linux ticketed lock, the CLH queue-lock, and a fine-grained list algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of York", "University of York", "University of York", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Matt Windsor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Windsor:Matt", "Mike Dodds.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dodds:Mike", "Ben Simner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simner:Ben", "Matthew J.
