The block-diagonal structure is heavily desired for accurate sample clustering but is rather difficult to obtain. Most current state-of-the-art subspace segmentation methods (such as SSC[4] and LRR[12]) resort to alternative structural priors (such as sparseness and low-rankness) to construct the affinity matrix. In this work, we directly pursue the block-diagonal structure by proposing a graph Laplacian constraint based formulation, and then develop an efficient stochastic subgradient algorithm for optimization. Moreover, two new subspace segmentation methods, the block-diagonal SSC and LRR, are devised in this work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research attempt to explicitly pursue such a block-diagonal structure. Extensive experiments on face clustering, motion segmentation and graph construction for semi-supervised learning clearly demonstrate the superiority of our novelly proposed subspace segmentation methods.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Peking University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jiashi Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jiashi", "Zhouchen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhouchen", "Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng"], "pages": 8}
