{"title": "Location-aware cache management for many-core processors with deep cache hierarchy.", "fields": ["cache invalidation", "bus sniffing", "snoopy cache", "smart cache", "cache pollution"], "abstract": "As cache hierarchies become deeper and the number of cores on a chip increases, managing caches becomes more important for performance and energy. However, current hardware cache management policies do not always adapt optimally to the applications behavior: e.g., caches may be polluted by data structures whose locality cannot be captured by the caches, and producer-consumer communication incurs multiple round trips of coherence messages per cache line transferred. We propose load and store instructions that carry hints regarding into which cache(s) the accessed data should be placed. Our instructions allow software to convey locality information to the hardware, while incurring minimal hardware cost and not affecting correctness. Our instructions provide a 1.07x speedup and a 1.24x energy efficiency boost, on average, according to simulations on a 64-core system with private L1 and L2 caches. With a large shared L3 cache added, the benefits increase, providing 1.33x energy reduction on average.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "University of Michigan", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Jongsoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jongsoo", "Richard M.
