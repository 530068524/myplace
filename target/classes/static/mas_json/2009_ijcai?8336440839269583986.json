With a kernel-based classifier, there are two options to set up kernels: select a specific kernel for each label or the same kernel for all labels. In this work, we present a unified framework for multi-label multiple kernel learning, in which the above two approaches can be considered as two extreme cases. Moreover, our framework allows the kernels shared partially among multiple labels, enabling flexible degrees of label commonality. We systematically study how the sharing of kernels among multiple labels affects the performance based on extensive experiments on various benchmark data including images and microarray data. Interesting findings concerning efficacy and efficiency are reported.", "citation": "Citations (39)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Lei Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Lei", "Jianhui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jianhui", "Jieping Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jieping"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
