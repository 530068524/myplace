In contrast to traditional designers, green designers appear to: (1) Bias decisions (2) Design from a deep, personal ethos; (3) Accept 'not knowing' as a part of the design process; (4) Rely on alternative ways of knowing, and; (5) Shift roles as needed throughout the design process. While a superficial treatment of these differences might seem to disenfranchise green designers, we show that an analysis of green design as a discursive practice highlights how, through engagement with others, green design can enhance pro-environmental dialog and enact meaningful change.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Earl Friedberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedberg:Earl", "Edward Lank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lank:Edward"], "pages": 12}
