While recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of wearable sensors for illicit drug use detection in the lab setting, several key problems can limit lab-to-field generalization performance. For example, lab-based data collection often has low ecological validity, the ground-truth event labels collected in the lab may not be available at the same level of temporal granularity in the field, and there can be significant variability between subjects. In this paper, we present domain adaptation methods for assessing and mitigating potential sources of performance loss in lab-to-field generalization and apply them to the problem of cocaine use detection from wearable electrocardiogram sensor data.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Annamalai Natarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Natarajan:Annamalai", "Gustavo Angarita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angarita:Gustavo", "Edward Gaiser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaiser:Edward", "Robert Malison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malison:Robert", "Deepak Ganesan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganesan:Deepak", "Benjamin M.
