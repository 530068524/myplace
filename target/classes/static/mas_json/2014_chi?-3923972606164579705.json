{"title": "A novel knee rehabilitation system for the home.", "fields": ["randomized controlled trial", "rehabilitation", "simulation", "knee replacement", "usability"], "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of an interactive home-based rehabilitation visualisation system used by a wide variety of ages (users in our studies were aged from 47-89) to undertake rehabilitation in the home following knee replacement surgery. We present the rehabilitation visualization system and the results of a randomized controlled study in which we investigated the usability and feasibility of the system in the home. We found that our users were able to use the system successfully for their rehabilitation with improved rehabilitation outcomes after 6 weeks when compared to the current rehabilitation care. Finally we highlight the lessons learned which will benefit prospective designers of home rehabilitation technology in ensuring successful home evaluations in clinical rehabilitation.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Glasgow Caledonian University", "Glasgow Caledonian University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mobolaji Ayoade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ayoade:Mobolaji", "Lynne Baillie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baillie:Lynne"], "pages": 10}
