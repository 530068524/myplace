{"title": "Joint tracking and segmentation of multiple targets.", "fields": ["segmentation based object categorization", "preprocessor", "scale space segmentation", "feature detection", "image texture"], "abstract": "Tracking-by-detection has proven to be the most successful strategy to address the task of tracking multiple targets in unconstrained scenarios [e.g. 40, 53, 55]. Traditionally, a set of sparse detections, generated in a preprocessing step, serves as input to a high-level tracker whose goal is to correctly associate these \u201cdots\u201d over time. An obvious short-coming of this approach is that most information available in image sequences is simply ignored by thresholding weak detection responses and applying non-maximum suppression. We propose a multi-target tracker that exploits low level image information and associates every (super)-pixel to a specific target or classifies it as background. As a result, we obtain a video segmentation in addition to the classical bounding-box representation in unconstrained, real-world videos. Our method shows encouraging results on many standard benchmark sequences and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tracking-by-detection approaches in crowded scenes with long-term partial occlusions.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Anton Milan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milan:Anton", "Laura Leal-Taix\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leal=Taix=eacute=:Laura", "Konrad Schindler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schindler:Konrad", "Ian D.
