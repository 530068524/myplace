This new query is beneficial to travelers who are asking directions or planning a trip in an unfamiliar city/area, as historical traveling experiences can reveal how people usually choose routes between locations. To achieve this goal, we firstly develop a Coherence Expanding algorithm to retrieve a transfer network from raw trajectories, for indicating all the possible movements between locations. After that, the Absorbing Markov Chain model is applied to derive a reasonable transfer probability for each transfer node in the network, which is subsequently used as the popularity indicator in the search phase. Finally, we propose a Maximum Probability Product algorithm to discover the MPR from a transfer network based on the popularity indicators in a breadth-first manner, and we illustrate the results and performance of the algorithm by extensive experiments.", "citation": "Citations (238)", "departments": ["University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland"], "authors": ["Zaiben Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zaiben", "Heng Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Heng_Tao", "Xiaofang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiaofang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
