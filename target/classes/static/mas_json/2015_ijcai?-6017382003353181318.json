The standard algorithm for MCTS is Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (UCT). For games such as Go a big improvement over UCT is the Rapid Action Value Estimation (RAVE) heuristic. We propose to generalize the RAVE heuristic so as to have more accurate estimates near the leaves. We test the resulting algorithm named GRAVE for Atarigo, Knighthrough, Domineering and Go.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University"], "authors": ["Tristan Cazenave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cazenave:Tristan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
