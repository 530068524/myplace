{"title": "Towards a system theoretic approach to wireless network capacity in finite time and space.", "fields": ["probability distribution", "static routing", "spacetime", "queueing theory", "wireless network"], "abstract": "In asymptotic regimes, both in time and space (network size), the derivation of network capacity results is grossly simplified by brushing aside queueing behavior in nonJackson networks. This simplifying double-limit model, however, lends itself to conservative numerical results in finite regimes. To properly account for queueing behavior beyond a simple calculus based on average rates, we advocate a system theoretic methodology for the capacity problem in finite time and space regimes. This methodology also accounts for spatial correlations arising in networks with CSMA/CA scheduling and it delivers rigorous closed-form capacity results in terms of probability distributions. Unlike numerous existing asymptotic results, subject to anecdotal practical concerns, our transient results can be used in practical settings, e.g., to compute the time scales at which multi-hop routing is more advantageous than single-hop routing.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "T-Labs., Tech.  ...
