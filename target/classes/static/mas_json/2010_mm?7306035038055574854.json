{"title": "Spatially refined inter-sequence error concealment for a multi-broadcast receiver using frequency selective approximation.", "fields": ["image registration", "digital television", "broadcasting", "error concealment", "pixel"], "abstract": "Mobile reception of digital TV often suffers from severe signal degradations. Inter-sequence error concealment reconstructs lost image blocks of a distorted high-resolution TV signal by inserting corresponding error-free blocks from a low-resolution reference TV signal. It is well-suited for application in future automotive multi-broadcast receivers and can outperform state-of-the-art methods by up to 15 dB PSNR Y  depending on the quality of the reference signal. In this contribution, we show that inter-sequence error concealment can be improved by approximating inserted blocks jointly with neighboring pixels according to a well-known frequency selective method. The reconstruction quality can be significantly increased especially in case of low-bitrate reference signals. Inserted blocks can be further refined also for high bitrates. On average, a gain of 1.7 dB PSNR Y  can be achieved. The peak gain which is evaluated on frame basis even reaches 5.6 dB PSNR Y .", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"], "authors": ["Tobias Tr\u00f6ger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tr=ouml=ger:Tobias", "J\u00fcrgen Seiler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seiler:J=uuml=rgen", "Andr\u00e9 Kaup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaup:Andr=eacute="], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
