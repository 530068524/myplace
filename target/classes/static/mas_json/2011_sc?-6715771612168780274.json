This GPU version is developed based on a CPU DFT-PWP code: PEtot, which can calculate up to a thousand atoms on thousands of processors. Our test indicates that the GPU version can have a \u223c10 times speed-up over the CPU version. A detail analysis of the speed-up and the scaling on the number of CPU/GPU computing units \u2021  (up to 256) are presented. The success of our speed-up relies on the adoption a hybrid reciprocal-space and band-index parallelization scheme. As far as we know, this is the first GPU DFT-PWP code scalable to large number of CPU/GPU computing units. We also outlined the future work, and what is needed to further increase the computational speed by another factor of 10.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Fudan University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Fudan University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Long Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0008:Long", "Yue Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yue", "Weile Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Weile", "Weiguo Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Weiguo", "Xuebin Chi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chi:Xuebin", "Lin-Wang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lin=Wang"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
