{"title": "Integrating corrections into digital ink playback.", "fields": ["computer vision", "inkwell", "multimedia", "artificial intelligence", "workflow"], "abstract": "In this paper, we describe preliminary work on an ink editing application that allows an instructor to correct mistakes to digital ink written during a presentation that is to be archived. These corrections are then seamlessly reintegrated into the digital archive so that when the presentation is replayed the corrected ink is displayed instead of the original incorrect ink. We base our results on a system we have developed and prototype the work flow from initial presentation, through correction, updating the archive and playback. We show that a simple mechanism for correction is effective and low effort for the instructor. A key technical challenge that is addressed is the substitution of strokes by matching of the original and corrected ink.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Richard J.
