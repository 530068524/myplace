As multicultural multiparty collaboration becomes ubiquitous, it is crucial to understand how communication processes are shaped in the social and media environments that computer-mediated communication affords. We conducted a laboratory study investigating how different types of cultural asymmetry in group composition (Chinese of the majority versus American of the majority) and communication media (text-only versus video-enabled chatroom) influence conversational similarity between Chinese and Americans. The paper presents an analysis identifying that the selection of media and the cultural composition of the group jointly shape intercultural conversational closeness.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Hao-Chuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hao=Chuan", "Susan R.
