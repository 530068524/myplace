We present algorithms that estimate camera movement from accelerometer readings and apply the estimation to significantly improve the compute-intense motion estimation in video encoding. We have implemented a working prototype that simultaneously captures video and three-axis acceleration data. The video is then compressed with a reference MPEG-2 encoder, modified to incorporate the accelerometer readings to assist motion estimation. Our experimental data shows a two to three times speed improvement for the entire encoding process, in comparison with full search.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Rice University", "National University of Singapore", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Guangming Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Guangming", "Ahmad Rahmati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahmati:Ahmad", "Ye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ye", "Lin Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong_0001:Lin"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
