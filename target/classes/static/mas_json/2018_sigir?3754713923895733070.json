{"title": "A Large-Scale Study of Mobile Search Examination Behavior.", "fields": ["mobile web", "information retrieval", "mobile device", "viewport", "mobile search"], "abstract": "With the rapid growth of mobile web search, it is necessary and important to understand user's examination behavior on mobile devices in the absence of clicks. Previous studies used viewport metrics to estimate user's attention. However, there still lacks an in-depth understanding of how search users examine and interact with the mobile SERP. In this work, based on the large-scale real search log collected from a popular commercial mobile search engine, we present a comprehensive analysis of examination behavior. Specifically, we analyze the position bias, the relationship with click behavior, and examination's change as the session continues. The findings shed new light on the understanding of user's examination behavior, and also provide some implication for the improvement and evaluation of mobile search engine.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Beijing Normal University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Xiaochuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaochuan", "Ning Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Ning", "Zexue He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Zexue", "Yiqun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yiqun", "Shaoping Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shaoping"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
