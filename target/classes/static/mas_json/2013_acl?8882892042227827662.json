SSL techniques are often effective in text classification, where labeled data is scarce but large unlabeled corpora are readily available. However, existing SSL techniques typically require multiple passes over the entirety of the unlabeled data, meaning the techniques are not applicable to large corpora being produced today. In this paper, we show that improving marginal word frequency estimates using unlabeled data can enable semi-supervised text classification that scales to massive unlabeled data sets. We present a novel learning algorithm, which optimizes a Naive Bayes model to accord with statistics calculated from the unlabeled corpus. In experiments with text topic classification and sentiment analysis, we show that our method is both more scalable and more accurate than SSL techniques from previous work.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Electrical Engi ... omputer Science"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Michael Lucas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucas:Michael", "Doug Downey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Downey:Doug"], "pages": 9}
