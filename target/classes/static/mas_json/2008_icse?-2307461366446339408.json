Here, we demonstrate  Genie , a tool that supports the modelling, generation, and operation of highly reconfigurable, component-based systems. We showcase how Genie is used in two case-studies: i) the development and operation of an adaptive flood warning system, and ii) a service discovery application. In this context, adaptation is enabled by the Gridkit reflective middleware platform.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["Nelly Bencomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bencomo:Nelly", "Paul Grace.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grace:Paul", "Carlos A.
