The outer appearance of translucent objects is a summation of the appearance of slices at all depths, where each slice is blurred by depth-dependent point spread functions (PSFs). By exploiting the difference of low-pass characteristics of depth-dependent PSFs, we develop a multi-frequency illumination method for obtaining the appearance of individual inner slices using a coaxial projector-camera setup. Specifically, by measuring the target object with varying the spatial frequency of checker patterns emitted from a projector, our method recovers inner slices via a simple linear solution method. We quantitatively evaluate accuracy of the proposed method by simulations and show qualitative recovery results using real-world scenes.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Osaka University", "Osaka University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kenichiro Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Kenichiro", "Yasuhiro Mukaigawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukaigawa:Yasuhiro", "Hiroyuki Kubo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kubo:Hiroyuki", "Yasuyuki Matsushita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsushita:Yasuyuki", "Yasushi Yagi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yagi:Yasushi"], "pages": 9}
