{"title": "Mapping parallelism to multi-cores: a machine learning based approach.", "fields": ["thread", "optimizing compiler", "task parallelism", "data parallelism", "instruction level parallelism"], "abstract": "The efficient mapping of program parallelism to multi-core processors is highly dependent on the underlying architecture. This paper proposes a portable and automatic compiler-based approach to mapping such parallelism using machine learning. It develops two predictors: a data sensitive and a data insensitive predictor to select the best mapping for parallel programs. They predict the number of threads and the scheduling policy for any given program using a model learnt off-line. By using low-cost profiling runs, they predict the mapping for a new unseen program across multiple input data sets. We evaluate our approach by selecting parallelism mapping configurations for OpenMP programs on two representative but different multi-core platforms (the Intel Xeon and the Cell processors). Performance of our technique is stable across programs and architectures. On average, it delivers above 96% performance of the maximum available on both platforms. It achieve, on average, a 37% (up to 17.5  times ) performance improvement over the OpenMP runtime default scheme on the Cell platform. Compared to two recent prediction models, our predictors achieve better performance with a significant lower profiling cost.", "citation": "Citations (193)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Zheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Zheng", "Michael F.
