We define a space of kernel structures which are built compositionally by adding and multiplying a small number of base kernels. We present a method for searching over this space of structures which mirrors the scientific discovery process. The learned structures can often decompose functions into interpretable components and enable long-range extrapolation on time-series datasets. Our structure search method outperforms many widely used kernels and kernel combination methods on a variety of prediction tasks.", "citation": "Citations (178)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["David K.
