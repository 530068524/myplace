{"title": "Computer Support for Financial Advisors and Their Clients: Co-creating an Investment Plan.", "fields": ["decision support system", "computer science", "finance", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "This paper is a workplace study of how financial advisors use their computer systems in advisory meetings with clients, with special focus on the collaborative decision-making. Observations and interviews show that the financial advisors in the study were not much helped by their computer system in visualizing and explaining financial concepts to their clients, and that not all of them trusted the system's decision support feature. Furthermore, client meetings can involve more than one client, which has further implications for the design of financial decision support.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Susanna Heyman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heyman:Susanna", "Henrik Artman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Artman:Henrik"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
