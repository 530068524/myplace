All that is necessary for the new bound is a simple adaptation of a known technique. We also show that a better algorithm exists if the input machine does not have infinite recursive loops.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Swarat Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Swarat"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2008", "pages": 11}
