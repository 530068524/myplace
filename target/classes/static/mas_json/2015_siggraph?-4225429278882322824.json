If laser-induced plasma aerial images were made available, many useful applications such as spatial aerial AR, aerial user interfaces, volumetric images could be produced. This would be a highly effective display for the expression of three-dimensional information. Volumetric expression has considerable merit because the content scale corresponds to the human body; therefore, this technology could be usefully applied to wearable materials and spatial user interactions. Further, laser focusing technology can add an additional dimension to conventional projection technology, which is designed for surface mapping, while laser focusing technology is capable of volumetric mapping. This technology can be effectively used in real-world-oriented user interfaces.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "Utsunomiya University", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "University of Tokyo", "Utsunomiya University", "University of Tsukuba", "Utsunomiya University", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "University of Tokyo", "Utsunomiya University"], "authors": ["Yoichi Ochiai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ochiai:Yoichi", "Kota Kumagai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumagai:Kota", "Takayuki Hoshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoshi:Takayuki", "Jun Rekimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rekimoto:Jun", "Satoshi Hasegawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasegawa:Satoshi", "Yoshio Hayasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayasaki:Yoshio"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
