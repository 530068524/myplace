In this paper we extend the Howgrave-Graham-Joux technique to get an algorithm with running time down to O(20.291n). An implementation shows the practicability of the technique. Another challenge is to reduce the memory requirement. We describe a constant memory algorithm based on cycle finding with running time O(20.72n); we also show a time-memory tradeoff.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of V ... in-en-Yvelines", "University of V ... elines and DGA"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Anja Becker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Becker_0001:Anja", "Jean-S\u00e9bastien Coron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coron:Jean=S=eacute=bastien", "Antoine Joux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joux:Antoine"], "pages": 22}
