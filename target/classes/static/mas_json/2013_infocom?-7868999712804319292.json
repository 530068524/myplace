In order to maximize the wavelength resource and cut down network costs associated with, e.g. OEO conversion for time-varying yet predictable traffic, we propose a novel predictive and incremental (PI) traffic grooming scheme, named PI-grooming. A conventional traffic grooming approach for fluctuated traffic is to run an algorithm that (re)assigns the traffic flows to as a few wavelengths as possible based only on the current traffic demands of these flows. This however will lead to a lot of OEO traffic. The proposed PI-grooming considers the existing flow assignment, the current traffic demands, and the expected traffic demands in the near future. We show that, compared with the conventional approach, PI-grooming can effectively minimize the amount of OEO traffic while still using a very small number of wavelengths.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "Georgia State University", "University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "conf": "infocom", "authors": ["Zilong Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Zilong", "Xiaojun Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xiaojun", "Xiujiao Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Xiujiao", "Chunming Qiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiao:Chunming"], "pages": 5}
