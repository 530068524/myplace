Recently, it has become popular to take videos of a wedding ceremony and its party. Especially, because of its length, each scene of a wedding party video needs to be indexed with each event for efficient browsing. The proposed method segments a wedding party video into scenes of events by scenario- based matching with example videos that are synthesized by combining scenes from other wedding party videos according to a scenario.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nagoya University", "Gifu Shotoku Gakuen University", "Nagoya University", "Nagoya University", "Nagoya University"], "authors": ["Kazuki Sawai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sawai:Kazuki", "Tomokazu Takahashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takahashi:Tomokazu", "Daisuke Deguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deguchi:Daisuke", "Ichiro Ide.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ide:Ichiro", "Hiroshi Murase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murase:Hiroshi"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
