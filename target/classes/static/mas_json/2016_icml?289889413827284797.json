{"title": "Fast Stochastic Algorithms for SVD and PCA: Convergence Properties and Convexity.", "fields": ["power iteration", "initialization", "computation", "convexity", "singular value decomposition"], "abstract": "We study the convergence properties of the VR-PCA algorithm introduced by (Shamir, 2015) for fast computation of leading singular vectors. We prove several new results, including a formal analysis of a block version of the algorithm, and convergence from random initialization. We also make a few observations of independent interest, such as how pre-initializing with just a single exact power iteration can significantly improve the analysis, and what are the convexity and nonconvexity properties of the underlying optimization problem.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ohad Shamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamir:Ohad"], "pages": 9}
