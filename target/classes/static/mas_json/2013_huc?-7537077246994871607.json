{"title": "Revisiting human-battery interaction with an interactive battery interface.", "fields": ["battery", "interface design", "range anxiety", "mobile phone", "context awareness"], "abstract": "Mobile phone user interfaces typically show an icon to indicate remaining battery, but not the amount of time the device can be used for, often forcing users to make faulty estimates and predictions about battery life. Here we report on two studies that capture users' experiences with a user-centered battery interface design. In Study 1, we analyze 12 participants' use of mobile phones, demonstrating that mobile phone users do not know how or what to do to extend their mobile's battery life. We further identify the information they rely on to assess battery life. In Study 2, we use this information to design, prototype and evaluate an interactive battery interface (IBI) with another 22 participants. Our findings describe how users perceive battery life and how we used their mental models of mobile phone batteries to create IBI. Lastly, we report on the users' experiences and IBI's effect on battery lifetime, showing gains of approximately 27% over the course of a day.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Denzil Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Denzil", "Eija Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Eija", "Jorge Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves:Jorge", "Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis", "Anind K.
