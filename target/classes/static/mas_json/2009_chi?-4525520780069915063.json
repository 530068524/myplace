{"title": "Of social television comes home: a field study of communication choices and practices in tv-based text and voice chat.", "fields": ["television studies", "communication studies", "social television", "mass communication", "social connectedness"], "abstract": "Social television applications have emerged as a potentially valuable convergence of media and communication, but questions remain about the utility and nature of the communication experiences they will provide. We present our study of STV3, an application that adds freeform text and voice chat capabilities to the conventional television-viewing experience. We conducted an in-depth field study of STV3 to understand how friends integrate communication through social television into their lives. Our results reveal users' choices of communication modality, their topics of conversation, and the sense of connectedness that was fostered through their use of STV3. Our findings indicate that participants overwhelmingly preferred text chat to voice chat, and that they often communicated about topics unrelated to the television content.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Motorola", "Motorola", "Motorola", "Motorola", "Motorola"], "authors": ["Elaine M.
