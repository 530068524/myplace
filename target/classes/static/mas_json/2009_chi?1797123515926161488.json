Building on our own work on everyday design and Blevis's Sustainable Interaction Design principles, we present examples from an ethnographic study of families in their homes which illustrate design-in-use: the creative and sustainable ways people appropriate and adapt designed artifacts. We claim that adopting a conception of the user as a creative everyday designer generates a new set of design principles that promote sustainable interaction design.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Ron Wakkary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wakkary:Ron", "Karen Tanenbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanenbaum:Karen"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
