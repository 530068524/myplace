The advantage of this device is that it uses phase difference control to alter the time width of pulses to generate asymmetric oscillation. It does not require altering the frequency of the vibrating motors. In this study, we investigated the influence of the pulse width generated in the device using vibrating motors on the perceptive intensity of pseudo-attraction force. From the result, the oscillation having shorter pulse widths within the range of 10\u201320 ms induced the \u201cbeing-pulled\u201d sensation more strongly.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Hidenori Hamaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamaguchi:Hidenori", "Masataka Niwa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niwa:Masataka", "Hiroyuki Iizuka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iizuka:Hiroyuki", "Hideyuki Ando.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ando:Hideyuki", "Taro Maeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maeda:Taro"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
