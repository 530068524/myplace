At the core of the system is a ranking scheme that measures how closely related an attack source is to a blacklist consumer, based on both the attacker's history and the most recent firewall log production pattern of the consumer. Our objective is to construct a customized blacklist per repository contributor that reflects the  most probable set of adresses that may attack the contributor in the near future. We view this service as a first experimental step toward a new direction in high-quality blacklist generation.", "citation": "Citations (158)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["SRI International", "SRI International", "SANS Institute, Bethesda, MD"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Jian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Jian", "Phillip A.
