It generalizes the existing literature by introducing combinatorial auctions of heterogeneous VMs, and models dynamic VM pro- visioning. Social welfare maximization under dynamic resource provisioning is proven NP-hard, and modeled with a linear inte- ger program. An efficient!-approximation algorithm is designed, with!!2.72in typical scenarios. We then employ this algorithm as a building block for designing a randomized combinatorial auction that is computationally efficient, truthful in expectation, and guarantees the same social welfare approximation factor! .A key technique in the design is to utilize a pair of tailored primal and dual LPs for exploiting the underlying packing structure of the social welfare maximization problem, to decompose its fractional solution into a convex combination of integral solutions. Empirical studies driven by Google Cluster traces verify the efficacy of the randomized auction.", "citation": "Citations (130)", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Linquan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Linquan", "Zongpeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zongpeng", "Chuan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Chuan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
