Our system is built on a set of new, distributed computer vision algorithms for image matching and 3D reconstruction, designed to maximize parallelism at each stage of the pipeline and to scale gracefully with both the size of the problem and the amount of available computation. Our experimental results demonstrate that it is now possible to reconstruct city-scale image collections with more than a hundred thousand images in less than a day.", "citation": "Citations (1,405)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Cornell University", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Cornell University", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Microsoft"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Sameer Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Sameer", "Noah Snavely.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snavely:Noah", "Ian Simon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simon:Ian", "Steven M.
