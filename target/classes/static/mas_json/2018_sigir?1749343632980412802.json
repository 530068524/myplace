However, ordinary memory networks only capture word-level information and lack the capacity for modeling complicated expressions which consist of multiple words. Targeting this problem, we propose a novel convolutional memory network which incorporates an attention mechanism. This model sequentially computes the weights of multiple memory units corresponding to multi-words. This model may capture both words and multi-words expressions in sentences for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Aston University", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Chuang Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Chuang", "Qinghong Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Qinghong", "Jiachen Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Jiachen", "Lin Gui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gui_0003:Lin", "Ruifeng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ruifeng", "Kam-Fai Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Kam=Fai"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
