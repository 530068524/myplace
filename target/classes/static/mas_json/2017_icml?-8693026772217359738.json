It has been argued that this is the case as all local minima are close to being globally optimal. We show that this is (almost) true, in fact almost all local minima are globally optimal, for a fully connected network with squared loss and analytic activation function given that the number of hidden units of one layer of the network is larger than the number of training points and the network structure from this layer on is pyramidal.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Quynh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Quynh", "Matthias Hein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hein_0001:Matthias"], "pages": 10}
