With the popularity of multi-touch tablets and styluses, sketching has become a more popular means of human-computer interaction. However, accurately recognizing sketches is rather challenging, especially when they are drawn by non-professionals. Therefore, automatic sketch understanding has attracted much research attention. To tackle the problem, we propose to segment sketch drawings before analyzing the semantic meanings of sketches for the purpose of developing a sketch-based 3D model retrieval system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Yang Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Yang", "Chi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Chi", "Shujin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Shujin", "Songhua Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Songhua", "Xiaonan Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Xiaonan", "Qiang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qiang"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
