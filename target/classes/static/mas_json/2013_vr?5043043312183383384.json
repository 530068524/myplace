This body-ownership illusion can be strengthened by animating the virtual body based on the user's motion. The sometimes poor head-tracking quality of a full-body tracker can induce simulator sickness, especially when wearing a head-mounted display, so a separate higher-quality head-tracking system is used. We discuss the issues present when integrating the data from two such tracking systems, outline principles for generating appropriate firstperson views that maintain the user's body-ownership illusion, and describe two related methods based on these principles.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Renaissance Computing Institute"], "authors": ["David Borland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borland:David"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
