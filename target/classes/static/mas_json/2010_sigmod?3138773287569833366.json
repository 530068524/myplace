{"title": "S-OLAP: an OLAP system for analyzing sequence data.", "fields": ["query optimization", "online analytical processing", "query string", "visualization", "graphical user interface"], "abstract": "The Sequence OLAP (S-OLAP) system is a novel online analytical processing system for analyzing sequence data. S-OLAP supports \"pattern-based\" grouping and aggregation on sequence data - a very powerful concept and capability that is not supported by traditional OLAP systems. It also supports several new OLAP operations that are specific to sequence data analysis. The query processing techniques documented in [1] have been implemented in our S-OLAP engine for efficient query processing. The system also provides users with a friendly graphical interface for query construction and result visualization. Query parameters can be interactively refined and the results are updated in real-time so as to facilitate the exploratory analysis of sequence data.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Chun Kit Chui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chui:Chun_Kit", "Ben Kao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kao:Ben", "Eric Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo:Eric", "David W.
