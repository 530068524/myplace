{"title": "Optimal Linear Estimation under Unknown Nonlinear Transform.", "fields": ["minimax", "estimator", "linear model", "compressed sensing", "quantization"], "abstract": "Linear regression studies the problem of estimating a model parameter \u03b2* \u2208 \u211dp, from n observations {(yi, xi)}ni=1 from linear model yi = \u2329xi, \u03b2*\u232a + \u220ai. We consider a significant generalization in which the relationship between \u2329xi, \u03b2*\u232a and yi is noisy, quantized to a single bit, potentially nonlinear, noninvertible, as well as unknown. This model is known as the single-index model in statistics, and, among other things, it represents a significant generalization of one-bit compressed sensing. We propose a novel spectral-based estimation procedure and show that we can recover \u03b2* in settings (i.e., classes of link function f) where previous algorithms fail. In general, our algorithm requires only very mild restrictions on the (unknown) functional relationship between yi and \u2329xi, \u03b2*\u232a. We also consider the high dimensional setting where \u03b2* is sparse, and introduce a two-stage nonconvex framework that addresses estimation challenges in high dimensional regimes where p \u226b n. For a broad class of link functions between \u2329xi, \u03b2*\u232a and yi, we establish minimax lower bounds that demonstrate the optimality of our estimators in both the classical and high dimensional regimes.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Princeton University", "University of Texas at Austin", "Princeton University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Xinyang Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Xinyang", "Zhaoran Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhaoran", "Constantine Caramanis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caramanis:Constantine", "Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Han"], "pages": 9}
