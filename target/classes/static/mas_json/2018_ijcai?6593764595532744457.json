{"title": "Double Auctions in Markets for Multiple Kinds of Goods.", "fields": ["mathematical economics", "common value auction", "valuation", "spectrum auction", "stock exchange"], "abstract": "Motivated by applications such as stock exchanges and spectrum auctions, there is a growing interest in mechanisms for arranging trade in two-sided markets. Existing mechanisms are either not truthful, or do not guarantee an asymptotically-optimal gain-from-trade, or rely on a prior on the traders' valuations, or operate in limited settings such as a single kind of good. We extend the random market-halving technique used in earlier works to markets with multiple kinds of goods, where traders have gross-substitute valuations. We present MIDA: a Multi Item-kind Double-Auction mechanism. It is prior-free, truthful, strongly-budget-balanced, and guarantees near-optimal gain from trade when market sizes of all goods grow to $\\infty$ at a similar rate.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ariel University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University"], "authors": ["Erel Segal-Halevi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segal=Halevi:Erel", "Avinatan Hassidim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassidim:Avinatan", "Yonatan Aumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aumann:Yonatan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
