We investigate the relationship between the surface realisation performance and the character of the input to generation, i.e. its degree of underspecification. We extend a syntactic surface realisation system, which can be trained to choose among word order variants, such that the candidate set includes active and passive variants. This allows us to study the interaction of voice and word order alternations in realistic German corpus data. We show that with an appropriately underspecified input, a linguistically informed realisation model trained to regenerate strings from the underlying semantic representation achieves 91.5% accuracy (over a baseline of 82.5%) in the prediction of the original voice.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sina Zarrie\u00df.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zarrie=szlig=:Sina", "Aoife Cahill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cahill:Aoife", "Jonas Kuhn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhn:Jonas"], "pages": 11}
