If the user objective space is rich, then we should use optimizers that can fully exploit that richness. For example, this study configures software product lines (expressed as feature maps) using various search-based software engineering methods. As we increase the number of optimization objectives, we find that methods in widespread use (e.g. NSGA-II, SPEA2) perform much worse than IBEA (Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm). IBEA works best since it makes most use of user preference knowledge. Hence it does better on the standard measures (hypervolume and spread) but it also generates far more products with 0% violations of domain constraints. Our conclusion is that we need to change our methods for search-based software engineering, particularly when studying complex decision spaces.", "citation": "Citations (159)", "departments": ["West Virginia University", "West Virginia University", "West Virginia University"], "authors": ["Abdel Salam Sayyad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sayyad:Abdel_Salam", "Tim Menzies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menzies:Tim", "Hany Ammar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ammar:Hany"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
