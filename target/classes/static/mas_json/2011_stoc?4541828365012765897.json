We model social networks with the preferential attachment model of Barabasi and Albert (Science 1999) and information spreading with the random phone call model of Karp et al. (FOCS 2000). In a recent paper (STOC 2011), we prove the following two results. (i) The random phone call model delivers a message to all nodes of graphs in the preferential attachment model within    \u0398  (  log    n  )    rounds with high probability. The best known bound so far was    O  (   log  2     n  )   . (ii) If we slightly modify the protocol so that contacts are chosen uniformly from all neighbors but the one    \u0398  (  log    n  /  log    log    n  )   , which is the diameter of the graph. This is the first time that a sublogarithmic broadcast time is proven for a natural setting. Also, this is the first time that avoiding doublecontacts reduces the run-time to a smaller order of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (124)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Saarland University", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Benjamin Doerr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doerr:Benjamin", "Mahmoud Fouz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fouz:Mahmoud", "Tobias Friedrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedrich_0001:Tobias"], "pages": 10}
