{"title": "Fast Multi-Column Sorting in Main-Memory Column-Stores.", "fields": ["sorting network", "denormalization", "external sorting", "data parallelism", "order by"], "abstract": "Sorting is a crucial operation that could be used to implement SQL operators such as GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and SQL:2003 PARTITION BY. Queries with multiple attributes in those clauses are common in real workloads. When executing queries of that kind, state-of-the-art main-memory column-stores require one round of sorting per input column. With the advent of recent fast scans and denormalization techniques, that kind of  multi-column sorting  could become a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a new technique called \"code massaging\", which manipulates the bits across the columns so that the overall sorting time can be reduced by eliminating some rounds of sorting and/or by improving the degree of SIMD data level parallelism. Empirical results show that a main-memory column-store with code massaging can achieve speedup of up to 4.7X, 4.7X, 4X, and 3.2X on TPC-H, TPC-H skew, TPC-DS, and real workload, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Wenjian Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Wenjian", "Ziqiang Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Ziqiang", "Eric Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo:Eric"], "pages": 16}
