Our user studies showed various types of page-turning actions such as flipping, grasping, and sliding by different situations or users. We categorized these actions into three categories: turn, flip through, and leaf through the page(s). Based on this categorized model, we have developed a conceptual design and prototype of an interface for an e-book reader, which enables intuitive page-turning interactions using a simple architecture in both hardware and software design. The prototype has a flexible plastic sheet with bend sensors, which is attached to a small LCD monitor to physically unite the visual display with a tangible control interface based on the natural page-turning actions as used in reading a real book. The prototype handles all three page-turning actions observed in the user studies by interpreting the bend degree of the sheet.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Kanazawa Institute of Technology", "ATR, Kyoto, Japan"], "authors": ["Taichi Tajika.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tajika:Taichi", "Tomoko Yonezawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yonezawa:Tomoko", "Noriaki Mitsunaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitsunaga:Noriaki"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
