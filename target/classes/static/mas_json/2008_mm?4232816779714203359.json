TED, a highly interactive collaborative environment, offers digital options with multiple viewpoints, enhancing the creative movement composition involved with dance choreography. A symbiotic relationship for creativity and design exists between dance artists and computer scientists as the tele-immersive environment is analyzed as a creativity and learning tool. We introduce the advancements of the interactive digital options, new interface developments, user study results, and the possibility of a computational model for human creativity through Laban Movement Analysis.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Renata M.
