It defines the basic idea of the system and describes the hardware and software in the background. It then shows how the vibration patterns, that are transmitted to the user via a wristband with two vibration motors, are calculated from the data points of the graph. The system is evaluated by a brief study with five participants. Based on this evaluation the paper suggests how the system can be improved, extended and applied in different fields of data representation.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Erik Pescara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pescara:Erik", "Maximilian Iberl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iberl:Maximilian", "Ida Rockenbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rockenbach:Ida", "Xueying Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Xueying", "Alexander Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Alexander"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
