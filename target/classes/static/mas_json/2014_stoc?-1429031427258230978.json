{"title": "Fourier PCA and robust tensor decomposition.", "fields": ["underdetermined system", "logarithm", "product distribution", "gaussian noise", "tensor"], "abstract": "Fourier PCA is Principal Component Analysis of a matrix obtained from higher order derivatives of the logarithm of the Fourier transform of a distribution. To make this algorithmic, we develop a robust tensor decomposition method; this is also of independent interest. Our main application is the first provably polynomial-time algorithm for underdetermined ICA, i.e., learning an  n  \u00d7  m  matrix  A  from observations  y  =  Ax  where  x  is drawn from an unknown product distribution with arbitrary non-Gaussian components. The number of component distributions  m  can be arbitrarily higher than the dimension  n  and the columns of  A  only need to satisfy a natural and efficiently verifiable nondegeneracy condition. As a second application, we give an alternative algorithm for learning mixtures of spherical Gaussians with linearly independent means. These results also hold in the presence of Gaussian noise.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Navin Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Navin", "Santosh Vempala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vempala:Santosh", "Ying Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao_0003:Ying"], "pages": 10}
