{"title": "Zerocash: Decentralized Anonymous Payments from Bitcoin.", "fields": ["business", "public key cryptography", "internet privacy", "cash", "ledger", "zero knowledge proof", "computer security", "digital currency", "payment"], "abstract": "Bit coin is the first digital currency to see widespread adoption. While payments are conducted between pseudonyms, Bit coin cannot offer strong privacy guarantees: payment transactions are recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which much information can be deduced. Zero coin (Miers et al., IEEE SaP 2013) tackles some of these privacy issues by unlinking transactions from the payment's origin. Yet, it still reveals payments' destinations and amounts, and is limited in functionality. In this paper, we construct a full-fledged ledger-based digital currency with strong privacy guarantees. Our results leverage recent advances in zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). First, we formulate and construct decentralized anonymous payment schemes (DAP schemes). A DAP scheme enables users to directly pay each other privately: the corresponding transaction hides the payment's origin, destination, and transferred amount. We provide formal definitions and proofs of the construction's security. Second, we build Zero cash, a practical instantiation of our DAP scheme construction. In Zero cash, transactions are less than 1 kB and take under 6 ms to verify - orders of magnitude more efficient than the less-anonymous Zero coin and competitive with plain Bit coin.", "citation": "Citations (427)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "authors": ["Eli Ben-Sasson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Sasson:Eli", "Alessandro Chiesa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiesa:Alessandro", "Christina Garman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garman:Christina", "Matthew Green.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Green_0001:Matthew", "Ian Miers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miers:Ian", "Eran Tromer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tromer:Eran", "Madars Virza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Virza:Madars"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2014", "pages": 16}
