{"title": "Joint Syntactic and Semantic Parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar.", "fields": ["glr parser", "simple lr parser", "syntactic predicate", "recursive descent parser", "lalr parser"], "abstract": "We present an approach to training a joint syntactic and semantic parser that combines syntactic training information from CCGbank with semantic training information from a knowledge base via distant supervision. The trained parser produces a full syntactic parse of any sentence, while simultaneously producing logical forms for portions of the sentence that have a semantic representation within the parser\u2019s predicate vocabulary. We demonstrate our approach by training a parser whose semantic representation contains 130 predicates from the NELL ontology. A semantic evaluation demonstrates that this parser produces logical forms better than both comparable prior work and a pipelined syntax-then-semantics approach. A syntactic evaluation on CCGbank demonstrates that the parser\u2019s dependency Fscore is within 2.5% of state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jayant Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Jayant", "Tom M.
