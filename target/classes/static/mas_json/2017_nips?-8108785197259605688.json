Since deep features eventually transition from general to specific along deep networks, a fundamental problem of multi-task learning is how to exploit the task relatedness underlying parameter tensors and improve feature transferability in the multiple task-specific layers. This paper presents Multilinear Relationship Networks (MRN) that discover the task relationships based on novel tensor normal priors over parameter tensors of multiple task-specific layers in deep convolutional networks. By jointly learning transferable features and multilinear relationships of tasks and features, MRN is able to alleviate the dilemma of negative-transfer in the feature layers and under-transfer in the classifier layer. Experiments show that MRN yields state-of-the-art results on three multi-task learning datasets.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Mingsheng Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Mingsheng", "Zhangjie Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Zhangjie", "Jianmin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Jianmin", "Philip S.
