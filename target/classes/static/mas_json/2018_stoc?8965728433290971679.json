This is the first construction of a constant-rate quantum LDPC code with an efficient decoding algorithm that can correct a linear number of random errors with a negligible failure probability. Finding codes with these properties is also motivated by Gottesman\u2019s construction of fault tolerant schemes with constant space overhead.    In order to obtain this result, we study a notion of \u03b1-percolation: for a random subset  E  of vertices of a given graph, we consider the size of the largest connected \u03b1-subset of  E , where  X  is an \u03b1-subset of  E  if | X  \u2229  E | \u2265 \u03b1 | X |.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Omar Fawzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fawzi:Omar", "Antoine Grospellier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grospellier:Antoine", "Anthony Leverrier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leverrier:Anthony"], "pages": 14}
