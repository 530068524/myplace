{"title": "Interference-Resilient Information Exchange.", "fields": ["shared secret", "schedule", "adversary", "information exchange", "channel allocation schemes"], "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient protocol for reliably exchanging information in a single-hop, multi-channel radio network subject to unpredictable interference. We model the interference by an adversary that can simultaneously disrupt up to t of the C available channels. We assume no shared secret keys or third-party infrastructure. The running time of our protocol depends on the gap between C and t: when the number of channels C =Omega(t^2), the running time is linear; when only C = t+1 channels are available, the running time is exponential. We prove that exponential-time is unavoidable in the latter case. At the core of our protocol lies a combinatorial function, possibly of independent interest, described for the first time in this paper: the multi-selector. A multi-selector generates a sequence of channel assignments for each device such that every sufficiently large subset of devices is partitioned onto distinct channels by at least one of these assignments.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "University of Liverpool", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "infocom", "authors": ["Seth Gilbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilbert:Seth", "Rachid Guerraoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerraoui:Rachid", "Dariusz R.
