Starting from an empty field, the first step to a city's growth is a small village. Electricity flows through the town, larger and larger structures grow, and a transit system is formed. Finally, an airport blooms to spread its seeds to farther places. The city is a living organism that is constantly growing. When it has fully expanded, it disperses its extra resources to create new cities.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["School of Visual Arts", "School of Visual Arts"], "authors": ["Anca Risca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Risca:Anca", "Joji Tsuruga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsuruga:Joji"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
