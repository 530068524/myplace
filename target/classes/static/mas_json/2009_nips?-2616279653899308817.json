This optimization technique can be used as a fast scoring function inside standard Stochastic Local Search (SLS) for generating posterior samples. Our second contribution is a novel framework for efficiently generating large sets of high-quality graph topologies without performing local search. This graph proposal method, which we call \"Neighborhood Fusion\" (NF), samples candidate Markov blankets at each node using sparse regression techniques. Our third contribution is a hybrid method combining the complementary strengths of NF and SLS. Experimental results in structural recovery and prediction tasks demonstrate that NF and hybrid NF/SLS out-perform state-of-the-art local search methods, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, when realistic computational limits are imposed.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Baback Moghaddam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moghaddam:Baback", "Benjamin M.
