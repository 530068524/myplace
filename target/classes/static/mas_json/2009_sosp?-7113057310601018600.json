{"title": "RouteBricks: exploiting parallelism to scale software routers.", "fields": ["multi core processor", "router", "exploit", "one armed router", "core router"], "abstract": "We revisit the problem of scaling software routers, motivated by recent advances in server technology that enable high-speed parallel processing--a feature router workloads appear ideally suited to exploit. We propose a software router architecture that parallelizes router functionality both across multiple servers and across multiple cores within a single server. By carefully exploiting parallelism at every opportunity, we demonstrate a 35Gbps parallel router prototype; this router capacity can be linearly scaled through the use of additional servers. Our prototype router is fully programmable using the familiar Click/Linux environment and is built entirely from off-the-shelf, general-purpose server hardware.", "citation": "Citations (640)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Lancaster University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Mihai Dobrescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobrescu:Mihai", "Norbert Egi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egi:Norbert", "Katerina J.
