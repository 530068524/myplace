Data sources, much to analysts' dismay, are too often plagued with incompleteness, making business analytics over the data difficult. Data entries with incomplete values are ignored, making some analytic queries fail to accurately describe how an organization is performing. We introduce a principled way of performing value imputation on missing values, allowing a user to choose a correct value after viewing possible values and why they were inferred. We achieve this by turning our data into a graph network and performing link prediction on nodes of interest using the belief propagation algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Christina Christodoulakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Christodoulakis:Christina", "Christos Faloutsos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faloutsos:Christos", "Ren\u00e9e J.
