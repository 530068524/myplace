First, we present new bounds on the information complexity of AUGMENTED-INDEX. In contrast to analogous results for INDEX by Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen [J. ACM, 2009], we have to overcome the significant technical challenge that protocols for AUGMENTED-INDEX may violate the ``rectangle property'' due to the inherent input sharing. Second, we use these bounds to resolve an open problem of Magniez, Mathieu and Nayak [STOC, 2010] on the multi-pass complexity of recognizing Dyck languages. This results in a natural separation between the standard multi-pass model and the multi-pass model that permits reverse passes. Third, we present the first passive memory checkers that verify the interaction transcripts of priority queues, stacks, and double-ended queues. We obtain tight upper and lower bounds for these problems, thereby addressing an important sub-class of the memory checking framework of Blum et al. [Algorithmica, 1994].", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Dartmouth College", "AT&T", "Dartmouth College", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Amit Chakrabarti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakrabarti:Amit", "Graham Cormode.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cormode:Graham", "Ranganath Kondapally.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kondapally:Ranganath", "Andrew McGregor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGregor_0001:Andrew"], "pages": 10}
