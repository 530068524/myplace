A current research trend in belief change is concerned with representation theorems tailored to fragments of logic, in particular Horn logic. Hereby, the goal is to guarantee that the result of the change operations stays within the fragment under consideration. While several such results have been obtained for Horn revision and Horn contraction, merging of Horn theories has been neglected so far. In this article, we provide a novel representation theorem for Horn merging by strengthening the standard merging postulates. Moreover, we present concrete Horn merging operators satisfying all postulates.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "University of Sydney", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Adrian Haret.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haret:Adrian", "Stefan R\u00fcmmele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=uuml=mmele:Stefan", "Stefan Woltran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woltran:Stefan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
