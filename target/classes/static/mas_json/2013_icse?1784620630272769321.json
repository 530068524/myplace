We do not have a strong idea about whether such algorithms are useful to guide human developers. We deployed a bug prediction algorithm across Google, and found no identifiable change in developer behavior. Using our experience, we provide several characteristics that bug prediction algorithms need to meet in order to be accepted by human developers and truly change how developers evaluate their code.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Google", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Google"], "authors": ["Chris Lewis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lewis_0002:Chris", "Zhongpeng Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhongpeng", "Caitlin Sadowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadowski:Caitlin", "Xiaoyan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaoyan", "Rong Ou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ou:Rong", "E.
