{"title": "JBSE: a symbolic executor for Java programs with complex heap inputs.", "fields": ["java bytecode", "binary heap", "binomial heap", "heap", "executor"], "abstract": "We present the Java Bytecode Symbolic Executor ( JBSE ), a symbolic executor for Java programs that operates on complex heap inputs.  JBSE  implements both the novel Heap EXploration Logic (HEX), a symbolic execution approach to deal with heap inputs, and the main state-of-the-art approaches that handle data structure constraints expressed as either executable programs ( repOk  methods) or declarative specifications.  JBSE  is the first symbolic executor specifically designed to deal with programs that operate on complex heap inputs, to experiment with the main state-of-the-art approaches, and to combine different decision procedures to explore possible synergies among approaches for handling symbolic data structures.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Milano-Bicocca", "University of Milano-Bicocca", "University of Lugano"], "conf": "sigsoft", "authors": ["Pietro Braione.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braione:Pietro", "Giovanni Denaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denaro:Giovanni", "Mauro Pezz\u00e8.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pezz=egrave=:Mauro"], "pages": 5}
