However, programmers need to spend considerable efforts on acceleration, without knowing how sustainable the employed programming models, languages and tools are. To tackle this challenge, we propose and demonstrate a new runtime system called HT r OP that is able to automatically generate and execute OpenCL code from sequential CPU code. HT r OP transforms suitable data-parallel loops into independent OpenCL-typical work-items and handles concrete calls to these devices through a mix of library components and application-specific OpenCL host code. Computational hotspots are identified and can be offloaded to different resources (CPU, GPGPU and Xeon Phi). We demonstrate the potential of HT r OP on a broad set of applications and are able to improve the performance by 4.3X on average.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Paderborn", "University of Paderborn", "University of Paderborn", "University of Paderborn"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Heinrich Riebler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riebler:Heinrich", "Gavin Vaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaz:Gavin", "Tobias Kenter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kenter:Tobias", "Christian Plessl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plessl:Christian"], "pages": 2}
