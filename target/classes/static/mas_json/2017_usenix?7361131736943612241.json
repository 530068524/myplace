Our approach consists in allowing full concurrency when processing local updates and using a deferred local serialisation procedure before shipping updates to remote datacenters. This strategy allows to implement inexpensive mechanisms to ensure system consistency requirements while avoiding intrusive effects on update operations, a major performance limitation of previous systems. We have implemented our approach as a variant of Riak KV. Our extensive evaluation shows that we outperform sequencer-based approaches by almost an order of magnitude in the maximum achievable throughput. Furthermore, unlike previous sequencer-free solutions, our approach reaches nearly optimal remote update visibility latencies without limiting throughput.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Concordia University"], "authors": ["Chathuri Gunawardhana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gunawardhana:Chathuri", "Manuel Bravo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bravo:Manuel", "Lu\u00eds E.
