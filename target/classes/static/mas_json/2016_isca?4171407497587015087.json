While published designs easily give an order of magnitude improvement over general-purpose hardware, few look beyond an initial implementation. This paper presents Minerva, a highly automated co-design approach across the algorithm, architecture, and circuit levels to optimize DNN hardware accelerators. Compared to an established fixed-point accelerator baseline, we show that fine-grained, heterogeneous datatype optimization reduces power by 1.5\u00d7; aggressive, inline predication and pruning of small activity values further reduces power by 2.0\u00d7; and active hardware fault detection coupled with domain-aware error mitigation eliminates an additional 2.7\u00d7 through lowering SRAM voltages. Across five datasets, these optimizations provide a collective average of 8.1\u00d7 power reduction over an accelerator baseline without compromising DNN model accuracy. Minerva enables highly accurate, ultra-low power DNN accelerators (in the range of tens of milliwatts), making it feasible to deploy DNNs in power-constrained IoT and mobile devices.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Brandon Reagen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reagen:Brandon", "Paul N.
