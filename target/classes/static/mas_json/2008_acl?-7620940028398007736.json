{"title": "Summarizing Emails with Conversational Cohesion and Subjectivity.", "fields": ["sentence", "pagerank", "two graph", "automatic summarization", "cosine similarity"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of summarizing email conversations. We first build a sentence quotation graph that captures the conversation structure among emails. We adopt three cohesion measures: clue words, semantic similarity and cosine similarity as the weight of the edges. Second, we use two graph-based summarization approaches, Generalized ClueWordSummarizer and PageRank, to extract sentences as summaries. Third, we propose a summarization approach based on subjective opinions and integrate it with the graph-based ones. The empirical evaluation shows that the basic clue words have the highest accuracy among the three cohesion measures. Moreover, subjective words can significantly improve accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "Department of C ... sity of British", "Department of C ... sity of British"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Giuseppe Carenini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carenini:Giuseppe", "Raymond T.
