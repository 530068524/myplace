Grapevine conducts large scale data analysis on the social media collective, distilling and extracting information in real time. It aims to track entities and stories of interest in millions of blog posts, thousands of tweets, news items, etc., daily. Grapevine facilitates the interactive exploration of content, allowing users to discover interesting or surprising stories, optionally narrowed down on a specific demographic of interest (e.g. \"What are Torontonians talking about on blogs?\", \"What are popular stories across news sources in Canada?\", \"What are financiers in Texas blogging about today?\"). Stories of interest can be explored in a variety of ways, such as modifying their scope, obtaining related content (blog posts, news, etc), and examining their temporal evolution.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "AT&T Labs"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Albert Angel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angel:Albert", "Nick Koudas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koudas:Nick", "Nikos Sarkas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkas:Nikos", "Divesh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Divesh"], "pages": 4}
