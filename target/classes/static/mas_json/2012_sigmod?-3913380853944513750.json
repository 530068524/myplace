{"title": "SOFIA SEARCH: a tool for automating related-work search.", "fields": ["ranking", "computer science", "data mining", "database", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "When working on a new project, researchers need to devote a significant amount of time and effort to surveying the relevant literature. This is required in order to gain expertise, evaluate the significance of their work and gain useful insights about a particular scientific domain. While necessary, relevant-work search is also a time-consuming and arduous process, requiring the continuous participation of the user. In this work, we introduce Sofia Search, a tool that fully automates the search and retrieval of the literature related to a topic. Given a seed of papers submitted by the user, Sofia Search searches the Web for candidate related papers, evaluates their relevance to the seed and downloads them for the user. The tool also provides modules for the evaluation and ranking of authors and papers, in the context of the retrieved papers. In the demo, we will demonstrate the functionality of our tool, by allowing users to use it via a simple and intuitive interface.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Boston University", "Boston University", "Boston University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Behzad Golshan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golshan:Behzad", "Theodoros Lappas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lappas:Theodoros", "Evimaria Terzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terzi:Evimaria"], "pages": 4}
