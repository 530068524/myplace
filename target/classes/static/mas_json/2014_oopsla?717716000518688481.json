{"title": "i3QL: language-integrated live data views.", "fields": ["partial evaluation", "scratch", "reactive programming", "relational algebra", "scala"], "abstract": "An incremental computation updates its result based on a change to its input, which is often an order of magnitude faster than a recomputation from scratch. In particular, incrementalization can make expensive computations feasible for settings that require short feedback cycles, such as interactive systems, IDEs, or (soft) real-time systems.   This paper presents i3QL, a general-purpose programming language for specifying incremental computations. i3QL provides a declarative SQL-like syntax and is based on incremental versions of operators from relational algebra, enriched with support for general recursion. We integrated i3QL into Scala as a library, which enables programmers to use regular Scala code for non-incremental subcomputations of an i3QL query and to easily integrate incremental computations into larger software projects. To improve performance, i3QL optimizes user-defined queries by applying algebraic laws and partial evaluation. We describe the design and implementation of i3QL and its optimizations, demonstrate its applicability, and evaluate its performance.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Ralf Mitschke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitschke:Ralf", "Sebastian Erdweg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erdweg:Sebastian", "Mirko K\u00f6hler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=hler:Mirko", "Mira Mezini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mezini:Mira", "Guido Salvaneschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salvaneschi:Guido"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2014", "pages": 16}
