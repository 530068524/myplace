{"title": "AutoCardSorter: designing the information architecture of a web site using latent semantic analysis.", "fields": ["latent semantic analysis", "quality of results", "hierarchical clustering", "card sorting", "information architecture"], "abstract": "In this paper, we describe an innovative tool that supports the design and evaluation of the information architecture of a Web site. The tool uses Latent Semantic Analysis and hierarchical clustering algorithms to provide optimal information navigation schemes in an automated manner. The proposed, tool-based, approach addresses the problem of reasonable content structuring, which established techniques such as card sorting also address. A real world case study depicted substantial effectiveness gain, without expense in the quality of results. We argue that such an approach could facilitate information-rich applications design, like most Web sites, by reducing time and resources required.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Patras", "University of Patras", "University of Patras"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christos Katsanos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katsanos:Christos", "Nikolaos K.
