{"title": "In case you missed it: benefits of attendee-shared annotations for non-attendees of remote meetings.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "indexation", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "Corporate meetings are increasingly being held remotely using web technologies. With such remote meetings being recorded and made available after the fact, there is a pressing need for tools to access and utilize these recordings efficiently. Our work explores the utility of using annotations generated by meeting attendees to meet this need. We conducted a controlled lab study to evaluate the benefits of sharing annotations. Attendee-created annotations were shared with non-attendees to assist them on typical information retrieval tasks. Results indicate that (a) non-attendees given access to shared annotations performed about as well as attendees provided with their own and shared annotations, (b) non-attendees were more confident in their responses when they used shared annotations as access cues into the recording than when they directly skimmed the video, and (c) attendees utilized shared annotations more than their own, with similar success and confidence as using their own annotations.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Mukesh Nathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nathan:Mukesh", "Mercan Topkara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Topkara:Mercan", "Jennifer C.
