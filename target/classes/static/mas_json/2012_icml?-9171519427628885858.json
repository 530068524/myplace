Geometric smoothing techniques are developed to deal with degenerate clusters. To allow for cluster models based on exponential families with overcomplete representations, Bregman divergences are developed for nondifferentiable convex functions.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Matus Telgarsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Telgarsky:Matus", "Sanjoy Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Sanjoy"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
