{"title": "Padding for orthogonality: Efficient subspace authentication for network coding.", "fields": ["symmetric key algorithm", "padding", "network packet", "linear network coding", "public key cryptography"], "abstract": "Network coding provides a promising alternative to traditional store-and-forward transmission paradigm. However, due to its information-mixing nature, network coding is notoriously susceptible to pollution attacks: a single polluted packet can end up corrupting bunches of good ones. Existing authentication mechanisms either incur high computation/bandwidth overheads, or cannot resist the tag pollution proposed recently. This paper presents a novel idea termed \u201cpadding for orthogonality\u201d for network coding authentication. Inspired by it, we design a public-key based signature scheme and a symmetric-key based MAC scheme, which can both effectively contain pollution attacks at forwarders. In particular, we combine them to propose a unified scheme termed MacSig, the first hybrid-key cryptographic approach to network coding authentication. It can thwart both normal pollution and tag pollution attacks in an efficient way. Simulative results show that our MacSig scheme has a low bandwidth overhead, and a verification process 2\u20134 times faster than typical signature-based solutions in some circumstances.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "California Institute of Technology", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Peng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0011:Peng", "Yixin Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yixin", "Chuang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chuang", "Hongyi Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Hongyi", "Albert Wasef.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wasef:Albert", "Xuemin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xuemin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
