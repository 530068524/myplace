{"title": "Rationalisation of Profiles of Abstract Argumentation Frameworks: Extended Abstract.", "fields": ["management science", "rationalisation", "argumentation framework", "pure mathematics", "argumentation theory"], "abstract": "We review a recently introduced model in which each of a number of agents is endowed with an abstract argumentation framework reflecting her individual views regarding a given set of arguments. A question arising in this context is whether the diversity of views observed in such a situation is consistent with the assumption that every individual argumentation framework is induced by a combination of, first, some basic factual information and, second, the personal preferences of the agent concerned. We treat this question of rationalisability of a profile as an algorithmic problem and identify tractable and intractable cases. This is useful for understanding what types of profiles can reasonably be expected to occur in a multiagent system.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University", "Paris Descartes University", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Paris", "Paris Descartes University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["St\u00e9phane Airiau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Airiau:St=eacute=phane", "Elise Bonzon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonzon:Elise", "Ulle Endriss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Endriss:Ulle", "Nicolas Maudet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maudet:Nicolas", "Julien Rossit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossit:Julien"], "pages": 5}
