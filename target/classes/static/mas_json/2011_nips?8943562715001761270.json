{"title": "Fast and Balanced: Efficient Label Tree Learning for Large Scale Object Recognition.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "fractal tree index", "cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition", "incremental decision tree", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach to efficiently learn a label tree for large scale classification with many classes. The key contribution of the approach is a technique to simultaneously determine the structure of the tree and learn the classifiers for each node in the tree. This approach also allows fine grained control over the efficiency vs accuracy trade-off in designing a label tree, leading to more balanced trees. Experiments are performed on large scale image classification with 10184 classes and 9 million images. We demonstrate significant improvements in test accuracy and efficiency with less training time and more balanced trees compared to the previous state of the art by Bengio et al.", "citation": "Citations (160)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stony Brook University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Jia Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Jia", "Sanjeev Satheesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satheesh:Sanjeev", "Alexander C.
