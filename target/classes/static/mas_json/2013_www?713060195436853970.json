Web automation, a process of automating browsing actions on behalf of the user, has the potential to bridge the divide between the ways sighted and people with vision impairment access the Web; specifically, it can enable the latter to breeze through web browsing tasks that beforehand were slow, hard, or even impossible to accomplish. Typical web automation requires that the user record a macro, a sequence of browsing steps, so that these steps can be automated in the future by replaying the macro. However, for people with vision impairment, automation with macros is not usable.   In this paper, we propose a novel model-based approach that facilitates web automation without having to either record or replay macros. Using the past browsing history and the current web page as the browsing context, the proposed model can predict the most probable browsing actions that the user can do. The model construction is \"unsupervised\". More importantly, the model is continuously and incrementally updated as history evolves, thereby, ensuring the predictions are not \"outdated\".   We also describe a novel interface that lets the user focus on the objects associated with the most probable predicted browsing steps (e.g., clicking links and filling out forms), and facilitates automatic execution of the selected steps. A study with 19 blind participants showed that the proposed approach dramatically reduced the interaction time needed to accomplish typical browsing tasks, and the user interface was perceived to be much more usable than the standard screen-reading interfaces.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Yury Puzis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Puzis:Yury", "Yevgen Borodin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borodin:Yevgen", "Rami Puzis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Puzis:Rami", "I.
