{"title": "Deepauth: in-situ authentication for smartwatches via deeply learned behavioural biometrics.", "fields": ["biometrics", "password", "inference", "recurrent neural network", "smartwatch"], "abstract": "This paper proposes DeepAuth, an in-situ authentication framework that leverages the unique motion patterns when users entering passwords as behavioural biometrics. It uses a deep recurrent neural network to capture the subtle motion signatures during password input, and employs a novel loss function to learn deep feature representations that are robust to noise, unseen passwords, and malicious imposters even with limited training data. DeepAuth is by design optimised for resource constrained platforms, and uses a novel split-RNN architecture to slim inference down to run in real-time on off-the-shelf smartwatches. Extensive experiments with real-world data show that DeepAuth outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly in both authentication performance and cost, offering real-time authentication on a variety of smartwatches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Warwick", "University of Oxford", "University of Warwick", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation"], "authors": ["Chris Xiaoxuan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Chris_Xiaoxuan", "Bowen Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Bowen", "Peijun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Peijun", "Hongkai Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Hongkai", "Yiran Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yiran", "Andrew Markham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markham:Andrew", "Niki Trigoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trigoni:Niki"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
