We explore natural on-person interfaces using SAR. Spatial Augmented Reality on Person (SARP) leverages self-based psychological effects such as Self-Referential Encoding (SRE) and ownership by intertwining augmented body interactions with the self. Applications based on SARP could provide powerful tools in education, health awareness, and medical visualization. The goal of this paper is to explore benefits and limitations of generating ownership and SRE using the SARP technique. We implement a hardware platform which provides a Spatial Augmented Game Environment to allow SARP experimentation. We test a STEM educational game entitled `Augmented Anatomy' designed for our proposed platform with experts and a student population in US and China. Results indicate that learning of anatomy on-self does appear correlated with increased interest in STEM and is rated more engaging, effective and fun than textbook-only teaching of anatomical structures.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of South Florida", "University of South Florida"], "authors": ["Adrian S.
