{"title": "Robust Nonparametric Regression with Metric-Space Valued Output.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "metric space", "pointwise", "nonparametric regression", "estimator"], "abstract": "Motivated by recent developments in manifold-valued regression we propose a family of nonparametric kernel-smoothing estimators with metric-space valued output including several robust versions. Depending on the choice of the output space and the metric the estimator reduces to partially well-known procedures for multi-class classification, multivariate regression in Euclidean space, regression with manifold-valued output and even some cases of structured output learning. In this paper we focus on the case of regression with manifold-valued input and output. We show pointwise and Bayes consistency for all estimators in the family for the case of manifold-valued output and illustrate the robustness properties of the estimators with experiments.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Saarland University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Matthias Hein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hein_0001:Matthias"], "pages": 9}
