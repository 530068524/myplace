Existing MIML approaches have been found useful in many applications; however, most of them can only handle moderatesized data. To efficiently handle large data sets, we propose the MIMLfast approach, which first constructs a low-dimensional subspace shared by all labels, and then trains label specific linear models to optimize approximated ranking loss via stochastic gradient descent. Although the MIML problem is complicated, MIML fast is able to achieve excellent performance by exploiting label relations with shared space and discovering sub-concepts for complicated labels. Experiments show that the performance of MIMLfast is highly competitive to state-of-the-art techniques, whereas its time cost is much less; particularly, on a data set with 30K bags and 270K instances, where none of existing approaches can return results in 24 hours, MIMLfast takes only 12 minutes. Moreover, our approach is able to identify the most representative instance for each label, and thus providing a chance to understand the relation between input patterns and output semantics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Sheng-Jun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Sheng=Jun", "Wei Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0008:Wei", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
