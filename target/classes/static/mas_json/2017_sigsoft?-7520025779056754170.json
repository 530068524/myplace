Recent studies addressed this challenge in both static and dynamic scenarios for small and medium size software projects. The increasing trend of cloud based software solutions (large scale software projects) needs agility not only for sustainable maintenance but also for in time and within budget completion. Therefore, this paper formulates software project scheduling problem (SPSP) as an optimization problem under uncertainties and dynamics for hybrid scRUmP software model. In this regard, a mathematical model is constructed with five objectives as project duration, task fragmentation, robustness, cost, and stability.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Birmingham"], "authors": ["Natasha Nigar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nigar:Natasha"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
