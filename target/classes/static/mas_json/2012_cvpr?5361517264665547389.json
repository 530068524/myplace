We bring this to bear on computer vision problems that utilize low-dimensional subspaces, demonstrating that subsampling can improve computation speed while still allowing for accurate subspace learning. We present GRASTA, Grassmannian Robust Adaptive Subspace Tracking Algorithm, an online algorithm for robust subspace estimation from randomly subsampled data. We consider the specific application of background and foreground separation in video, and we assess GRASTA on separation accuracy and computation time. In one benchmark video example [16], GRASTA achieves a separation rate of 46.3 frames per second, even when run in MATLAB on a personal laptop.", "citation": "Citations (258)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "City University of New York"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jun He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0006:Jun", "Laura Balzano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balzano:Laura", "Arthur Szlam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szlam:Arthur"], "pages": 8}
