{"title": "Classification with Low Rank and Missing Data.", "fields": ["subspace topology", "linear classifier", "missing data", "classifier", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We consider classification and regression tasks where we have missing data and assume that the (clean) data resides in a low rank subspace. Finding a hidden subspace is known to be computationally hard. Nevertheless, using a nonproper formulation we give an efficient agnostic algorithm that classifies as good as the best linear classifier coupled with the best low-dimensional subspace in which the data resides. A direct implication is that our algorithm can linearly (and non-linearly through kernels) classify provably as well as the best classifier that has access to the full data.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad", "Roi Livni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Livni:Roi", "Yishay Mansour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mansour:Yishay"], "pages": 10}
