These proofs rely crucially on a decomposition of runs successively refined by Mayr, Kosaraju, and Lambert, which appears rather magical, and for which no complexity upper bound is known. We first offer a justification for this decomposition technique, by showing that it computes the ideal decomposition of the set of runs, using the natural embedding relation between runs as well quasi ordering. In a second part, we apply recent results on the complexity of termination thanks to well quasi orders and well orders to obtain a cubic Ackermann upper bound for the decomposition algorithms, thus providing the first known upper bounds for general VAS reach ability.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["L'Abri", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Leroux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leroux:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Sylvain Schmitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmitz:Sylvain"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
