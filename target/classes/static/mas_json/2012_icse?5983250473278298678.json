But what if the runtime environment - a legacy Business Process Execution (BPE) platform - had to be replaced with a new solution? Several migration aspects must be taken into account. (1) Process models from the old BPE platform have to be converted to the target process definition language on the target BPE platform. (2) Existing Business Process Management (BPM) applications must be integrated via new BPE platform interfaces. (3) Process instances and process instance data state must be migrated. For each of these points an appropriate migration strategy must be chosen. This paper describes the migration methodology which was applied for the BPE platform renewal in Credit Suisse.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Credit Suisse", "Credit Suisse", "Credit Suisse"], "authors": ["Tarmo Ploom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ploom:Tarmo", "Stefan Scheit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scheit:Stefan", "Axel Glaser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glaser:Axel"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
