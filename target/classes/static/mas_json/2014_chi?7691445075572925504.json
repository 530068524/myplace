{"title": "Mechanical force redistribution: enabling seamless, large-format, high-accuracy surface interaction.", "fields": ["force platform", "large format", "redistribution", "resistive touchscreen", "input device"], "abstract": "We present Mechanical Force Redistribution (MFR): a method of sensing which creates an anti-aliased image of forces applied to a surface. This technique mechanically focuses the force from a surface onto adjacent discrete forcels (force sensing cells) by way of protrusions (small bumps or pegs), allowing for high-accuracy interpolation between adjacent discrete forcels. MFR works with any force transducing technique or material, including force variable resistive inks, piezoelectric materials and capacitive force plates. MFR sensors can be tiled such that the signal is continuous across contiguous tiles. By minimizing active materials and computational complexity, MFR makes large-format interactive walls, collaborative tabletops and high-resolution floor tiles possible and economically feasible.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["New York University", "Tactonic Techno ... d City, NY, USA", "Tactonic Techno ... d City, NY, USA", "Tactonic Techno ... d City, NY, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alex M.
