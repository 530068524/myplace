They are best considered as typical multiscale features, where the principal lines can be represented at a larger scale while the wrinkles at a smaller scale. Motivated by the success of coding-based palmprint recognition methods, this paper investigates a compact representation of multiscale palm line orientation features, and proposes a novel method called the sparse multiscale competitive code (SMCC). The SMCC method first defines a filter bank of second derivatives of Gaussians with different orientations and scales, and then uses the l 1 -norm sparse coding to obtain a robust estimation of the multiscale orientation field. Finally, a generalized competitive code is used to encode the dominant orientation. Experimental results show that the SMCC achieves higher verification accuracy than state-of-the-art palmprint recognition methods, yet uses a smaller template size than other multiscale methods.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wangmeng Zuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuo:Wangmeng", "Zhouchen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhouchen", "Zhenhua Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo_0001:Zhenhua", "David Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:David"], "pages": 8}
