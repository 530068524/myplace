This\npaper initiates the study of communication networks whose\nconfigurations can be verified fast, namely in polynomial time.\nIn particular, we show that in communication networks based\non prefix rewriting, which include MPLS networks, important\nnetwork properties such as reachability, loop-freedom, and transparency,\ncan be verified efficiently, even in the presence of\nfailures. This enables a fast what-if analysis, addressing a major\nconcern of network administrators: while configuring and testing\nnetwork policies for a fully functional network is challenging,\nensuring policy compliance in the face of (possibly multiple)\nfailures, is almost impossible for human administrators. At the\nheart of our approach lies an interesting connection to the theory\nof prefix rewriting systems, a subfield of language and automata\ntheory.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Vienna", "Aalborg University"], "authors": ["Stefan Schmid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmid_0001:Stefan", "Jir\u00ed Srba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srba:Jir=iacute="], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
