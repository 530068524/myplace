Most of these semantics rely on the notion of a repair, defined as an inclusion-maximal subset of the facts (ABox) which is consistent with the ontology (TBox). In this paper, we study variants of two popular inconsistency-tolerant semantics obtained by replacing classical repairs by various types of preferred repair. We analyze the complexity of query answering under the resulting semantics, focusing on the lightweight logic DL-LiteR. Unsurprisingly, query answering is intractable in all cases, but we nonetheless identify one notion of preferred repair, based upon priority levels, whose data complexity is \"only\" coNP-complete. This leads us to propose an approach combining incomplete tractable methods with calls to a SAT solver. An experimental evaluation of the approach shows good scalability on realistic cases.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud", "University of Rennes"], "authors": ["Meghyn Bienvenu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bienvenu:Meghyn", "Camille Bourgaux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bourgaux:Camille", "Fran\u00e7ois Goasdou\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goasdou=eacute=:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
