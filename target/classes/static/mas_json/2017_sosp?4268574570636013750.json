{"title": "Verifying a high-performance crash-safe file system using a tree specification.", "fields": ["design rule for camera file system", "versioning file system", "unix file types", "file control block", "file system fragmentation"], "abstract": "DFSCQ is the first file system that (1) provides a precise specification for fsync and fdatasync, which allow applications to achieve high performance and crash safety, and (2) provides a machine-checked proof that its implementation meets this specification. DFSCQ's specification captures the behavior of sophisticated optimizations, including log-bypass writes, and DFSCQ's proof rules out some of the common bugs in file-system implementations despite the complex optimizations.   The key challenge in building DFSCQ is to write a specification for the file system and its internal implementation without exposing internal file-system details. DFSCQ introduces a metadata-prefix specification that captures the properties of fsync and fdatasync, which roughly follows the behavior of Linux ext4. This specification uses a notion of tree sequences---logical sequences of file-system tree states---for succinct description of the possible states after a crash and to describe how data writes can be reordered with respect to metadata updates. This helps application developers prove the crash safety of their own applications, avoiding application-level bugs such as forgetting to invoke fsync on both the file and the containing directory.   An evaluation shows that DFSCQ achieves 103 MB/s on large file writes to an SSD and durably creates small files at a rate of 1,618 files per second. This is slower than Linux ext4 (which achieves 295 MB/s for large file writes and 4,977 files/s for small file creation) but much faster than two recent verified file systems, Yggdrasil and FSCQ. Evaluation results from application-level benchmarks, including TPC-C on SQLite, mirror these microbenchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Google", "University of California, Berkeley", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Databricks"], "authors": ["Haogang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Haogang", "Tej Chajed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chajed:Tej", "Alex Konradi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konradi:Alex", "Stephanie Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Stephanie", "Atalay Ileri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ileri:Atalay", "Adam Chlipala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chlipala:Adam", "M.
