{"title": "Routine classification through sequence alignment.", "fields": ["sequence alignment", "gsm", "computer vision", "mobile phone", "bluetooth"], "abstract": "In this paper we draw a methodological connection between human routine classification and the sequence alignment problem in bioinformatics. We first observe that human days exhibit important time shifts and therefore align them for comparison prior to classification. Our technique is evaluated on bimodal data including GSM and Bluetooth information collected on mobile phones. The introduction of new alignment features is found to significantly improve the accuracy of routine classification.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Driss Choujaa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choujaa:Driss", "Naranker Dulay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dulay:Naranker"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
