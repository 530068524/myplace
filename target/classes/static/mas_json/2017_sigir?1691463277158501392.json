{"title": "Learning Max-Margin GeoSocial Multimedia Network Representations for Point-of-Interest Suggestion.", "fields": ["web service", "point of interest", "feature learning", "mobile device", "social relation"], "abstract": "With the rapid development of mobile devices, point-of-interest (POI) suggestion has become a popular online web service, which provides attractive and interesting locations to users. In order to provide interesting POIs, many existing POI recommendation works learn the latent representations of users and POIs from users' past visiting POIs, which suffers from the sparsity problem of POI data. In this paper, we consider the problem of POI suggestion from the viewpoint of learning geosocial multimedia network representations. We propose a novel max-margin metric geosocial multimedia network representation learning framework by exploiting users' check-in behavior and their social relations. We then develop a random-walk based learning method with max-margin metric network embedding. We evaluate the performance of our method on a large-scale geosocial multimedia network dataset and show that our method achieves the best performance than other state-of-the-art solutions.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Tencent", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Zhou Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zhou", "Qifan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Qifan", "Hanqing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hanqing", "Min Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0007:Min", "Jun Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao_0001:Jun", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
