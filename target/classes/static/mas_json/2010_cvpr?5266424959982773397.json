{"title": "An approach to vectorial total variation based on geometric measure theory.", "fields": ["vector valued function", "invariant", "geometric measure theory", "scalar", "image restoration"], "abstract": "We analyze a previously unexplored generalization of the scalar total variation to vector-valued functions, which is motivated by geometric measure theory. A complete mathematical characterization is given, which proves important invariance properties as well as existence of solutions of the vectorial ROF model. As an important feature, there exists a dual formulation for the proposed vectorial total variation, which leads to a fast and stable minimization algorithm. The main difference to previous approaches with similar properties is that we penalize across a common edge direction for all channels, which is a major theoretical advantage. Experiments show that this leads to a significiantly better restoration of color edges in practice.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Bastian Goldl\u00fccke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldl=uuml=cke:Bastian", "Daniel Cremers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cremers:Daniel"], "pages": 7}
