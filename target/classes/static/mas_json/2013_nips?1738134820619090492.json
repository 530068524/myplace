Our model calculates the density of a datapoint as the product of one-dimensional conditionals modeled using mixture density networks with shared parameters. RNADE learns a distributed representation of the data, while having a tractable expression for the calculation of densities. A tractable likelihood allows direct comparison with other methods and training by standard gradient-based optimizers. We compare the performance of RNADE on several datasets of heterogeneous and perceptual data, finding it outperforms mixture models in all but one case.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"], "authors": ["Benigno Uria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uria:Benigno", "Iain Murray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murray_0001:Iain", "Hugo Larochelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larochelle:Hugo"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
