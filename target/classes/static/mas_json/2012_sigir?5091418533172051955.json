Relatively few studies have systematically analyzed the motivation to create and share content, especially from the perspective of a common user. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of user posting behavior on a popular social media website, Twitter. Specifically, we assume that user behavior is mainly influenced by three factors: breaking news, posts from social friends and user's intrinsic interest, and propose a mixture latent topic model to combine all these factors. We evaluated our model on a large-scale Twitter dataset from three different perspectives: the perplexity of held-out content, the performance of predicting retweets and the quality of generated latent topics. The results were encouraging, our model clearly outperformed its competitors.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Zhiheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zhiheng", "Yang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yang", "Yao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yao", "Qing Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Qing"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
