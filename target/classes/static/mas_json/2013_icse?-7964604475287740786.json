Conversely, in this paper we investigate the possibility to apply software refactoring techniques to textual content. As a procedural program is composed of functions calling each other, a document can be modeled as content fragments connected each other through links. Inspired by software engineering refactoring strategies, we propose an approach for refactoring wiki content. The approach has been applied to the EMF category of Eclipsepedia with encouraging results.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Sannio", "University of Sannio", "University of Sannio", "University of Sannio"], "authors": ["Lerina Aversano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aversano:Lerina", "Gerardo Canfora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canfora:Gerardo", "Giuseppe De Ruvo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruvo:Giuseppe_De", "Maria Tortorella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tortorella:Maria"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
