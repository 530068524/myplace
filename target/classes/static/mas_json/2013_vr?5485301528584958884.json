This system can transmit information about the existence and surface textures of objects in remote locations. The system consists of a conjugated haptic sensor and display. The sensor on the robot's finger detects the pressure, vibration, and temperature of a remote object, and the display provides above information on the operator's finger. Based on this information, the operator can understand what he/she is touching and whether its surface is hard or soft, cold or hot, and smooth or rough. With the use of our system, the operator can recognize the difference between objects such as silk and denim.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University", "University of Tokyo", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Tadatoshi Kurogi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurogi:Tadatoshi", "Masano Nakayama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakayama:Masano", "Katsunari Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Katsunari", "Sho Kamuro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamuro:Sho", "Charith Lasantha Fernando.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fernando:Charith_Lasantha", "Masahiro Furukawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furukawa:Masahiro", "Kouta Minamizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minamizawa:Kouta", "Susumu Tachi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tachi:Susumu"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
