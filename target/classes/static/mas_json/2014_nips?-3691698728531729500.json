We derive the first sample-efficient polynomial-time estimator for high-dimensional spherical Gaussian mixtures. Based on intuitive spectral reasoning, it approximates mixtures of k spherical Gaussians in d-dimensions to within l1 distance e using O(dk9(log2 d)/e4) samples and Ok,e(d3 log5 d) computation time. Conversely, we show that any estimator requires \u03a9(dk/e2) samples, hence the algorithm's sample complexity is nearly optimal in the dimension. The implied time-complexity factor Ok,e is exponential in k, but much smaller than previously known.\n\nWe also construct a simple estimator for one-dimensional Gaussian mixtures that uses O(k/e2) samples and O((k/e)3k+1) computation time.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ananda Theertha Suresh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suresh:Ananda_Theertha", "Alon Orlitsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orlitsky:Alon", "Jayadev Acharya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acharya:Jayadev", "Ashkan Jafarpour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jafarpour:Ashkan"], "pages": 9}
