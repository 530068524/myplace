{"title": "Traitor tracing with constant size ciphertext.", "fields": ["key", "ciphertext", "security parameter", "traitor tracing", "collusion"], "abstract": "A traitor tracing system enables a publisher to trace a pirate decryption box to one of the secret keys used to create the box. We present a traitor tracing system where ciphertext size is \"constant,\" namely independent of the number of users in the system and the collusion bound. A ciphertext in our system consists of only two elements where the length of each element depends only on the security parameter. The down side is that private-key size is quadratic in the collusion bound. Our construction is based on recent constructions for fingerprinting codes.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan", "Moni Naor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naor:Moni"], "pages": 10}
