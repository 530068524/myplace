Inspired by the recent successes of search-based structured prediction, we introduce a new framework for structured prediction called HC-Search. Given a structured input, the framework uses a search procedure guided by a learned heuristic H to uncover high quality candidate outputs and then uses a separate learned cost function C to select a final prediction among those outputs. We can decompose the regret of the overall approach into the loss due to H not leading to high quality outputs, and the loss due to C not selecting the best among the generated outputs. Guided by this decomposition, we minimize the overall regret in a greedy stagewise manner by first training H to quickly uncover high quality outputs via imitation learning, and then training C to correctly rank the outputs generated via H according to their true losses. Experiments on several benchmark domains show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Janardhan Rao Doppa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doppa:Janardhan_Rao", "Alan Fern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fern:Alan", "Prasad Tadepalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tadepalli:Prasad"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
