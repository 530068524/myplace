While there has been significant amount of research done on different rootkits, we describe a new type of rootkit that is kernel-independent \u2013 i.e., no aspect of the kernel is modified and no code is added to the kernel address space to install the rootkit. In this work, we present PIkit \u2013 Processor-Interconnect rootkit that exploits the vulnerable hardware features within multi-socket servers that are commonly used in datacenters and high-performance computing. In particular, PIkit exploits the DRAM address mapping table structure that determines the destination node of a memory request packet in the processorinterconnect. By modifying this mapping table appropriately, PIkit enables access to victim\u2019s memory address region without proper permission. Once PIkit is installed, only user-level code or payload is needed to carry out malicious activities. The malicious payload mostly consists of memory read and/or write instructions that appear like \u201cnormal\u201d user-space memory accesses and it becomes very difficult to detect such malicious payload. We describe the design and implementation of PIkit on both an AMD and an Intel x86 multi-socket servers that are commonly used. We discuss different malicious activities possible with PIkit and limitations of PIkit, as well as possible software and hardware solutions to PIkit.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["WonJun Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:WonJun", "Hyunwoo Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Hyunwoo", "Junhong Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Junhong", "Eunsoo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Eunsoo", "Yongdae Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Yongdae", "John Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:John"], "pages": 15}
