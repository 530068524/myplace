{"title": "SensEmbed: Learning Sense Embeddings for Word and Relational Similarity.", "fields": ["polysemy", "semantic similarity", "popularity", "semantic network", "conflation"], "abstract": "Word embeddings have recently gained considerable popularity for modeling words in different Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks including semantic similarity measurement. However, notwithstanding their success, word embeddings are by their very nature unable to capture polysemy, as different meanings of a word are conflated into a single representation. In addition, their learning process usually relies on massive corpora only, preventing them from taking advantage of structured knowledge. We address both issues by proposing a multifaceted approach that transforms word embeddings to the sense level and leverages knowledge from a large semantic network for effective semantic similarity measurement. We evaluate our approach on word similarity and relational similarity frameworks, reporting state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.", "citation": "Citations (137)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ignacio Iacobacci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iacobacci:Ignacio", "Mohammad Taher Pilehvar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilehvar:Mohammad_Taher", "Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto"], "pages": 11}
