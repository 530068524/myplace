{"title": "A Dual-Criticality Memory Controller (DCmc): Proposal and Evaluation of a Space Case Study.", "fields": ["uniform memory access", "interleaved memory", "memory bank", "extended memory", "memory refresh"], "abstract": "Multicore Dual-Criticality systems comprise two types of applications, each with a different criticality level. In the space domain these types are referred as payload and control applications, which have high-performance and real time requirements respectively. In order to control the interaction (contention) among payload and control applications in the access to the main memory, reaching the goals of high bandwidth for the former and guaranteed timing bounds for the latter, we propose a Dual-Criticality memory controller (DCmc). DCmc virtually divides memory banks into real-time and high-performance banks, deploying a different request scheduler policy to each bank type, which facilitates achieving both goals. Our evaluation with a multicore cycle-accurate simulator and a real space case study shows that DCmc enables deriving tight WCET estimates, regardless of the co-running payload applications, hence effectively isolating the effect of contention in the access to memory. DCmc also enables payload applications exploiting memory locality, which is needed for high performance.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Barcelona Super ... arcelona, Spain", "Barcelona Super ... arcelona, Spain", "Barcelona Super ... arcelona, Spain", "Univ.
