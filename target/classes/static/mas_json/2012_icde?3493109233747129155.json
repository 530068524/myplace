However, a lot of evaluation metrics are around, that are not always concordant nor easily interpretable in judging the agreement of a pair of clusterings. Here, we provide a tool to visually support the assessment of clustering results in comparing multiple clusterings. Along the way, the suitability of a couple of clustering comparison measures can be judged in different scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "authors": ["Elke Achtert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achtert:Elke", "Sascha Goldhofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldhofer:Sascha", "Hans-Peter Kriegel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kriegel:Hans=Peter", "Erich Schubert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schubert:Erich", "Arthur Zimek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimek:Arthur"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
