{"title": "Optimal graph learning with partial tags and multiple features for image and video annotation.", "fields": ["data point", "training set", "exploit", "supervised learning", "annotation"], "abstract": "In multimedia annotation, due to the time constraints and the tediousness of manual tagging, it is quite common to utilize both tagged and untagged data to improve the performance of supervised learning when only limited tagged training data are available. This is often done by adding a geometrically based regularization term in the objective function of a supervised learning model. In this case, a similarity graph is indispensable to exploit the geometrical relationships among the training data points, and the graph construction scheme essentially determines the performance of these graph-based learning algorithms. However, most of the existing works construct the graph empirically and are usually based on a single feature without using the label information. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised annotation approach by learning an optimal graph (OGL) from multi-cues (i.e., partial tags and multiple features) which can more accurately embed the relationships among the data points. We further extend our model to address out-of-sample and noisy label issues. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show the consistent superiority of OGL over state-of-the-art methods by up to 12% in terms of mean average precision.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Trento", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Trento", "University of Trento"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Lianli Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Lianli", "Jingkuan Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Jingkuan", "Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Yan Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan_0002:Yan", "Nicu Sebe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebe:Nicu", "Heng Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Heng_Tao"], "pages": 9}
