{"title": "TouchTokens: Guiding Touch Patterns with Passive Tokens.", "fields": ["grasp", "formative assessment", "security token", "human computer interaction", "simulation"], "abstract": "TouchTokens make it possible to easily build interfaces that combine tangible and gestural input using passive tokens and a regular multi-touch surface. The tokens constrain users' grasp, and thus, the relative spatial configuration of fingers on the surface, theoretically making it possible to design algorithms that can recognize the resulting touch patterns. We performed a formative user study to collect and analyze touch patterns with tokens of varying shape and size. The analysis of this pattern collection showed that individual users have a consistent grasp for each token, but that this grasp is user-dependent and that different grasp strategies can lead to confounding patterns. We thus designed a second set of tokens featuring notches that constrain users' grasp. Our recognition algorithm can classify the resulting patterns with a high level of accuracy (>95%) without any training, enabling application designers to associate rich touch input vocabularies with command triggers and parameter controls.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rafael Morales Gonzalez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonzalez:Rafael_Morales", "Caroline Appert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Appert:Caroline", "Gilles Bailly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bailly:Gilles", "Emmanuel Pietriga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietriga:Emmanuel"], "pages": 14}
