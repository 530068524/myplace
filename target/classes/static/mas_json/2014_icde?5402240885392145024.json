{"title": "A demonstration of MNTG - A web-based road network traffic generator.", "fields": ["tiger", "traffic generation model", "download", "extensibility", "data visualization"], "abstract": "This demo presents Minnesota Traffic Generator (MNTG); an extensible web-based road network traffic generator. MNTG enables its users to generate traffic data at any arbitrary road networks with different traffic generators. Unlike existing traffic generators that require a lot of time/effort to install, configure, and run, MNTG is a web service with a user-friendly interface where users can specify an arbitrary spatial region, select a traffic generator, and submit their traffic generation request. Once the traffic data is generated by MNTG, users can then download and/or visualize the generated data. MNTG can be extended to support: (1) various traffic generators. It is already shipped with the two most common traffic generators, Brinkhoff and BerlinMOD, but other generators can be easily added. (2) various road network sources. It is shipped with U.S. Tiger files and OpenStreetMap, but other sources can be also added. A beta version of MNTG is launched at: http://mntg.cs.umn.edu.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Mohamed F.
