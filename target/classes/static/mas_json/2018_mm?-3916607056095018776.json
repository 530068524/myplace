To this end, we introduce a novel depth structure preserving scene image generation network (DSP-GAN), which favors a hierarchical and heterogeneous architecture, for the purpose of depth structure preserving scene generation. The main trunk of the proposed infrastructure is built on a Hawkes point process that models the spatial dependency between different depth layers. Within each layer generative adversarial sub-networks are trained collaboratively to generate realistic scene components, conditioned on the layer information produced by the point process. We experiment our model on a sub-set of SUNdataset with annotated scene images and demonstrate that our models are capable of generating depth-realistic natural scene image.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Peking University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Peking University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "mm", "authors": ["Wendong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wendong", "Feng Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Feng", "Bingbing Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Bingbing", "Lingyu Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Lingyu", "Yichao Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Yichao", "Jingwei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jingwei", "Xiaokang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiaokang"], "pages": 10}
