{"title": "Multithreaded global address space communication techniques for gyrokinetic fusion applications on ultra-scale platforms.", "fields": ["parallel language", "partitioned global address space", "multithreading", "thread", "instruction set"], "abstract": "We present novel parallel language constructs for the communication intensive part of a magnetic fusion simulation code. The focus of this work is the shift phase of charged particles of a tokamak simulation code in toroidal geometry. We introduce new hybrid PGAS/OpenMP implementations of highly optimized hybrid MPI/OpenMP based communication kernels. The hybrid PGAS implementations use an extension of standard hybrid programming techniques, enabling the distribution of high communication work loads of the underlying kernel among OpenMP threads. Building upon lightweight one-sided CAF (Fortran 2008) communication techniques, we also show the benefits of spreading out the communication over a longer period of time, resulting in a reduction of bandwidth requirements and a more sustained communication and computation overlap. Experiments on up to 130560 processors are conducted on the NERSC Hopper system, which is currently the largest HPC platform with hardware support for one-sided communication and show performance improvements of 52% at highest concurrency.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Cray", "Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory", "Cray"], "authors": ["Robert Preissl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Preissl:Robert", "Nathan Wichmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wichmann:Nathan", "Bill Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Bill", "John Shalf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalf:John", "St\u00e9phane Ethier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ethier:St=eacute=phane", "Alice E.
