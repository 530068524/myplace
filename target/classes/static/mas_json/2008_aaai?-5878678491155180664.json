{"title": "Multiagent Graph Coloring: Pareto Efficiency, Fairness and Individual Rationality.", "fields": ["complete coloring", "fractional coloring", "greedy coloring", "factor critical graph", "list coloring"], "abstract": "We consider a multiagent extension of single-agent graph coloring. Multiple agents hold disjoint autonomous subgraphs of a global graph, and every color used by the agents in coloring the graph has associated cost. In this multi agent graph coloring scenario, we seek a minimum legal coloring of the global graph's vertices, such that the coloring is also Pareto efficient, socially fair, and individual rational. We analyze complexity of individual-rational solutions in special graph classes where classical coloring algorithms are known. Multiagent graph coloring has application to a wide variety of multi agent coordination problems, including multiagent scheduling.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Yaad Blum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blum:Yaad", "Jeffrey S.
