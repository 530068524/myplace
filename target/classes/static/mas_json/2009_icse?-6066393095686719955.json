In this paper, we investigate the impact of using richer program profiles such as path profiles on the effectiveness of bug isolation. We describe a statistical debugging tool called HOLMES that isolates bugs by finding paths that correlate with failure. We also present an adaptive version of HOLMES that uses iterative, bug-directed profiling to lower execution time and space overheads. We evaluate HOLMES using programs from the SIR benchmark suite and some large, real-world applications. Our results indicate that path profiles can help isolate bugs more precisely by providing more information about the context in which bugs occur. Moreover, bug-directed profiling can efficiently isolate bugs with low overheads, providing a scalable and accurate alternative to sparse random sampling.", "citation": "Citations (261)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Trishul M.
