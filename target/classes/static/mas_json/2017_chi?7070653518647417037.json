{"title": "Interactive Vectorization.", "fields": ["vectorization", "multimedia", "computer vision", "vector graphics"], "abstract": "Vectorization turns photographs into vector art. Manual vectorization, where the artist traces over the image by hand, requires skill and time. On the other hand, automatic approaches allow users to generate a result by setting a few global parameters. However, global settings often leave too much detail/complexity in some parts of the image while missing important details in others. We propose interactive vectorization tools that offer more local control than automatic systems, but are more powerful and high-level than simple curve editing. Our system enables novices to vectorize images significantly faster than even experts with state-of-the-art tools.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jun Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Jun", "Holger Winnem\u00f6ller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winnem=ouml=ller:Holger", "Wilmot Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wilmot", "Stephen Schiller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiller:Stephen"], "pages": 11}
