However, to this date there have been no useful tools for researchers to understand which datasets have been used for what purpose, or in what prior work. Instead, they have to manually browse through papers to find the suitable datasets and their corresponding URLs, which is laborious and inefficient. To better aid the dataset discovery process, and provide a better understanding of how and where datasets have been used, we propose a framework to effectively identify datasets within the scientific corpus. The key technical challenges are identification of datasets, and discovery of the association between a dataset and the URLs where they can be accessed. Based on this, we have built a user friendly web-based search interface for users to conveniently explore the dataset-paper relationships, and find relevant datasets and their properties.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "AT&T", "AT&T", "AT&T", "AT&T"], "authors": ["Meiyu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Meiyu", "Srinivas Bangalore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bangalore:Srinivas", "Graham Cormode.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cormode:Graham", "Marios Hadjieleftheriou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hadjieleftheriou:Marios", "Divesh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Divesh"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
