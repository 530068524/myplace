We observe that although object and background are very likely to contain similar colors in natural images, it is much less probable that they share similar color configurations. Motivated by this observation, we propose a local color pattern model to characterize the color configuration in a robust way. Additionally, we propose an edge profile model to modulate the contrast of the image, which enhances edges along object boundaries and attenuates edges inside object or background. The local color pattern model and edge model are integrated in a graph-cut framework. Higher accuracy and improved robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated through experimental comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Microsoft", "Xiamen University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jingyu Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Jingyu", "Qiong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Qiong", "Fang Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Fang", "Qiying Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Qiying", "Changshui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Changshui", "Luc J.
