{"title": "SENSeTREAM: enhancing online live experience with sensor-federated video stream using animated two-dimensional code.", "fields": ["live streaming", "user experience design", "streams", "data stream mining", "new media"], "abstract": "We propose a novel technique that aggregates multiple sensor streams generated by totally different types of sensors into a visually enhanced video stream. This paper shows major features of SENSeTREAM and demonstrates enhancement of user experience in an online live music event. Since SENSeTREAM is a video stream with sensor values encoded in a two-dimensional graphical code, it can transmit multiple sensor data streams while maintaining their synchronization. A SENSeTREAM can be transmitted via existing live streaming services, and can be saved into existing video archive services. We have implemented a prototype SENSeTREAM generator and deployed it to an online live music event. Through the pilot study, we confirmed that SENSeTREAM works with popular streaming services, and provide a new media experience for live performances. We also indicate future direction for establishing visual stream aggregation and its applications.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Takuro Yonezawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yonezawa:Takuro", "Masaki Ogawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogawa:Masaki", "Yutaro Kyono.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kyono:Yutaro", "Hiroki Nozaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nozaki:Hiroki", "Jin Nakazawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakazawa:Jin", "Osamu Nakamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakamura:Osamu", "Hideyuki Tokuda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tokuda:Hideyuki"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 5}
