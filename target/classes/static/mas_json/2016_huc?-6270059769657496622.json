Taking an experimental approach, we systematically explore the dynamics of user engagement with a smartphone through three different studies. Specifically, to understand the feasibility of detecting user engagement from mobile context, we first assess an EEG artifact with 10 users and observe a strong correlation between automatically detected engagement scores and user's subjective perception of engagement. Grounded on this result, we model a set of application level features derived from smartphone usage of 10 users to detect engagement of a usage session using a Random Forest classifier. Finally, we apply this model to train a variety of contextual factors acquired from smartphone usage logs of 130 users to predict user engagement using an SVM classifier with a  F  1 -Score of 0.82. Our experimental results highlight the potential of mobile contexts in designing engagement-aware applications and provide guidance to future explorations.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "University College London", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Akhil Mathur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mathur:Akhil", "Nicholas D.
