In this paper, we propose an efficient and adaptive keyword search method, called EASE, for indexing and querying large collections of heterogenous data. To achieve high efficiency in processing keyword queries, we first model unstructured, semi-structured and structured data as graphs, and then summarize the graphs and construct graph indices instead of using traditional inverted indices. We propose an extended inverted index to facilitate keyword-based search, and present a novel ranking mechanism for enhancing search effectiveness. We have conducted an extensive experimental study using real datasets, and the results show that EASE achieves both high search efficiency and high accuracy, and outperforms the existing approaches significantly.", "citation": "Citations (500)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "National University of Singapore", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Guoliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Guoliang", "Beng Chin Ooi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ooi:Beng_Chin", "Jianhua Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jianhua", "Jianyong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jianyong", "Lizhu Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Lizhu"], "pages": 12}
