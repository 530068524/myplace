A key insight in our approach is to reduce the tasks of content selection (\"what to say\") and surface realization (\"how to say\") into a common parsing problem. We define a probabilistic context-free grammar that describes the structure of the input (a corpus of database records and text describing some of them) and represent it compactly as a weighted hypergraph. The hypergraph structure encodes exponentially many derivations, which we rerank discriminatively using local and global features. We propose a novel decoding algorithm for finding the best scoring derivation and generating in this setting. Experimental evaluation on the Atis domain shows that our model outperforms a competitive discriminative system both using BLEU and in a judgment elicitation study.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ioannis Konstas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konstas:Ioannis", "Mirella Lapata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lapata:Mirella"], "pages": 10}
