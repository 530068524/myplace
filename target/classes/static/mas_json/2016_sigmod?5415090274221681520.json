This paper introduces a novel problem called the  best region search  ( BRS ) problem and provides efficient solutions to it. Given a set O of spatial objects, a submodular monotone aggregate score function, and the size a x b of a query rectangle, the  BRS  problem aims to find a x b rectangular region such that the  aggregate score  of the spatial objects inside the region is maximized. This problem is fundamental to support several real-world applications such as  most influential region  search (eg. the best location for a signage to attract most audience) and  most diversified region  search (eg. region with most diverse facilities). We propose an efficient algorithm called  SliceBRS  to find the exact answer to the  BRS  problem. Furthermore, we propose an approximate solution called  CoverBRS  and prove that the answer found by it is bounded by a constant. Our experimental study with real-world datasets and applications demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "National Chiao Tung University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kaiyu Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Kaiyu", "Gao Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Gao", "Sourav S.
