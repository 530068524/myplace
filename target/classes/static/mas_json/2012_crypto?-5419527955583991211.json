{"title": "Black-Box Constructions of Composable Protocols without Set-Up.", "fields": ["black box", "oblivious transfer", "commitment scheme", "computation", "universal composability"], "abstract": "We present the first black-box construction of a secure multi-party computation protocol that satisfies a meaningful notion of concurrent security in the plain model without any set-up, and without assuming an honest majority. Moreover, our protocol relies on the minimal assumption of the existence of a semi-honest OT protocol, and our security notion \"UC with super-polynomial helpers\" Canetti et al, STOC'10 is closed under universal composition, and implies super-polynomial-time simulation security.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Boston University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Huijia Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Huijia", "Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 18}
