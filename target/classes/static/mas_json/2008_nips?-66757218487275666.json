Combining approximate Bayesian inference and natural image statistics with high-performance numerical computation, we propose the first Bayesian experimental design framework for this problem of high relevance to clinical and brain research. Our solution requires large-scale approximate inference for dense, non-Gaussian models. We propose a novel scalable variational inference algorithm, and show how powerful methods of numerical mathematics can be modified to compute primitives in our framework. Our approach is evaluated on raw data from a 3T MR scanner.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Matthias W.
