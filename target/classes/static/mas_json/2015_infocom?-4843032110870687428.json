However, a fundamental understanding is still lacking, with respect to its advantage over half-duplex in multi-cell wireless networks with contending links. In this paper, we establish a spatial stochastic framework to analyze the mean network throughput gain from full-duplex, and pinpoint the key factors that determine the gain. Our framework extends classical stochastic geometry analysis with a new tool-set, which allows us to model a trade-off between the benefit from concurrent full-duplex transmissions and the loss of spatial reuse, particularly for CSMA-based transmitters with random backoff. The analysis derives closed-form expressions for the full-duplex gain as a function of link distance, interference range, network density, and carrier sensing schemes. It can be easily applied to guide the deployment choices during the early stage of network planning.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Shu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shu", "Vignesh Venkateswaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkateswaran:Vignesh", "Xinyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xinyu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
