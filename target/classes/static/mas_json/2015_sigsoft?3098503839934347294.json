{"title": "iTrace: enabling eye tracking on software artifacts within the IDE to support software engineering tasks.", "fields": ["program comprehension", "eye tracking", "java", "software system", "plug in"], "abstract": "The paper presents iTrace, an Eclipse plugin that implicitly records developers' eye movements while they work on change tasks. iTrace is the first eye tracking environment that makes it possible for researchers to conduct eye tracking studies on large software systems. An overview of the design and architecture is presented along with features and usage scenarios. iTrace is designed to support a variety of eye trackers. The design is flexible enough to record eye movements on various types of software artifacts (Java code, text/html/xml documents, diagrams), as well as IDE user interface elements. The plugin has been successfully used for software traceability tasks and program comprehension tasks. iTrace is also applicable to other tasks such as code summarization and code recommendations based on developer eye movements.
