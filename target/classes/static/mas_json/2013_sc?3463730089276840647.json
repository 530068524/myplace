{"title": "On fast parallel detection of strongly connected components (SCC) in small-world graphs.", "fields": ["distance hereditary graph", "modular decomposition", "implicit graph", "graph product", "partial k tree"], "abstract": "Detecting strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph is a fundamental graph analysis algorithm that is used in many science and engineering domains. Traditional approaches in parallel SCC detection, however, show limited performance and poor scaling behavior when applied to large  real-world  graph instances. In this paper, we investigate the shortcomings of the conventional approach and propose a series of extensions that consider the fundamental properties of  real-world  graphs, e.g. the  small-world  property. Our scalable implementation offers excellent performance on diverse,  small-world  graphs resulting in a 5.01x to 29.41x parallel speedup over the optimal sequential algorithm with 16 cores and 32 hardware threads.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Sungpack Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Sungpack", "Nicole C.
