Albedo estimation has far reaching applications in various computer vision tasks like illumination-insensitive matching, shape recovery, etc. We extend the formulation proposed in [3] that assumes face in known pose and present an algorithm that can perform albedo estimation from a single image even when pose information is inaccurate. 3D pose of the input face image is obtained as a byproduct of the algorithm. The proposed approach utilizes class-specific statistics of faces to iteratively improve albedo and pose estimates. Illustrations and experimental results are provided to show the effectiveness of the approach. We highlight the usefulness of the method for the task of matching faces across variations in pose and illumination. The facial pose estimates obtained are also compared against ground truth.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Soma Biswas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biswas:Soma", "Rama Chellappa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chellappa:Rama"], "pages": 8}
