{"title": "Fusing noisy fingerprints with distance bounds for indoor localization.", "fields": ["wireless", "machine learning", "measurement uncertainty", "dead reckoning", "convex optimization"], "abstract": "Fusing fingerprints with mutual distance information potentially improves indoor localization accuracy. Such distance information may be spatial (e.g., via inter-node measurement) or temporal (e.g., via dead reckoning). Previous approaches on distance fusion often require exact distance measurement, assume the knowledge of distance distribution, or apply narrowly to some specific sensing technology or scenario. Due to random signal fluctuation, wireless fingerprints are inherently noisy and distance cannot be exactly measured. We hence propose Wi-Dist, a highly accurate indoor localization framework fusing noisy fingerprints with uncertain mutual distances (given by their bounds). Wi-Dist is a generic framework applicable to a wide range of sensors (peer-assisted, INS, etc.) and wireless fingerprints (Wi-Fi, RFID, CSI, etc.). It achieves low errors by a convex-optimization formulation which jointly considers distance bounds and only the first two moments of measured fingerprint signals. We implement Wi-Dist, and conduct extensive simulation and experimental studies based on Wi-Fi in our international airport and university campus. Our results show that Wi-Dist achieves significantly better accuracy than other state-of-the-art schemes (often by more than 40%).", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Suining He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Suining", "S.-H.
