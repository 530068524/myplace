{"title": "Automated domain-specific C verification with mbeddr.", "fields": ["intelligent verification", "runtime verification", "high level verification", "verification", "software verification"], "abstract": "When verifying C code, two major problems must be addressed. One is the specification of the verified systems properties, the other one is the construction of the verification environment. Neither C itself, nor existing C verification tools, offer the means to efficiently specify application domain-level properties and environments for verification. These two shortcomings hamper the usability of C verification, and limit its adoption in practice. In this paper we introduce an approach that addresses both problems and results in user-friendly and practically usable C verification. The novelty of the approach is the combination of domain-specific language engineering and C verification. We apply the approach in the domain of state-based software, using mbeddr and CBMC. We validate the implementation with an example from the Pacemaker Challenge, developing a functionally verified, lightweight, and deployable cardiac pulse generator. The approach itself is domain-independent.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Fortiss Institu ... Munich, Germany", "independent/ite ... ttgart, Germany", "Fortiss Institu ...
