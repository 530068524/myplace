We propose a method for learning label embeddings (similar to error-correcting output codes (ECOCs)) to model the similarity between labels within a nearest neighbor framework. The learned ECOCs and nearest neighbor information are used to provide conditional probability estimates. We apply these estimates to the problem of acoustic modeling for speech recognition. We demonstrate significant improvements in terms of word error rate (WER) on a lecture recognition task over a state-of-the-art baseline GMM model.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Natasha Singh-Miller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh=Miller:Natasha", "Michael Collins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collins_0001:Michael"], "pages": 9}
