{"title": "Recovery of Corrupted Multiple Kernels for Clustering.", "fields": ["variable kernel density estimation", "string kernel", "tree kernel", "kernel embedding of distributions", "multiple kernel learning"], "abstract": "Kernel-based methods, such as kernel k-means and kernel PCA, have been widely used in machine learning tasks. The performance of these methods critically depends on the selection of kernel functions; however, the challenge is that we usually do not know what kind of kernels is suitable for the given data and task in advance; this leads to research on multiple kernel learning, i.e. we learn a consensus kernel from multiple candidate kernels. Existing multiple kernel learning methods have difficulty in dealing with noises. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning a robust yet low-rank kernel for clustering tasks. We observe that the noises of each kernel have specific structures, so we can make full use of them to clean multiple input kernels and then aggregate them into a robust, low-rank consensus kernel. The underlying optimization problem is hard to solve and we will show that it can be solved via alternating minimization, whose convergence is theoretically guaranteed. Experimental results on several benchmark data sets further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Peng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Peng", "Liang Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Liang", "Lei Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Lei", "Hanmo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hanmo", "Yi-Dong Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yi=Dong"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
