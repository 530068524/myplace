Our work focuses on using an alternative representation of syntactically regular MWEs, which cap- tures their syntactic internal structure. We obtain a system with comparable perfor- mance to that of previous works on this dataset, but which predicts both syntactic dependencies and the internal structure of MWEs. This can be useful for capturing the various degrees of semantic composi- tionality of MWEs.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Marie Candito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Candito:Marie", "Matthieu Constant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Constant:Matthieu"], "pages": 11}
