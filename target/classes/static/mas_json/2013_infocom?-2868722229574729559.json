Several polynomial-time approximation algorithms have been designed previously in the literature. Their best known performance ratio is O(r ln n) where r is the link radius of the sensor network and n is the number of sensors. In this paper, we will present two polynomial-time approximation algorithms. The first one is a random algorithm, with probability 1 - e, producing an approximation solution with performance ratio O(log 3  n log log n), independent from r. The second one is a deterministic approximation with performance ratio O(r), independent from n.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Renmin University of China", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Lidong Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Lidong", "Hongwei Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Hongwei", "Weili Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Weili", "Deying Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Deying", "Jing Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Jing", "Wonjun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wonjun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 8}
