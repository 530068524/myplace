{"title": "In-domain Relation Discovery with Meta-constraints via Posterior Regularization.", "fields": ["small set", "regularization", "inference", "single domain", "lexicography"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach to discovering relations and their instantiations from a collection of documents in a single domain. Our approach learns relation types by exploiting meta-constraints that characterize the general qualities of a good relation in any domain. These constraints state that instances of a single relation should exhibit regularities at multiple levels of linguistic structure, including lexicography, syntax, and document-level context. We capture these regularities via the structure of our probabilistic model as well as a set of declaratively-specified constraints enforced during posterior inference. Across two domains our approach successfully recovers hidden relation structure, comparable to or outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we find that a small set of constraints is applicable across the domains, and that using domain-specific constraints can further improve performance.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Harr Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Harr", "Edward Benson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benson:Edward", "Tahira Naseem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naseem:Tahira", "Regina Barzilay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barzilay:Regina"], "pages": 11}
