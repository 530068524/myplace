{"title": "B4: experience with a globally-deployed software defined wan.", "fields": ["openflow", "software deployment", "software defined networking", "server", "traffic engineering"], "abstract": "We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of B4, a private WAN connecting Google's data centers across the planet. B4 has a number of unique characteristics: i) massive bandwidth requirements deployed to a modest number of sites, ii) elastic traffic demand that seeks to maximize average bandwidth, and iii) full control over the edge servers and network, which enables rate limiting and demand measurement at the edge.   These characteristics led to a Software Defined Networking architecture using OpenFlow to control relatively simple switches built from merchant silicon. B4's centralized traffic engineering service drives links to near 100% utilization, while splitting application flows among multiple paths to balance capacity against application priority/demands. We describe experience with three years of B4 production deployment, lessons learned, and areas for future work.", "citation": "Citations (1,522)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Sushant Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Sushant", "Alok Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Alok", "Subhasree Mandal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mandal:Subhasree", "Joon Ong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ong:Joon", "Leon Poutievski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poutievski:Leon", "Arjun Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Arjun", "Subbaiah Venkata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkata:Subbaiah", "Jim Wanderer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wanderer:Jim", "Junlan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Junlan", "Min Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Min", "Jon Zolla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zolla:Jon", "Urs H\u00f6lzle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=lzle:Urs", "Stephen Stuart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stuart:Stephen", "Amin Vahdat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vahdat:Amin"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
