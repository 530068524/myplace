{"title": "SketchParse: Towards Rich Descriptions for Poorly Drawn Sketches using Multi-Task Hierarchical Deep Networks.", "fields": ["deep learning", "sketch", "parsing", "annotation", "multi task learning"], "abstract": "The ability to semantically interpret hand-drawn line sketches, although very challenging, can pave way for novel applications in multimedia. We propose SKETCHPARSE, the first deep-network architecture for fully automatic parsing of freehand object sketches. SKETCHPARSE is configured as a two-level fully convolutional network. The first level contains shared layers common to all object categories. The second level contains a number of expert sub-networks. Each expert specializes in parsing sketches from object categories which contain structurally similar parts. Effectively, the two-level configuration enables our architecture to scale up efficiently as additional categories are added. We introduce a router layer which (i) relays sketch features from shared layers to the correct expert (ii) eliminates the need to manually specify object category during inference. To bypass laborious part-level annotation, we sketchify photos from semantic object-part image datasets and use them for training. Our architecture also incorporates object pose prediction as a novel auxiliary task which boosts overall performance while providing supplementary information regarding the sketch. We demonstrate SKETCHPARSE's abilities (i) on two challenging large-scale sketch datasets (ii) in parsing unseen, semantically related object categories (iii) in improving fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval. As a novel application, we also outline how SKETCHPARSE's output can be used to generate caption-style descriptions for hand-drawn sketches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarvadevabhatla:Ravi_Kiran", "Isht Dwivedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dwivedi:Isht", "Abhijat Biswas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biswas:Abhijat", "Sahil Manocha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manocha:Sahil", "Venkatesh Babu R......http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=:Venkatesh_Babu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
