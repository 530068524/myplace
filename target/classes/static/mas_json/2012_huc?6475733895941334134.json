However, people's locations change frequently and the rankings of people change dynamically too, which makes ranking on graphs a challenging work. To address this challenge, we propose the LBSNRank algorithm on graphs with nodes whose contents change dynamically. To validate our algorithm on real datasets, we have crawled and analyzed a dataset from the Dianping website. Experiments on this real dataset show that our LBSNRank algorithm performs better than traditional personalized PageRank in efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Zhaoyan Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Zhaoyan", "Dianxi Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Dianxi", "Quanyuan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Quanyuan", "Huining Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Huining", "Hua Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Hua"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 8}
