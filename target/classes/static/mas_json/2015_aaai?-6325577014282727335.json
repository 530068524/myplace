{"title": "Elections with Few Voters: Candidate Control Can Be Easy.", "fields": ["machine learning", "computational complexity theory", "mathematics", "voting", "parameterized complexity", "artificial intelligence", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We study the computational complexity of candidate control in elections with few voters (that is, we take the number of voters as a parameter). We consider both the standard scenario of adding and deleting candidates, where one asks if a given candidate can become a winner (or, in the destructive case, can be precluded from winning) by adding/deleting some candidates, and a combinatorial scenario where adding/deleting a candidate automatically means adding/deleting a whole group of candidates. Our results show that the parameterized complexity of candidate control (with the number of voters as the parameter) is much more varied than in the setting with many voters.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "AGH University of Science and Technology", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin"], "authors": ["Jiehua Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiehua", "Piotr Faliszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faliszewski:Piotr", "Rolf Niedermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niedermeier:Rolf", "Nimrod Talmon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talmon:Nimrod"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
