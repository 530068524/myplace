Manually annotating objects is quite expensive despite crowd engineering innovations. Current state-of-the-art automatic object detectors can accurately detect at most a few objects per image. This paper brings together the latest advancements in object detection and in crowd engineering into a principled framework for accurately and efficiently localizing objects in images. The input to the system is an image to annotate and a set of annotation constraints: desired precision, utility and/or human cost of the labeling. The output is a set of object annotations, informed by human feedback and computer vision. Our model seamlessly integrates multiple computer vision models with multiple sources of human input in a Markov Decision Process. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our human-in-the-loop labeling approach on the ILSVRC2014 object detection dataset.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Snapchat, USA"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Olga Russakovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Russakovsky:Olga", "Li-Jia Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Li=Jia", "Fei-Fei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Fei=Fei"], "pages": 11}
