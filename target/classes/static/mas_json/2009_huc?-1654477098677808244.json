{"title": "Understanding file access mechanisms for embedded Ubicomp collaboration interfaces.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "human computer interaction", "file system", "multimedia", "workspace"], "abstract": "This paper explores the nature of interfaces to support people in accessing their files at tabletop displays embedded in the environment. To do this, we designed a study comparing people's interaction with two very different classes of file system access interface: Focus, explicitly designed for tabletops, and the familiar hierarchical Windows Explorer. In our within-subjects double-crossover study, participants collaborated on 4 planning tasks. Based on video, logs, questionnaires and interviews, we conclude that both classes of interface have a place. Notably, Focus contributed to improved collaboration and more efficient use of the workspace than with Explorer. Our results inform a set of recommendations for future interfaces enabling this important class of interaction -- supporting access to files for collaboration at tabletop devices embedded in an ubicomp environment.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Sydney", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "University of Sydney", "National ICT Au ...
