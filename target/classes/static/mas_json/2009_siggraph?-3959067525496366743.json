Here, we report that vertically aligned nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes (VA-NCNTs) can act as a metal-free electrode with a much better electrocatalytic activity, long-term operation stability, and tolerance to crossover effect than platinum for oxygen reduction in alkaline fuel cells. In air-saturated 0.1 molar potassium hydroxide, we observed a steady-state output potential of \u201380 millivolts and a current density of 4.1 milliamps per square centimeter at \u20130.22 volts, compared with \u201385 millivolts and 1.1 milliamps per square centimeter at \u20130.20 volts for a platinum-carbon electrode. The incorporation of electron-accepting nitrogen atoms in the conjugated nanotube carbon plane appears to impart a relatively high positive charge density on adjacent carbon atoms. This effect, coupled with aligning the NCNTs, provides a four-electron pathway for the ORR on VA-NCNTs with a superb performance.", "citation": "Citations (4,440)", "departments": ["University of Dayton", "University of Dayton", "University of Akron", "Wright-Patterson Air Force Base", "University of Dayton", "University of Dayton Research Institute", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Canadian Light Source", "Canadian Light Source", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "General Motors", "General Motors", "General Motors", "General Motors", "Los Alamos National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Los Alamos National Laboratory", "Los Alamos National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Christopher Hendryx.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hendryx:Christopher"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
