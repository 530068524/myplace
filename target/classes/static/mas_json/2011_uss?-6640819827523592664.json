The garbled-circuit technique, a generic approach to secure two-party computation for semi-honest participants, was developed by Yao in the 1980s, but has been viewed as being of limited practical significance due to its inefficiency. We demonstrate several techniques for improving the running time and memory requirements of the garbled-circuit technique, resulting in an implementation of generic secure two-party computation that is significantly faster than any previously reported while also scaling to arbitrarily large circuits. We validate our approach by demonstrating secure computation of circuits with over 10 9 gates at a rate of roughly 10 ms per garbled gate, and showing order-of-magnitude improvements over the best previous privacy-preserving protocols for computing Hamming distance, Levenshtein distance, Smith-Waterman genome alignment, and AES.", "citation": "Citations (519)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Intel"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Yan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Yan", "David Evans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Evans_0001:David", "Jonathan Katz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katz:Jonathan", "Lior Malka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malka:Lior"], "pages": -1}
