They are supported in extended description logics that adapt classical description logics to deal with numerical probabilities or fuzzy truth degrees. While the two concepts are distinguished for good reasons, they combine in the notion of probably, which is ultimately a fuzzy qualification of probabilities. Here, we develop existing propositional logics of fuzzy probability into a full-blown description logic, and we show decidability of several variants of this logic under \u0141ukasiewicz semantics. We obtain these results in a novel generic framework of fuzzy coalgebraic logic; this enables us to extend our results to logics that combine crisp ingredients including standard crisp roles and crisp numerical probabilities with fuzzy roles and fuzzy probabilities.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "DFKI GmbH, Bremen"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Lutz Schr\u00f6der.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schr=ouml=der:Lutz", "Dirk Pattinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pattinson:Dirk"], "pages": 7}
