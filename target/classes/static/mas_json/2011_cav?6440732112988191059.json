{"title": "Synthesizing Cyber-Physical Architectural Models with Real-Time Constraints.", "fields": ["industrial design", "cyber physical system", "modulo", "specification language", "solver"], "abstract": "We present techniques that enable designers to algorithmically synthesize cyber-physical architectural models with real-time constraints. We do this by providing a meta-architectural specification language that allows designers to specify what properties their architectural models should have, not how to achieve them. This provides designers with a qualitatively new level of abstraction that enables the exploration of design spaces at the earliest stages of design, when doing so provides the most benefit. Our key technical contribution is the development of an Integer linear programming Modulo Theories (IMT) solver along with a scheduling theory solver. Our solver was used to automatically synthesize cyber-physical architectural models with hard real-time constraints from a large-scale industrial design.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Christine Hang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hang:Christine", "Panagiotis Manolios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manolios:Panagiotis", "Vasilis Papavasileiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papavasileiou:Vasilis"], "pages": 16}
