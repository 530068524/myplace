{"title": "How Bad is Suboptimal Rate Allocation?", "fields": ["throughput", "saturation", "network performance", "maximization", "maximum flow problem"], "abstract": "Not too bad. A rate allocation that is suboptimal with respect to a utility maximization formulation still maintains the maximum flow-level stability when the utility gap is sufficiently small, and provides a minimum size of stability region otherwise. Utility-suboptimal allocation may also enhance other network performance metrics, e.g., it may increase network throughput and reduce link saturation. Quantifying these intuitions, this paper provides a theoretical support for turning attention from optimal but complex solutions of network optimization to those that are simple even though suboptimal.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Purdue University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Tian Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Tian", "Xiaojun Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xiaojun", "Mung Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang:Mung", "Ruby B.
