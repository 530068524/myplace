For their proposed parameters, they found that their scheme was the \u201cmost efficient of those that support an additive homomorphic property\u201d. Unfortunately, it turns out that those parameters, originally aiming at 128-bit security, can be broken in a matter of seconds.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Institut Universitaire de France", "Seoul National University", "CryptoExperts", "NTT Secure Plat ... rm Laboratories"], "authors": ["Pierre-Alain Fouque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fouque:Pierre=Alain", "Moon Sung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Moon_Sung", "Tancr\u00e8de Lepoint.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepoint:Tancr=egrave=de", "Mehdi Tibouchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tibouchi:Mehdi"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
