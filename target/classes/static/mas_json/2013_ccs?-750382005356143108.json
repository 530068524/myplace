{"title": "An IDS framework for internet of things empowered by 6LoWPAN.", "fields": ["6lowpan", "denial of service attack", "personal area network", "smart objects", "ipv6"], "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm where smart objects are seamlessly connected to the overall Internet and can potentially cooperate to achieve common objectives such as supporting innovative home automation services. With reference to such a scenario, this paper presents an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework for IoT empowered by IPv6 over low-power personal area network (6LoWPAN) devices. In fact, 6LoWPAN is an interesting protocol supporting the realization of IoT in a resource constrained environment. 6LoWPAN devices are vulnerable to attacks inherited from both the wireless sensor networks and the Internet protocols. The proposed IDS framework which includes a monitoring system and a detection engine has been integrated into the network framework developed within the EU FP7 project `ebbits'. A penetration testing (PenTest) system had been used to evaluate the performance of the implemented IDS framework. Preliminary tests revealed that the proposed framework represents a promising solution for ensuring better security in 6LoWPANs.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Istituto Superiore Mario Boella", "Istituto Superiore Mario Boella", "Istituto Superiore Mario Boella", "Istituto Superiore Mario Boella", "Istituto Superiore Mario Boella"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Prabhakaran Kasinathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasinathan:Prabhakaran", "Gianfranco Costamagna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costamagna:Gianfranco", "Hussein Khaleel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khaleel:Hussein", "Claudio Pastrone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pastrone:Claudio", "Maurizio A.
