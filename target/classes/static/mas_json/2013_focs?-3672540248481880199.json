{"title": "Nearly Maximum Flows in Nearly Linear Time.", "fields": ["approximation algorithm", "conductance", "residual", "flow routing", "maximum flow problem"], "abstract": "We introduce a new approach to the maximum flow problem in undirected, capacitated graphs using congestion-approximators: easy-to-compute functions that approximate the congestion required to route single-commodity demands in a graph to within some factor \u03b1. Our algorithm maintains an arbitrary flow that may have some residual excess and deficits, while taking steps to minimize a potential function measuring the congestion of the current flow plus an over-estimate of the congestion required to route the residual demand. Since the residual term over-estimates, the descent process gradually moves the contribution to our potential function from the residual term to the congestion term, eventually achieving a flow routing the desired demands with nearly minimal congestion after O\u0303(\u03b1 2 e -2  log 2  n) iterations. Our approach is similar in spirit to that used by Spielman and Teng (STOC 2004) for solving Laplacian systems, and we summarize our approach as trying to do for l \u221e -flows what they do for l \u221e -flows. Together with a nearly linear time construction of a no(1)-congestion-approximator, we obtain 1 + e-optimal singlecommodity flows undirected graphs in time m 1+o (1)e -2 , yielding the fastest known algorithm for that problem. Our requirements of a congestion-approximator are quite low, suggesting even faster and simpler algorithms for certain classes of graphs. For example, an \u03b1-competitive oblivious routing tree meets our definition, even without knowing how to route the tree back in the graph. For graphs of conductance \u03c6, a trivial \u03c6 -1 -congestionapproximator gives an extremely simple algorithm for finding O\u0303(m\u03c6 -1 ).", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Jonah Sherman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sherman:Jonah"], "pages": 7}
