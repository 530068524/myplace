Collaboration is usually supported by optimistic versioning based on workspaces and a repository. Workspace copies of a model are synchronize with the repository version by an update function. Most update functions currently available compromise the consistency of a model. We present a new approach which guarantees updated models to be consistent and processable by standard visual editors without post-processing. Our approach assumes changes in the repository to be represented as a consistency-preserving edit script. This edit script is executed in a controlled, interactive manner on the workspace copy. Unlike 3-way merging, our approach needs no conflict analysis. Conflicts are detected and resolved interactively. Our approach offers improved usability and requires less implementation effort than existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen"], "authors": ["Timo Kehrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kehrer:Timo", "Udo Kelter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelter:Udo", "Dennis Reuling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reuling:Dennis"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
