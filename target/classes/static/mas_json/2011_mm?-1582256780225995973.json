{"title": "Eventscapes: visualizing events over time with emotive facets.", "fields": ["information needs", "formative assessment", "emotive", "mood", "online community"], "abstract": "The scale and dynamicity of social media, and interaction between traditional news sources and online communities, has created challenges to information retrieval approaches. Users may have no clear information need or be unable to express it in the appropriate idiom, requiring instead to be oriented in an unfamiliar domain, to explore and learn. We present a novel data-driven visualization, termed Eventscape, that combines time, visual media, mood, and controversy. Formative evaluation highlights the value of emotive facets for rapid evaluation of mixed news and social media topics, and a role for such visualizations as pre-cursors to deeper search.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Curtin University", "Curtin University", "Curtin University"], "authors": ["Brett Adams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adams:Brett", "Dinh Q.
