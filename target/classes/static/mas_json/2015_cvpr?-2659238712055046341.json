However, recognizing the grasp type from unconstrained scenes is challenging because of the large variations in appearance, occlusions and geometric distortions. In this paper, first we present a convolutional neural network to classify functional hand grasp types. Experiments on a public static scene hand data set validate good performance of the presented method. Then we present two applications utilizing grasp type classification: (a) inference of human action intention and (b) fine level manipulation action segmentation. Experiments on both tasks demonstrate the usefulness of grasp type as a cognitive feature for computer vision. This study shows that the grasp type is a powerful symbolic representation for action understanding, and thus opens new avenues for future research.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "NICTA", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yezhou Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yezhou", "Cornelia Ferm\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferm=uuml=ller:Cornelia", "Yi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yi", "Yiannis Aloimonos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aloimonos:Yiannis"], "pages": 9}
