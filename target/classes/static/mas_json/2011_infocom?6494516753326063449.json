{"title": "IP fast ReRoute: Loop Free Alternates revisited.", "fields": ["fast reroute", "multiprotocol label switching", "software deployment", "network topology", "approximation algorithm"], "abstract": "IP Fast ReRoute (IPFRR) is the IETF standard for providing fast failure protection in IP and MPLS/LDP networks and Loop Free Alternates (LFA) is a basic specification for implementing it. Even though LFA is simple and unobtrusive, it has a significant drawback: it does not guarantee protection for all possible failure cases. Consequently, many IPFRR proposals have appeared lately, promising full failure coverage at the price of added complexity and non-trivial modifications to IP hardware and software. Meanwhile, LFA remains the only commercially available, and therefore, the only deployable IPFRR solution. Deployment, however, crucially depends on the extent to which LFA can protect failures in operational networks. In this paper, therefore, we revisit LFA in order to give theoretical insights and practical hints to LFA failure coverage analysis. First, we identify the topological properties a network must possess to profit from good failure coverage. Then, we study how coverage varies as new links are added to a network, we show how to do this optimally and, through extensive simulations, we arrive to the conclusion that cleverly adding just a couple of new links can improve the quality of LFA protection drastically.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Ericsson", "Ericsson"], "authors": ["G\u00e1bor R\u00e9tv\u00e1ri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=eacute=tv=aacute=ri:G=aacute=bor", "J\u00e1nos Tapolcai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tapolcai:J=aacute=nos", "G\u00e1bor Enyedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Enyedi:G=aacute=bor", "Andr\u00e1s Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cs=aacute=sz=aacute=r:Andr=aacute=s"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
