{"title": "Capturing an Evader in a Polygonal Environment with Obstacles.", "fields": ["computer science", "finite set", "polygon", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "We study a pursuit-evasion game in which one or more cops try to capture a robber by moving onto the robber's current location. All players have equal maximum velocities. They can observe each other at all times. We show that three cops can capture the robber in any polygonal environment (which can contain any finite number of holes).", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Deepak Bhadauria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhadauria:Deepak", "Volkan Isler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isler:Volkan"], "pages": 6}
