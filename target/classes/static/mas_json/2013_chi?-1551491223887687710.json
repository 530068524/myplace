{"title": "The dynamics of younger and older adult's paired behavior when playing an interactive silhouette game.", "fields": ["multimedia", "silhouette", "computer science", "gesture"], "abstract": "In this paper, we report on the findings of an acute trial in which we evaluate the design of a novel gesture-based game. 60 younger and older players, divided into three separate group-types: (i) Young-Young, (ii) Old-Old, and (iii) Young-Old, took part in the study. The primary aim of this work was to evaluate the communicative and cooperative behavior of same-age and mixed-age pairs, with secondary interests in their perceived ease-of-use of the game. A mixed-method approach was used, comprising of direct observations, a post-game questionnaire and paired interviews. Our results identified noticeable differences between the group-types, with the Young-Old showing more physical cooperation, as compared to the same-age groups. The work elaborates on how the young and old differ in expectations and perceived interaction, and concludes with some recommendations for future research.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Temasek Polytechnic", "Temasek Polytechnic", "Temasek Polytechnic", "Institute for I ... pore, Singapore", "Institute for I ... pore, Singapore"], "authors": ["Mark D.
