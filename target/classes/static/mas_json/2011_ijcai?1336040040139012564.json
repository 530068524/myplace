{"title": "Multidimensional Mereotopology with Betweenness.", "fields": ["incidence geometry", "qualitative reasoning", "betweenness centrality", "relative dimension", "mereotopology"], "abstract": "Qualitative reasoning about commonsense space often involves entities of different dimensions. We present a weak axiomatization of multidimensional qualitative space based on 'relative dimension' and dimension-independent 'containment' which suffice to define basic dimension-dependent mereotopological relations. We show the relationships to other meoreotopologies and to incidence geometry. The extension with betweenness, a primitive of relative position, results in a first-order theory that qualitatively abstracts ordered incidence geometry.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Torsten Hahmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hahmann:Torsten", "Michael Gr\u00fcninger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=uuml=ninger:Michael"], "pages": 6}
