However, overly investing in a single design idea can lead to fixation and impede the collaborative process. Does sharing multiple designs improve collaboration? In a study, participants created advertisements individually and then met with a partner. In the  Share Multiple  condition, participants designed and shared three ads. In the  Share Best  condition, participants designed three ads and selected one to share. In the  Share One  condition, participants designed and shared one ad. Sharing multiple designs improved outcome, exploration, sharing, and group rapport. These participants integrated more of their partner's ideas into their own subsequent designs, explored a more divergent set of ideas, and provided more productive critiques of their partner's designs. Furthermore, their ads were rated more highly and garnered a higher click-through rate when hosted online.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Harvard University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Steven Dow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dow:Steven", "Julie Fortuna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fortuna:Julie", "Dan Schwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwartz:Dan", "Beth Altringer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altringer:Beth", "Daniel L.
