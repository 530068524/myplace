It can also appear while observing another user making a mistake. This paper investigates ERN in collaborative settings where observing another user (the executer) perform a task is typical and then explores its applicability to HCI. We first show that ERN can be detected on signals captured by commodity EEG headsets like an Emotiv headset when observing another person perform a typical multiple-choice reaction time task. We then investigate the anticipation effects by detecting ERN in the time interval when an executer is reaching towards an answer. We show that we can detect this signal with both a clinical EEG device and with an Emotiv headset. Our results show that online single trial detection is possible using both headsets during tasks that are typical of collaborative interactive applications. However there is a trade-off between the detection speed and the quality/prices of the headsets. Based on the results, we discuss and present several HCI scenarios for use of ERN in observing tasks and collaborative settings.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chi Thanh Vi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vi:Chi_Thanh", "Izdihar Jamil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jamil:Izdihar", "David Coyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coyle:David", "Sriram Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Sriram"], "pages": 10}
