{"title": "Network anti-spoofing with SDN data plane.", "fields": ["spoofing attack", "forwarding plane", "wire speed", "dynamic network analysis", "latency"], "abstract": "Traditional DDoS anti-spoofing scrubbers require dedicated middleboxes thus adding CAPEX, latency and complexity in the network. This paper starts by showing that the current SDN match-and-action model is rich enough to implement a collection of anti-spoofing methods. Secondly we develop and utilize advance methods for dynamic resource sharing to distribute the required mitigation resources over a network of switches. None of the earlier attempts to implement anti-spoofing in SDN actually directly exploited the match and action power of the switch data plane. They required additional functionalities on top of the match-and-action model, and are not implementable on an SDN switch as is. Our method builds on the premise that an SDN data path is a very fast and efficient engine to perform low level primitive operations at wire speed. The solution requires a number of flow-table rules and switch-controller messages proportional to the legitimate traffic. To scale when protecting multiple large servers the flow tables of multiple switches are harnessed in a distributed and dynamic network based solution. We have fully implemented all our methods in either Open-Flow1.5 in Open-vSwitch and in P4. The system mitigates spoofed attacks on either the SDN infrastructure itself or on downstream servers.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Yehuda Afek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Afek:Yehuda", "Anat Bremler-Barr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bremler=Barr:Anat", "Lior Shafir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shafir:Lior"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
