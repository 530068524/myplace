Using virtual queue techniques, we solve the two problems with variants of dynamic c\u03bc rules. These algorithms adaptively choose a strict priority policy, in response to past observed delays in all job classes, in every busy period. Our policies require limited or no statistics of the queue. Their optimal performance is proved by Lyapunov drift analysis and validated through simulations.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Chih-Ping Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chih=Ping", "Michael J.
