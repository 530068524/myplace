In this paper, we investigate the joint routing and link scheduling problem of multi-hop CR networks under uncertain spectrum supply. We model the vacancy of licensed bands with a series of random variables, and introduce corresponding scheduling constraints and flow routing constraints for such a network. From a CR network planner/operator's point of view, we characterize the network with a pair of (\u03b1; \u03b2) parameters, and present a mathematical formulation with the goal of minimizing the required network-wide spectrum resource at the (\u03b1; \u03b2) level. Given that (\u03b1; \u03b2) is specified, we derive a lower bound for the optimization problem and develop a threshold based coarse-grained fixing algorithm for a feasible solution. Simulation results show that i) for any (\u03b1; \u03b2) level, the proposed algorithm provides a near-optimal solution to the formulated NP-hard problem; ii) the (\u03b1; \u03b2) based solution is better than expected bandwidth based one in terms of blocking ratio as well as spectrum utilization in CR networks.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "Mississippi State University", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Miao Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Miao", "Chi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Chi", "Pan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Pan", "Yuguang Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Yuguang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
