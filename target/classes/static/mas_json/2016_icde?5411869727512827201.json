{"title": "Practical privacy-preserving user profile matching in social networks.", "fields": ["encryption", "user profile", "user modeling", "data breach", "privacy software"], "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a scenario where a user queries a user profile database, maintained by a social networking service provider, to find out some users whose profiles are similar to the profile specified by the querying user. A typical example of this application is online dating. Most recently, an online data site, Ashley Madison, was hacked, which results in disclosure of a large number of dating user profiles. This serious data breach has urged researchers to explore practical privacy protection for user profiles in online dating. In this paper, we give a privacy-preserving solution for user profile matching in social networks by using multiple servers. Our solution is built on homomorphic encryption and allows a user to find out some matching users with the help of the multiple servers without revealing to anyone privacy of the query and the queried user profiles. Our solution achieves user profile privacy and user query privacy as long as at least one of the multiple servers is honest. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that our solution is practical.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["RMIT University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "RMIT University"], "authors": ["Xun Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Xun", "Elisa Bertino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertino:Elisa", "Fang-Yu Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Fang=Yu", "Athman Bouguettaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouguettaya:Athman"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
