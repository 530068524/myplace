Several recently proposed DTN routing algorithms have utilized the DTNs' cyclic properties for predicting future forwarding. The prediction is based on metrics abstracted from nodes' contact history. However, the robustness of the encounter prediction becomes vital for DTN routing since malicious nodes can provide forged metrics or follow sophisticated mobility patterns to attract packets and gain a significant advantage in encounter prediction. In this paper, we examine the impact of the blackhole attack and its variations in DTN routing. We introduce the concept of encounter tickets to secure the evidence of each contact. In our scheme, nodes adopt a unique way of interpreting the contact history by making observations based on the collected encounter tickets. Then, following the Dempster-Shafer theory, nodes form trust and confidence opinions towards the competency of each encountered forwarding node. Extensive real-trace-driven simulation results are presented to support the effectiveness of our system.", "citation": "Citations (166)", "departments": ["Florida Atlantic University", "Florida Atlantic University", "Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Feng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Feng", "Jie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Jie", "Anand Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Anand"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
