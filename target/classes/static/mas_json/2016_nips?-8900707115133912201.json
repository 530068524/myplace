This field covers different settings like semi-supervised learning, learning with label proportions, multi-instance learning, noise-tolerant learning, etc. This paper presents a generic framework to deal with these weakly labeled scenarios. We introduce the beta-risk as a generalized formulation of the standard empirical risk based on surrogate margin-based loss functions. This risk allows us to express the reliability on the labels and to derive different kinds of learning algorithms. We specifically focus on SVMs and propose a soft margin beta-svm algorithm which behaves better that the state of the art.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Jean Monnet University", "Jean Monnet University"], "authors": ["Valentina Zantedeschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zantedeschi:Valentina", "R\u00e9mi Emonet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emonet:R=eacute=mi", "Marc Sebban.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebban:Marc"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
