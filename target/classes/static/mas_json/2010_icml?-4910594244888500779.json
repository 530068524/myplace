A learning problem is said to be ambiguously supervised when, for a given training input, a set of output candidates is provided with no prior of which one is correct. We propose to tackle this problem by solving a related unambiguous task with a label ranking approach and show how and why this performs well on the original task, via the method of task-transfer. We apply it to learning to match natural language sentences to a structured representation of their meaning and empirically demonstrate that this competes with the state-of-the-art on two benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "Google"], "authors": ["Antoine Bordes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bordes:Antoine", "Nicolas Usunier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Usunier:Nicolas", "Jason Weston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weston:Jason"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
