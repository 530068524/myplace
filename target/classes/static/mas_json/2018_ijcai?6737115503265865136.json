The objective is to maximize the number of agents that can reach their given goal vertices from their given start vertices within the deadline, without colliding with each other. We first show that MAPF-DL is NP-hard to solve optimally. We then present two classes of optimal algorithms, one based on a reduction of MAPF-DL to a flow problem and a subsequent compact integer linear programming formulation of the resulting reduced abstracted multi-commodity flow network and the other one based on novel combinatorial search algorithms. Our empirical results demonstrate that these MAPF-DL solvers scale well and each one dominates the other ones in different scenarios.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Tsinghua University", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Hang Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma_0001:Hang", "Glenn Wagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagner:Glenn", "Ariel Felner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felner:Ariel", "Jiaoyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiaoyang", "T.
