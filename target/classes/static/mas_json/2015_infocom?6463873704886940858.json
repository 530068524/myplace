{"title": "HySIM: A hybrid spectrum and information market for TV white space networks.", "fields": ["commission", "network effect", "white spaces", "information market", "licensee"], "abstract": "We propose a hybrid spectrum and information market for database-assisted TV white space networks, where a geo-location white space database serves as the platform for both the spectrum market and the information market. We study the interactions among the database operator, the spectrum licensee, and unlicensed users systematically, using a three-layer hierarchical model. In Layer I, the licensee negotiates with the database regarding the commission fee of using the spectrum market platform. In Layer II, the database and the licensee compete for selling information or channels to unlicensed users. In Layer III, unlicensed users determine whether to buy the exclusive usage right of licensed channels from the licensee, or to buy the information regarding unlicensed channels from the database. Analyzing such a three-layer model is challenging, due to the coexistence of both positive and negative network externalities in the information market. We characterize the market equilibrium systematically, and analyze how the network externalities affect the equilibrium behaviours of all parties involved. Our numerical results show that the proposed hybrid market can improve the network profit more than 80%, compared with a pure information market. Meanwhile, the achieved network profit is very close to the coordinated benchmark (e.g., the gap is less than 4%).", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Yuan Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Yuan", "Lin Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Lin", "Jianwei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jianwei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
