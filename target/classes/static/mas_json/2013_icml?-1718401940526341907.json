{"title": "Label Partitioning For Sublinear Ranking.", "fields": ["ranking", "annotation", "partition", "ranking svm", "sublinear function"], "abstract": "We consider the case of ranking a very large set of labels, items, or documents, which is common to information retrieval, recommendation, and large-scale annotation tasks. We present a general approach for converting an algorithm which has linear time in the size of the set to a sublinear one via label partitioning. Our method consists of learning an input partition and a label assignment to each partition of the space such that precision at k is optimized, which is the loss function of interest in this setting. Experiments on large-scale ranking and recommendation tasks show that our method not only makes the original linear time algorithm computationally tractable, but can also improve its performance.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Jason Weston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weston:Jason", "Ameesh Makadia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makadia:Ameesh", "Hector Yee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yee:Hector"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
