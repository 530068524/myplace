{"title": "In the mood: engaging teenagers in psychotherapy using mobile phones.", "fields": ["mental illness", "mobile phone", "mood", "psychological intervention", "mental health"], "abstract": "Mental illness is a significant and growing problem throughout the world. Many mental health problems have their root in childhood, and early intervention is recommended. Engaging young people in psychotherapeutic activities is challenging, and treatment adherence is often poor. This paper presents a series of studies carried out as part of the development of a mobile and online symptom tracking tool for adolescents with mental health problems. Teenagers use the system to record symptoms on their mobile phones and can view this information in a clinical setting with a therapist. We focus on a clinical pilot of the system with ten users in public mental health clinics. As well as indicating that the mobile diary tool can increase client adherence to therapeutic activities, the study yields insight into the factors influencing the success of the design and informs the design of other systems to be used as adjuncts to therapy.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Trinity College", "Trinity College"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mark Matthews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthews:Mark", "Gavin J.
