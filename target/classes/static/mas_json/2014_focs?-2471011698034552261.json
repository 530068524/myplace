This answers the long-standing open problem of whether there are families of k-CNF formulas of polynomial size which require quadratic total space in resolution. The results follow from a more general theorem showing that, for formulas satisfying certain conditions, in every resolution refutation there is a memory configuration containing many clauses of large width.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Inst. of Math., ...
