{"title": "ERUCA: Efficient DRAM Resource Utilization and Resource Conflict Avoidance for Memory System Parallelism.", "fields": ["system bus", "conflict avoidance", "eruca", "exploit", "speedup"], "abstract": "Memory system performance is measured by access latency and bandwidth, and DRAM access parallelism critically impacts for both. To improve DRAM parallelism, previous research focused on increasing the number of effective banks by sub-dividing one physical bank. We find that without avoiding conflicts on the shared resources among (sub)banks, the benefits are limited. We propose mechanisms for efficient DRAM resource utilization and resource-conflict avoidance (ERUCA). ERUCA reduces conflicts on shared (sub)bank resources utilizing row address locality between sub-banks and improving the DRAM chip-level data bus. Area overhead for ERUCA is kept near zero with a unique implementation that exploits under-utilized resources available in commercial DRAM chips. Overall ERUCA provides 15% speedup while incurring <0.3% DRAM die area overhead.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Sangkug Lym.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lym:Sangkug", "Heonjae Ha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ha:Heonjae", "Yongkee Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Yongkee", "Chun-Kai Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Chun=Kai", "Jungrae Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jungrae", "Mattan Erez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erez:Mattan"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2018", "pages": 13}
