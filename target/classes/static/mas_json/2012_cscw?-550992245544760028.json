{"title": "To stay or leave?: the relationship of emotional and informational support to commitment in online health support groups.", "fields": ["information needs", "support group", "social support", "online community", "online health communities"], "abstract": "Today many people with serious diseases use online support groups to seek social support. For these groups to be sustained and effective, member retention and commitment is important. Our study examined how different types and amounts of social support in an online cancer support group are associated with participants' length of membership. We first built machine learning models to automatically identify the extent to which messages contained emotional and informational support. Agreement with human judges was high ( r  > 0.76). We then used these models to measure the support exchanged in 1.5 million messages. Finally, we applied quantitative event history analysis to assess how exposure to emotional and informational support predicted group members' length of subsequent participation. The results demonstrated that the more emotional support members were exposed to, the lower the risk of dropout. In contrast, informational support did not have the same strong effects on commitment. We speculate that emotional support enhanced members' relationships with one another or the group as a whole, whereas informational support satisfied members' short-term information needs.", "citation": "Citations (162)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["Yi-Chia Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yi=Chia", "Robert E.
