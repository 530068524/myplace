{"title": "Temporal Property Verification as a Program Analysis Task.", "fields": ["program analysis", "recursion", "microsoft windows", "database server", "web server", "operator", "backtracking"], "abstract": "We describe a reduction from temporal property verification to a program analysis problem. We produce an encoding which, with the use of recursion and nondeterminism, enables off-the-shelf program analysis tools to naturally perform the reasoning necessary for proving temporal properties (e.g. backtracking, eventuality checking, tree counterexamples for branching-time properties, abstraction refinement, etc.). Using examples drawn from the PostgreSQL database server, Apache web server, and Windows OS kernel, we demonstrate the practical viability of our work.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "University of Cambridge", "Rice University", "University College London", "New York University", "Rice University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Byron Cook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cook:Byron", "Eric Koskinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koskinen:Eric", "Moshe Y.
