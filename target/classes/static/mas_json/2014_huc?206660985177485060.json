{"title": "Smart-mat: recognizing and counting gym exercises with low-cost resistive pressure sensing matrix.", "fields": ["activity recognition", "simulation", "resistive touchscreen", "pressure sensor", "matrix"], "abstract": "There is a large class of routine physical exercises that are performed on the ground, often on dedicated \"mats\" (e.g. push-ups, crunches, bridge). Such exercises involve coordinated motions of different body parts and are difficult to recognize with a single body worn motion sensors (like a step counter). Instead a network of sensors on different body parts would be needed, which is not always practicable. As an alternative we describe a cheap, simple textile pressure sensor matrix, that can be unobtrusively integrated into exercise mats to recognize and count such exercises. We evaluate the system on a set of 10 standard exercises. In an experiment with 7 subjects, each repeating each exercise 20 times, we achieve a user independent recognition rate of 82.5% and a user independent counting accuracy of 89.9%. The paper describes the sensor system, the recognition methods and the experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology"], "authors": ["Mathias Sundholm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundholm:Mathias", "Jingyuan Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Jingyuan", "Bo Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0005:Bo", "Akash Sethi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sethi:Akash", "Paul Lukowicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lukowicz:Paul"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
