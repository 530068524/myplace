Conventional memory controllers deliver relativelylow performance in part because they often employ fixed,rigid access scheduling policies designed for average-case applicationbehavior. As a result, they cannot learn and optimizethe long-term performance impact of their scheduling decisions,and cannot adapt their scheduling policies to dynamic workloadbehavior.We propose a new, self-optimizing memory controller designthat operates using the principles of reinforcement learning (RL)to overcome these limitations. Our RL-based memory controllerobserves the system state and estimates the long-term performanceimpact of each action it can take. In this way, the controllerlearns to optimize its scheduling policy on the fly to maximizelong-term performance. Our results show that an RL-basedmemory controller improves the performance of a set of parallelapplications run on a 4-core CMP by 19% on average (upto 33%), and it improves DRAM bandwidth utilization by 22%compared to a state-of-the-art controller.", "citation": "Citations (362)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Engin Ipek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ipek:Engin", "Onur Mutlu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mutlu:Onur", "Jos\u00e9 F.
