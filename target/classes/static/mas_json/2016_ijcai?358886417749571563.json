{"title": "Sherlock: Sparse Hierarchical Embeddings for Visually-Aware One-Class Collaborative Filtering.", "fields": ["product", "visual appearance", "curse of dimensionality", "collaborative filtering", "colorfulness"], "abstract": "Building successful recommender systems requires uncovering the underlying dimensions that describe the properties of items as well as users' preferences toward them. In domains like clothing recommendation, explaining users' preferences requires modeling the visual appearance of the items in question. This makes recommendation especially challenging, due to both the complexity and subtlety of people's 'visual preferences,' as well as the scale and dimensionality of the data and features involved. Ultimately, a successful model should be capable of capturing considerable variance across different categories and styles, while still modeling the commonalities explained by 'global' structures in order to combat the sparsity (e.g. cold-start), variability, and scale of real-world datasets. Here, we address these challenges by building such structures to model the visual dimensions across different product categories. With a novel hierarchical embedding architecture, our method accounts for both high-level (colorfulness, darkness, etc.) and subtle (e.g. casualness) visual characteristics simultaneously.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Ruining He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Ruining", "Chunbin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chunbin", "Jianguo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Jianguo", "Julian McAuley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McAuley:Julian"], "pages": 7}
