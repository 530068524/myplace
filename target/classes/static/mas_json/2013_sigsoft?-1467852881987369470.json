{"title": "h-ubu: an industrial-strength service-oriented component framework for JavaScript applications.", "fields": ["service orientation", "unobtrusive javascript", "rich internet application", "web engineering", "ajax"], "abstract": "In the last years, we developed web applications requiring a large amount of JavaScript code. These web applications present adaptation requirements. In addition to platform-centric adaptation, applications have to dynamically react to external events like connectivity disruptions. Building such applications is complex and we faced sharp maintainability challenges. This paper presents h-ubu, a service-oriented component framework for JavaScript allowing building adaptive applications. h-ubu is used in industrial web applications and mobile applications. h-ubu is available in open source, as part of the OW2 Nanoko project.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Grenoble", "University of Grenoble", "Ubidreams, France"], "authors": ["Cl\u00e9ment Escoffier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Escoffier:Cl=eacute=ment", "Philippe Lalanda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lalanda:Philippe", "Nicolas Rempulsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rempulsky:Nicolas"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
