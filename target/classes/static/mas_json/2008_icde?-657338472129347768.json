We demonstrate P2PMonitor, a P2P system for monitoring such systems. Alerters deployed on the monitored peers are designed to detect particular kinds of local events. They generate streams of XML data that form the primary sources of information for P2PMonitor. The core of the system is composed of processing components implementing the operators of an algebra over data streams. From a user viewpoint, monitoring a P2P system can be as simple as querying an XML document. The document is an ActiveXML document that aggregates a (possibly very large) number of streams generated by alerters on the monitored peers. Behind the scene, P2PMonitor compiles the monitoring query into a distributed monitoring plan, deploys alerters and stream algebra processors and issues notifications that are sent to users. The system functionalities are demonstrated by simulating the supply chain of a large company.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Serge Abiteboul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abiteboul:Serge", "Bogdan Marinoiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinoiu:Bogdan", "Pierre Bourhis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bourhis:Pierre"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
