UCam reflects hand's movement and directly maps it to the movement of 3D object based on visual tracking of feature-like points on incoming frames. Only one button is needed to differentiate rotation and translation. The advantages of this technique lie in the popularity and low cost of handheld cameras, low requirement and no need of adjustment of background and easy to use for beginners. To evaluate UCam, it is compared with mouse in some 3D controlling tasks. The results show that UCam is more flexible and easier to use and master in most cases. Even for complicated tasks, UCam has comparable performance as mouse.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Liang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Liang", "Yuanchun Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Yuanchun", "Mingming Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan_0001:Mingming"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
