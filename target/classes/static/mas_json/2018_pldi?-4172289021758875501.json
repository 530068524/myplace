{"title": "Bounding data races in space and time.", "fields": ["bounding overwatch", "spacetime", "x86", "operational semantics", "axiom"], "abstract": "We propose a new semantics for shared-memory parallel programs that gives strong guarantees even in the presence of data races. Our  local data race freedom  property guarantees that all data-race-free portions of programs exhibit sequential semantics. We provide a straightforward operational semantics and an equivalent axiomatic model, and evaluate an implementation for the OCaml programming language. Our evaluation demonstrates that it is possible to balance a comprehensible memory model with a reasonable (no overhead on x86, ~0.6% on ARM) sequential performance trade-off in a mainstream programming language.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Stephen Dolan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dolan:Stephen", "K.
