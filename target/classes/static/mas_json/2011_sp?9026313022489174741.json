Kartograph is passive and cannot be detected remotely. Motivated by these passive attacks, we present secure protocols for distributing game state among players so that each client only has data it is allowed to see. Our system, Open Conflict, runs real-time games with distributed state. To support our claim that Open Conflict is sufficiently fast for real-time strategy games, we show the results of an extensive study of 1000 replays of Star craft II games between expert players. At the peak of a typical game, Open Conflict needs only 22 milliseconds on one CPU core each time state is synchronized.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Elie Bursztein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bursztein:Elie", "Mike Hamburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamburg:Mike", "Jocelyn Lagarenne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lagarenne:Jocelyn", "Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2011", "pages": 15}
