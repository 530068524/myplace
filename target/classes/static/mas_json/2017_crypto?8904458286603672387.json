{"title": "Identity-Based Encryption from the Diffie-Hellman Assumption.", "fields": ["deterministic encryption", "multiple encryption", "plaintext aware encryption", "diffie hellman key exchange", "attribute based encryption", "watermarking attack"], "abstract": "We provide the first constructions of identity-based encryption and hierarchical identity-based encryption based on the hardness of the (Computational) Diffie-Hellman Problem (without use of groups with pairings) or Factoring. Our construction achieves the standard notion of identity-based encryption as considered by Boneh and Franklin [CRYPTO 2001]. We bypass known impossibility results using garbled circuits that make a non-black-box use of the underlying cryptographic primitives.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Nico D\u00f6ttling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=ouml=ttling:Nico", "Sanjam Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Sanjam"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 33}
