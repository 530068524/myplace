Like Lasso, it can efficiently learn a solution path based on a set of predefined parameters and therefore provides strong support for model selection. Sparse SVM has been successfully applied in a variety of data mining applications including text mining, bioinformatics, and image processing. The emergence of big-data analysis poses new challenges for model selection with large-scale data that consist of tens of millions samples and features. In this paper, a novel screening technique is proposed to accelerate model selection for l 1 -regularized l 2 -SVM and effectively improve its scalability. This technique can precisely identify inactive features in the optimal solution of a l 1 -regularized l 2 -SVM model and remove them before training. The technique makes use of the variational inequality and provides a closed-form solution for screening inactive features in different situations. Every feature that is removed by the screening technique is guaranteed to be inactive in the optimal solution. Therefore, when l 1 -regularized l 2 -SVM uses the features selected by the technique, it achieves exactly the same result as when it uses the full feature set. Because the technique can remove a large number of inactive features, it can greatly increase the efficiency of model selection for l 1 -regularized l 2 -SVM. Experimental results on five high-dimensional benchmark data sets demonstrate the power of the proposed technique.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["SAS Institute", "SAS Institute", "SAS Institute"], "authors": ["Zheng Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zheng", "Jun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Jun", "James Cox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cox:James"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
