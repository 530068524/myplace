Existing XKS engines primarily suffer from two limitations. First, although the smallest lowest common ancestor (SLCA) algorithm (or a variant, e.g., ELCA) is widely accepted as a meaningful way to identify subtrees containing the query keywords, SLCA typically performs poorly on documents with missing elements, i.e., (sub)elements that are optional, or appear in some instances of an element type but not all. Second, since keyword search can be ambiguous with multiple possible interpretations, it is desirable for an XKS engine to automatically expand the original query by providing a classification of different possible interpretations of the query w.r.t. the original results. However, existing XKS systems do not support such result-based query expansion. We demonstrate ASTERIX, an innovative XKS engine that addresses these limitations.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Utah State University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Ba Quan Truong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Truong:Ba_Quan", "Sourav S.
