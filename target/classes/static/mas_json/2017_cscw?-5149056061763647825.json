However, gamification approaches often cause competition between users, which might be inappropriate for working environments that seek cooperation. Drawing on the social interdependence theory, this paper provides a classification for gamification features and insights about the design of cooperative gamification. Using the example of an innova-tion community of a German engineering company, we present the design of a cooperative gamification approach and results from a first experimental evaluation. The findings indicate that the developed gamification approach has positive effects on perceived enjoyment and the intention towards knowledge sharing in the considered innovation community. Besides our conceptual contribu-tion, our findings suggest that cooperative gamification may be beneficial for cooperative working environments and represents a promising field for future research.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "University of Mannheim"], "authors": ["Benedikt Morschheuser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morschheuser:Benedikt", "Alexander Maedche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maedche:Alexander", "Dominic Walter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walter:Dominic"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
