This is an instance of a broad family of problems including machine translation, decipherment, and sentiment modification. The key challenge is to separate the content from other aspects such as style. We assume a shared latent content distribution across different text corpora, and propose a method that leverages refined alignment of latent representations to perform style transfer. The transferred sentences from one style should match example sentences from the other style as a population. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this cross-alignment method on three tasks: sentiment modification, decipherment of word substitution ciphers, and recovery of word order.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tianxiao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Tianxiao", "Tao Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Tao", "Regina Barzilay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barzilay:Regina", "Tommi S.
