EuroWordNet is a multilingual, WordNet-like database with basic semantic relations between words for several European languages (English, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, German, French, Czech, and Estonian). In addition to the relations in WordNet 1.5, EWN includes domain labels, cross-language, and cross-part-of-speech relations, which are directly useful for multilingual information retrieval. In our approach, documents in any language covered by EuroWordNet are indexed in a space of language-independent concepts (the EuroWordNet Inter Lingual Index), thus turning term weighting and query/document matching into language-independent tasks. We report on the results of a number of experiments that measure the potential benefits of the approach and its tolerance to word sense disambiguation errors. In our monolingual experiments, the classical, vector space model for text retrieval is shown to giv...", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Islamic Azad University", "Islamic Azad University", "University of Tehran", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "Keio University", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Islamic Azad University", "Islamic Azad University", "University of Tehran", "Keio Research Institute"], "authors": ["Ariel Raviv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raviv:Ariel", "Shaul Markovitch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markovitch:Shaul"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
