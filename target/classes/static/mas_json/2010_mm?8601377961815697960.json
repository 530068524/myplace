In most cases, the semantic component is intra-category stable and therefore can be used to construct an efficient 3D object retrieval scheme. By segmenting an object into segments and learning the similar segments shared by all the objects in the same category, we can summarise what human uses for object recognition, from the analysis of which we develop a method to find the semantic component of an object. In our experiments, the proposed method is justified and the effectiveness of our algorithm is also demonstrated.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Chunjing Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Chunjing", "Zhengwu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhengwu", "Jianzhuang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jianzhuang", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
