{"title": "Simulated Annealing Based Influence Maximization in Social Networks.", "fields": ["greedy randomized adaptive search procedure", "adaptive simulated annealing", "maximization", "maximum coverage problem", "speedup"], "abstract": "The problem of influence maximization, i.e., mining top-k influential nodes from a social network such that the spread of influence in the network is maximized, is NP-hard. Most of the existing algorithms for the problem are based on greedy algorithm. Although greedy algorithm can achieve a good approximation, it is computational expensive. In this paper, we propose a totally different approach based on Simulated Annealing(SA) for the influence maximization problem. This is the first SA based algorithm for the problem. Additionally, we propose two heuristic methods to accelerate the convergence process of SA, and a new method of computing influence to speed up the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on four real networks show that the proposed algorithms run faster than the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm by 2-3 orders of magnitude while being able to improve the accuracy of greedy algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (118)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Qingye Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Qingye", "Guojie Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Guojie", "Gao Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Gao", "Yu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yu", "Wenjun Si.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Si:Wenjun", "Kunqing Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Kunqing"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
