In this paper, we consider the problem of learning shared structures from multiple related tasks. We present an improved formulation ( i ASO) for multi-task learning based on the non-convex alternating structure optimization (ASO) algorithm, in which all tasks are related by a shared feature representation. We convert  i ASO, a non-convex formulation, into a relaxed convex one, which is, however, not scalable to large data sets due to its complex constraints. We propose an alternating optimization ( c ASO) algorithm which solves the convex relaxation efficiently, and further show that  c ASO converges to a global optimum. In addition, we present a theoretical condition, under which  c ASO can find a globally optimal solution to  i ASO. Experiments on several benchmark data sets confirm our theoretical analysis.", "citation": "Citations (120)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Jianhui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jianhui", "Lei Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Lei", "Jun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Jun", "Jieping Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jieping"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
