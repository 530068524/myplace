In this paper, we consider a new zero-shot learning task of extracting entities specified by a natural language query (in place of seeds) given only a single web page. Our approach defines a log-linear model over latent extraction predicates, which select lists of entities from the web page. The main challenge is to define features on widely varying candidate entity lists.
