{"title": "From scenario modeling to scenario programming for reactive systems with dynamic topology.", "fields": ["java", "theoretical computer science", "communications system", "modeling language", "reactive system"], "abstract": "Software-intensive systems often consist of cooperating reactive components. In mobile and reconfigurable systems, their topology changes at run-time, which influences how the components must cooperate. The Scenario Modeling Language (SML) offers a formal approach for specifying the reactive behavior such systems that aligns with how humans conceive and communicate behavioral requirements. Simulation and formal checks can find specification flaws early. We present a framework for the Scenario-based Programming (SBP) that reflects the concepts of SML in Java and makes the scenario modeling approach available for programming. SBP code can also be generated from SML and extended with platform-specific code, thus streamlining the transition from design to implementation. As an example serves a car-to-x communication system.
