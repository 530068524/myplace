{"title": "EventCube: multi-dimensional search and mining of structured and text data.", "fields": ["data set", "text mining", "online analytical processing", "data model", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "A large portion of real world data is either text or structured (e.g., relational) data. Moreover, such data objects are often linked together (e.g., structured specification of products linking with the corresponding product descriptions and customer comments). Even for text data such as news data, typed entities can be extracted with entity extraction tools. The EventCube project constructs TextCube and TopicCube from interconnected structured and text data (or from text data via entity extraction and dimension building), and performs multidimensional search and analysis on such datasets, in an informative, powerful, and user-friendly manner. This proposed EventCube demo will show the power of the system not only on the originally designed ASRS (Aviation Safety Report System) data sets, but also on news datasets collected from multiple news agencies, and academic datasets constructed from the DBLP and web data. The system has high potential to be extended in many powerful ways and serve as a general platform for search, OLAP (online analytical processing) and data mining on integrated text and structured data. After the system demo in the conference, the system will be put on the web for public access and evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Fangbo Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Fangbo", "Kin Hou Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Kin_Hou", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei", "Chengxiang Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Chengxiang", "Xiao Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiao", "Marina Danilevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danilevsky:Marina", "Nihit Desai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desai:Nihit", "Bolin Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Bolin", "Jing Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Jing", "Heng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Heng", "Rucha Kanade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanade:Rucha", "Anne Kao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kao:Anne", "Qi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0014:Qi", "Yanen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yanen", "Cindy Xide Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Cindy_Xide", "Jialu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jialu", "Nikunj C.
