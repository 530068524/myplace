{"title": "Direct product theorems for classical communication complexity via subdistribution bounds: extended abstract.", "fields": ["direct product", "communication complexity", "worst case complexity", "product distribution", "rectangle"], "abstract": "A basic question in complexity theory is whether the computational resources required for solving k independent instances of the same problem scale as k times the resources required for one instance. We investigate this question in various models of classical communication complexity. We introduce a new measure, the  subdistribution bound  , which is a relaxation of the well-studied rectangle or corruption bound in communication complexity. We nonetheless show that for the communication complexity of Boolean functions with constant error, the subdistribution bound is the same as the latter measure, up to a constant factor. We prove that the one-way version of this bound tightly captures the one-way public-coin randomized communication complexity of any relation, and the two-way version bounds the two-way public-coin randomized communication complexity from below. More importantly, we show that the bound satisfies the strong direct product property under product distributions for both one- and two-way protocols, and the weak direct product property under arbitrary distributions for two-way protocols. These results subsume and strengthen, in a unified manner, several recent results on the direct product question. The simplicity and broad applicability of our technique is perhaps an indication of its potential to solve yet more challenging questions regarding the direct product problem.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Goethe University Frankfurt", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Rahul Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0001:Rahul", "Hartmut Klauck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klauck:Hartmut", "Ashwin Nayak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nayak:Ashwin"], "pages": 10}
