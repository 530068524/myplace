While conventional photo display systems aim at improving the styles of presentation, we explore the visual and semantic feelings to create a space exhibiting the feelings from photographers. This is achieved by simulating the interactions among photos to emerge some flocking behaviors, where each photo is regarded as a simulated agent. To present the feelings of photos on the flocking, we construct two graphs by investigating the visual contents and tag semantics respectively. In addition, to enhance the diverse feelings of a photo collection, three audiovisual effects are composed to have rich presentation of feelings. Experimental results show that our PhotoFeel truly exhibits potential feelings for given photos and people comparatively favor our system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Cheng-Te Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Cheng=Te", "Hsun-Ping Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Hsun=Ping", "Shou-De Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Shou=De"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
