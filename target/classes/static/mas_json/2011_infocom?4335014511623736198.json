The scaling behavior of the energy consumption under the latency constraint is analyzed for random networks, where the nodes are uniformly placed in growing regions and the number of nodes goes to infinity. The special case of sum function computation and its delivery to a designated root node is considered first. A policy which achieves order-optimal average energy consumption in random networks subject to the given latency constraint is proposed. The scaling behavior of the optimal energy consumption depends on the path-loss exponent of wireless transmissions and the dimension of the Euclidean region where the nodes are placed. The policy is then extended to computation of a general class of functions which decompose according to maximal cliques of a proximity graph such as the k-nearest neighbor graph or the geometric random graph. The modified policy achieves order-optimal energy consumption albeit for a limited range of latency constraints.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Memphis", "University of Memphis", "University of California, Irvine", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Paul Balister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balister:Paul", "B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bollob=aacute=s:B=eacute=la", "Animashree Anandkumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anandkumar:Animashree", "Alan S.
