{"title": "Improved Average-Case Lower Bounds for DeMorgan Formula Size.", "fields": ["extractor", "boolean algebra", "combinatorics", "implicit function", "boolean function", "computational complexity theory", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics"], "abstract": "We give an explicit function h: {0, 1} n  \u2192 {0, 1} such that every deMorgan formula of size n 3-o(1) /r 2  agrees with h on at most a fraction of 1/2+2 -\u03a9(r)  of the inputs. This improves the previous average-case lower bound of Komargodski and Raz (STOC, 2013). Our technical contributions include a theorem that shows that the \"expected shrinkage\" result of Haastad (SIAM J. Comput., 1998) actually holds with very high probability (where the restrictions are chosen from a certain distribution that takes into account the structure of the formula), combining ideas of both Impagliazzo, Meka and Zuckerman (FOCS, 2012) and Komargodski and Raz. In addition, using a bit-fixing extractor in the construction of h allows us to simplify a major part of the analysis of Komargodski and Raz 1 .", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Ilan Komargodski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komargodski:Ilan", "Ran Raz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raz:Ran", "Avishay Tal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tal:Avishay"], "pages": 10}
