{"title": "Hardness of Online Sleeping Combinatorial Optimization Problems.", "fields": ["permutation", "open problem", "minimum spanning tree", "expression", "minimum cut"], "abstract": "We show that several online combinatorial optimization problems that admit efficient no-regret algorithms become computationally hard in the sleeping setting where a subset of actions becomes unavailable in each round. Specifically, we show that the sleeping versions of these problems are at least as hard as PAC learning DNF expressions, a long standing open problem. We show hardness for the sleeping versions of Online Shortest Paths, Online Minimum Spanning Tree, Online k-Subsets, Online k-Truncated Permutations, Online Minimum Cut, and Online Bipartite Matching. The hardness result for the sleeping version of the Online Shortest Paths problem resolves an open problem presented at COLT 2015 [Koolen et al., 2015].", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "University of Michigan", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Satyen Kale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kale:Satyen", "Chansoo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chansoo", "D\u00e1vid P\u00e1l.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=aacute=l:D=aacute=vid"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
