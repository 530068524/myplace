Will new users become committed members? What types of roles are particular individuals most likely to take on? We report on a study that investigates these questions. We administered a survey (based on standard psychological instruments) to nearly 4000 new users of the MovieLens film recommendation community from October 2009 to March 2010 and logged their usage history on MovieLens. We found that general volunteer motivations, pro-social behavioral history, and community-specific motivations predicted both the amount of use and specific types of activities users engaged in after joining the community. These findings have implications for the design and management of online communities.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Paul Fugelstad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fugelstad:Paul", "Patrick Dwyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dwyer:Patrick", "Jennifer Filson Moses.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moses:Jennifer_Filson", "John Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:John", "Cleila Anna Mannino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannino:Cleila_Anna", "Loren G.
