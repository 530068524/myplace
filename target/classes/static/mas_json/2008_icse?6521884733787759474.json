{"title": "Tracking source locations.", "fields": ["software development", "source code", "computer engineering", "intentional programming", "software evolution"], "abstract": "Many programming tools require information to be associated with source locations. Current tools do this in different ways with different degrees of effectiveness. This paper is an investigation into the various approaches to maintaining source locations. It is based on an experiment that attempts to track a variety of locations over the evolution of a source file. The results demonstrate that relatively simple techniques can be very effective.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Brown University"], "authors": ["Steven P.
