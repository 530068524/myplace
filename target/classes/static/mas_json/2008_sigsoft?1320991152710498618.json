{"title": "Marple: a demand-driven path-sensitive buffer overflow detector.", "fields": ["source lines of code", "buffer overflow", "fault detection and isolation", "scalability", "software security assurance"], "abstract": "Despite increasing efforts in detecting and managing software security vulnerabilities, the number of security attacks is still rising every year. As software becomes more complex, security vulnerabilities are more easily introduced into a system and more difficult to eliminate. Even though buffer overflow detection has been studied for more than 20 years, it is still the most commonly exploited vulnerability. In this paper, we develop a static analyzer for detecting and helping diagnose buffer overflows with the key idea of categorizing program paths as they relate to vulnerability. We combine path-sensitivity with a demand-driven analysis for precision and scalability. We first develop a vulnerability model for buffer overflow and then use the model in the development of the demand-driven path-sensitive analyzer. We detect and identify categories of paths including  infeasible, safe, vulnerable, overflow-input-independent  and  don't-know . The categorization enables priorities to be set when searching for root causes of vulnerable paths. We implemented our analyzer, Marple, and compared its performance with existing tools. Our experiments show that Marple is able to detect buffer overflows that other tools cannot, and being path-sensitive with prioritization, Marple produces only 1 false positive out of 72 reported overflows. We also show that Marple scales to 570,000 lines of code, the largest benchmark we had.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Wei Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Wei", "Mary Lou Soffa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soffa:Mary_Lou"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2008", "pages": 11}
