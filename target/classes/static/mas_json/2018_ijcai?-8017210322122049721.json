{"title": "Algorithms for Fair Load Shedding in Developing Countries.", "fields": ["grid", "mains electricity", "load shedding", "pairwise comparison", "heuristics"], "abstract": "Due to the limited generation capacity of power stations, many developing countries frequently resort to disconnecting large parts of the power grid from supply, a process termed load shedding. During load shedding, many homes are left without electricity, causing them inconvenience and discomfort. In this paper, we present a number of optimization heuristics that focus on pairwise and groupwise fairness, such that households (i.e. agents) are fairly allocated electricity. We evaluate the heuristics against standard fairness metrics in terms of comfort delivered to homes, as well as the number of times they are disconnected from electricity supply. Thus, we establish new benchmarks for fair load shedding schemes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Olabambo I.
