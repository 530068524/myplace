{"title": "Column-Oriented Datalog Materialization for Large Knowledge Graphs.", "fields": ["datalog", "machine learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "graph"], "abstract": "The evaluation of Datalog rules over large Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is essential for many applications. In this paper, we present a new method of materializing Datalog inferences, which combines a column-based memory layout with novel optimization methods that avoid redundant inferences at runtime. The pro-active caching of certain subqueries further increases efficiency. Our empirical evaluation shows that this approach can often match or even surpass the performance of state-of-the-art systems, especially under restricted resources.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["VU University Amsterdam", "VU University Amsterdam", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Jacopo Urbani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urbani:Jacopo", "Ceriel J.
