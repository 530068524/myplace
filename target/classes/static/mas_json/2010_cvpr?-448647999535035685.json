Due to the fact that searching for a particular event of interest within hours of video is time consuming, most captured videos are never examined, and are only used in a post-factum manner. In this work, we introduce activity-specific video summaries, which provide an effective means of browsing and indexing video based on a set of events of interest. Our method automatically generates a compact video representation of a long sequence, which features only activities of interest while preserving the general dynamics of the original video. Given a long input video sequence, we compute optical flow and represent the corresponding vector field in the Clifford Fourier domain. Dynamic regions within the flow field are identified within the phase spectrum volume of the flow field. We then compute the likelihood that certain activities of relevance occur within the the video by correlating it with spatio-temporal maximum average correlation height filters. Finally, the input sequence is condensed via a temporal shift optimization, resulting in a short video clip which simultaneously displays multiple instances of each relevant activity.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Central Florida"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mikel D.
