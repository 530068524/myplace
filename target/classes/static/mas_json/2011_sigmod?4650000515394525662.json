{"title": "A cross-service travel engine for trip planning.", "fields": ["public transport", "visualization", "data integrity", "data integration", "semantic integration"], "abstract": "The online travel services and resources are far from well organized and integrated. Trip planning is still a laborious job requiring interaction with a combination of services such as travel guides, personal travel blogs, map services and public transportation to piece together an itinerary. To facilitate this process, we have designed a cross-service travel engine for trip planners. Our system seamlessly and semantically integrates various types of travel services and resources based on a geographical ontology. We also built a user-friendly visualization tool for travellers to conveniently browse and design personal itineraries on Google Maps.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Gang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Gang", "Chen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chen", "Meiyu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Meiyu", "Beng Chin Ooi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ooi:Beng_Chin", "Shanshan Ying.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ying:Shanshan", "Anthony K.
