We present a novel recurrent neural network model that is capable of extracting information from an image or video by adaptively selecting a sequence of regions or locations and only processing the selected regions at high resolution. Like convolutional neural networks, the proposed model has a degree of translation invariance built-in, but the amount of computation it performs can be controlled independently of the input image size. While the model is non-differentiable, it can be trained using reinforcement learning methods to learn task-specific policies. We evaluate our model on several image classification tasks, where it significantly outperforms a convolutional neural network baseline on cluttered images, and on a dynamic visual control problem, where it learns to track a simple object without an explicit training signal for doing so.", "citation": "Citations (793)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "New York University", "Facebook", "Facebook", "New York University", "Facebook", "University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Adobe Systems", "National University of Singapore", "Sun Yat-sen University", "National University of Singapore", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Microsoft", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Northeastern University", "Res.
