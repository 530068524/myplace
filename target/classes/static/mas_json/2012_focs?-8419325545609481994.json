{"title": "Constructive Discrepancy Minimization by Walking on the Edges.", "fields": ["randomized algorithm", "rounding", "linear algebra", "constructive", "lemma", "universe"], "abstract": "Minimizing the discrepancy of a set system is a fundamental problem in combinatorics. One of the cornerstones in this area is the celebrated six standard deviations result of Spencer (AMS 1985): In any system of $n$ sets in a universe of size $n$, there always exists a coloring which achieves discrepancy $6\\sqrt{n}$. The original proof of Spencer was existential in nature, and did not give an efficient algorithm to find such a coloring. Recently, a breakthrough work of Bansal (FOCS 2010) gave an efficient algorithm which finds such a coloring. His algorithm was based on an SDP relaxation of the discrepancy problem and a clever rounding procedure. In this work we give a new randomized algorithm to find a coloring as in Spencer's result based on a restricted random walk we call {\\sl Edge-Walk}. Our algorithm and its analysis use only basic linear algebra and is ``truly'' constructive in that it does not appeal to the existential arguments, giving a new proof of Spencer's theorem and the {\\sl partial coloring lemma}.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Institute for Advanced Study", "Institute for Advanced Study"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar", "Raghu Meka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meka:Raghu"], "pages": 7}
