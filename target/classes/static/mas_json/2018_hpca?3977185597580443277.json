{"title": "Warp Scheduling for Fine-Grained Synchronization.", "fields": ["synchronization", "spin", "busy waiting", "denial of service attack", "parallel algorithm"], "abstract": "Fine-grained synchronization is employed in many parallel algorithms and is often implemented using busy-wait synchronization (e.g., spin locks). However, busy-wait synchronization incurs significant overheads and existing CPU solutions do not readily translate to single-instruction, multiple-thread (SIMT) graphics processor unit (GPU) architectures. In this paper, we propose Back-Off Warp Spinning (BOWS), a hardware warp scheduling policy that extends existing warp scheduling policies to temporarily deprioritize warps executing busy wait code. In addition, we propose Dynamic Detection of Spinning (DDOS), a novel hardware mechanism for accurately and efficiently detecting busy-wait synchronization on GPUs. On a set of GPU kernels employing busy-wait synchronization, DDOS identifies all busy-wait loops incurring no false detections. BOWS improves performance by 1.5\u00d7 and reduces energy consumption by 1.6\u00d7 versus Criticality-Aware Warp Acceleration (CAWA) [14].,,,,", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Ahmed ElTantawy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/ElTantawy:Ahmed", "Tor M.
