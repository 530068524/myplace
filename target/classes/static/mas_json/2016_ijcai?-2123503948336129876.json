We introduce a generalization of the Overload Check and Edge-Finder rules based on a function computing the earliest completion time for a set of tasks. Depending on the relaxation used to compute this function, one obtains different levels of filtering. We present two algorithms that enforce these rules. The algorithms utilize a novel data structure that we call Profile and that encodes the resource utilization over time. Experiments show that these algorithms are competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms, by doing a greater filtering and having a faster runtime.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Laval University", "Laval University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Vincent Gingras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gingras:Vincent", "Claude-Guy Quimper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quimper:Claude=Guy"], "pages": 7}
