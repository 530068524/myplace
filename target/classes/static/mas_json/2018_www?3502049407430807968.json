{"title": "A Fast Deep Learning Model for Textual Relevance in Biomedical Information Retrieval.", "fields": ["learning to rank", "online search", "training set", "vocabulary", "deep learning"], "abstract": "Publications in the life sciences are characterized by a large technical vocabulary, with many lexical and semantic variations for expressing the same concept. Towards addressing the problem of relevance in biomedical literature search, we introduce a deep learning model for the relevance of a document\u2019s text to a keyword style query. Limited by a relatively small amount of training data, the model uses pre-trained word embeddings. With these, the model first computes a variable-length Delta matrix between the query and document, representing a difference between the two texts, which is then passed through a deep convolution stage followed by a deep feed-forward network to compute a relevance score. This results in a fast model suitable for use in an online search engine. The model is robust and outperforms comparable state-of-the art deep learning approaches.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Chan Zuckerberg ...
