However, neither of these schemes can efficiently handle mixed workloads with both short running interactive queries as well as long running batch queries nor do these schemes efficiently support a wide range of different cluster setups which vary in cluster size and other parameters such as the mean time between failures. In this paper, we present a novel cost-based fault-tolerance scheme which tackles this issue. Compared to the existing schemes, our scheme selects a subset of intermediates to be materialized such that the total query runtime is minimized under mid-query failures. Our experiments show that our cost-based fault-tolerance scheme outperforms all existing strategies and always selects the sweet spot for short- and long running queries as well as for different cluster setups.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Cooperative State University", "Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Cooperative State University", "Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Abdallah Salama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salama:Abdallah", "Carsten Binnig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Binnig:Carsten", "Tim Kraska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraska:Tim", "Erfan Zamanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zamanian:Erfan"], "pages": 13}
