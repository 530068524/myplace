This resolves a conjecture of Rene Beier. Moreover, we give polynomial bounds on all finite moments of the number of Pareto-optimal solutions, which yields the first non-trivial concentration bound for this quantity. Using our new technique, we give a complete characterization of polynomial smoothed complexity for binary optimization problems, which strengthens an earlier result due to Beier and Vocking.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Maastricht University", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Heiko R\u00f6glin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=ouml=glin:Heiko", "Shang-Hua Teng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teng:Shang=Hua"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
