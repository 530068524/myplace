It is known an interesting connection between multi-agent learning algorithms and evolutionary game theory, showing that the learning dynamics of some algorithms can be modeled as replicator dynamics with a mutation term. Inspired by the recent sequence-form replicator dynamics, we develop a new version of the Q-learning algorithm working on the sequence form of an extensive-form game allowing thus an exponential reduction of the dynamics length w.r.t. those of the normal form. The dynamics of the proposed algorithm can be modeled by using the sequence-form replicator dynamics with a mutation term. We show that, although sequence-form and normal-form replicator dynamics are realization equivalent, the Q-learning algorithm applied to the two forms have nonrealization equivalent dynamics. Originally from the previous works on evolutionary game theory models form multi-agent learning, we produce an experimental evaluation to show the accuracy of the model.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Fabio Panozzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panozzo:Fabio", "Nicola Gatti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gatti_0001:Nicola", "Marcello Restelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Restelli:Marcello"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
