We formulate various requirements for a fully-fledged KGMS. In particular, such a system must be capable of performing complex reasoning tasks but, at the same time, achieve efficient and scalable reasoning over Big Data with an acceptable computational complexity. Moreover, a KGMS needs interfaces to corporate databases, the web, and machine-learning and analytics packages. We present KRR formalisms and a system achieving these goals. To this aim, we use specific suitable fragments from the Datalog\\(^\\pm \\) family of languages, and we introduce the vadalog system, which puts these swift logics into action. This system exploits the theoretical underpinning of relevant Datalog\\(^\\pm \\) languages and combines it with existing and novel techniques from database and AI practice.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Vienna University of Technology", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Vienna University of Technology", "School of Informatics"], "authors": ["Luigi Bellomarini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellomarini:Luigi", "Georg Gottlob.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottlob:Georg", "Andreas Pieris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pieris:Andreas", "Emanuel Sallinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sallinger:Emanuel"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
