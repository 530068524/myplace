However, when the target posterior is multimodal, mixing performance is often poor. This results in inadequate exploration of the posterior distribution. A framework is proposed to improve the sampling efficiency of stochastic gradient MCMC, based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. A generalized kinetic function is leveraged, delivering superior stationary mixing, especially for multimodal distributions. Techniques are also discussed to overcome the practical issues introduced by this generalization. It is shown that the proposed approach is better at exploring complex multimodal posterior distributions, as demonstrated on multiple applications and in comparison with other stochastic gradient MCMC methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Duke University", "University at Buffalo", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yizhe Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yizhe", "Changyou Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Changyou", "Zhe Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Zhe", "Ricardo Henao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henao:Ricardo", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "pages": 10}
