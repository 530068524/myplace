Many older people find cheques valuable as a means of payment but the UK Payments Council recently proposed their abolition. We describe two designs that simultaneously aimed to preserve and augment the paper cheque as a means of making electronic payments. These were devised during participatory design workshops through critical dialogues with our eighty something participants. Workshop discussions resulted in the creation of a real world cheque system where we issued pre-paid cheques without the involvement of banks. This work informed the development of a digital cheque book based on Anoto digital pen technology. The work illustrates the value of participatory design with 'extraordinary' users, such as the eighty somethings, in HCI.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "departments": ["Northumbria University", "Northumbria University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "authors": ["John Vines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vines:John", "Mark Blythe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blythe:Mark", "Paul Dunphy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunphy:Paul", "Vasillis Vlachokyriakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vlachokyriakos:Vasillis", "Isaac Teece.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teece:Isaac", "Andrew Monk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monk:Andrew", "Patrick Olivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivier:Patrick"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
