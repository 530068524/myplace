{"title": "Safe Memory-Leak Fixing for C Programs.", "fields": ["source lines of code", "handle leak", "regression testing", "software bug", "memory leak"], "abstract": "Automatic bug fixing has become a promising direction for reducing manual effort in debugging. However, general approaches to automatic bug fixing may face some fundamental difficulties. In this paper, we argue that automatic fixing of specific types of bugs can be a useful complement.   This paper reports our first attempt towards automatically fixing memory leaks in C programs. Our approach generates only safe fixes, which are guaranteed not to interrupt normal execution of the program. To design such an approach, we have to deal with several challenging problems such as inter-procedural leaks, global variables, loops, and leaks from multiple allocations. We propose solutions to all the problems and integrate the solutions into a coherent approach.   We implemented our inter-procedural memory leak fixing into a tool named  LeakFix  and evaluated  LeakFix  on 15 programs with 522k lines of code. Our evaluation shows that  LeakFix  is able to successfully fix a substantial number of memory leaks, and  LeakFix  is scalable for large applications.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Qing Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Qing", "Yingfei Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Yingfei", "Yaqing Mi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mi:Yaqing", "Lu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0023:Lu", "Weikun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Weikun", "Zhaoping Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhaoping", "Bing Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Bing", "Hong Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Hong"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
