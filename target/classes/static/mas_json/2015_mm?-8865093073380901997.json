However, from a recognition point of view, one can also study various orderings and properties of the primitive strokes that compose the sketch. Studying sketches in this manner has enabled us to create novel sparse yet discriminative sketch-based representations for object categories which we term  category-epitomes . Concurrently, the epitome construction provides a natural measure for quantifying the sparseness underlying the original sketch, which we term epitome-score. We analyze  category-epitomes  and epitome-scores for hand-drawn sketches from a sketch dataset of 160 object categories commonly encountered in daily life. Our analysis provides a novel viewpoint for examining the complexity of representation for visual object categories.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarvadevabhatla:Ravi_Kiran", "R.
