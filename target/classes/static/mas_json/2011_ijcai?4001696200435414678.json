In many real situations, some quantitative information about event duration or inter-event delay is necessary to discriminate phenomena. We propose the algorithm QTIPrefixSpan for extracting temporal patterns composed of events to which temporal intervals describing their position in time and their duration are associated. It extends algorithm PrefixSpan with a multi-dimensional interval clustering step for extracting the representative temporal intervals associated to events in patterns. Experiments on simulated data show that our algorithm is efficient for extracting precise patterns even in noisy contexts and that it improves the performance of a former algorithm which used a clustering method based on the EM algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "OUEST, Rennes Cedex, France"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Thomas Guyet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guyet:Thomas", "Rene Quiniou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quiniou:Rene"], "pages": 6}
