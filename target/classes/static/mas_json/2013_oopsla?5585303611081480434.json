Our techniques build on top of an algorithm for satisfiability modulo recursive functions, a framework for deductive synthesis, and complete synthesis procedures for algebraic data types. We present new counterexample-guided algorithms for constructing verified programs. We have implemented these algorithms in an integrated environment for interactive verification and synthesis from relational specifications. Our system was able to synthesize a number of useful recursive functions that manipulate unbounded numbers and data structures.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Etienne Kneuss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kneuss:Etienne", "Ivan Kuraj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuraj:Ivan", "Viktor Kuncak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuncak:Viktor", "Philippe Suter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suter:Philippe"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2013", "pages": 20}
