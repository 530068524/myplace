They are general enough to capture aggregate logic programs as well as recently proposed description logic programs. In this paper, we propose a well-founded semantics for basic logic programs with arbitrary abstract constraint atoms, which are sets of rules whose heads have exactly one atom. We show that similar to the well-founded semantics of normal logic programs, it has many desirable properties such as that it can be computed in polynomial time, and is always correct with respect to the answer set semantics. This paves the way for using our well-founded semantics to simplify these logic programs. We also show how our semantics can be applied to aggregate logic programs and description logic programs, and compare it to the well-founded semantics already proposed for these logic programs.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Guizhou University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "University of Alberta", "Guizhou Academy ...
