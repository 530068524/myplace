Many VE applications would be improved if a bobbing-free path were available. This paper introduces a model that describes head position while walking in terms of a bobbing free path and the head bobs. We introduce two methods to approximate the model from head-track data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Sandia National Laboratories", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Jeremy D.
