Many auction-based incentive mechanisms have been proposed to stimulate smartphone users to participate in crowdsensing. However, none of them have taken into consideration the Sybil attack where a user illegitimately pretends multiple identities to gain benefits. This attack may undermine existing inventive mechanisms. To deter the Sybil attack, we design Sybil-proof auction-based incentive mechanisms for crowdsensing in this paper. We investigate both the single-minded and multi-minded cases and propose SPIM-S and SPIM-M, respectively. SPIM-S achieves computational efficiency, individual rationality, truthfulness, and Sybil-proofness. SPIM-M achieves individual rationality, truthfulness, and Sybil-proofness. We evaluate the performance and validate the desired properties of SPIM-S and SPIM-M through extensive simulations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Colorado School of Mines", "Colorado School of Mines", "Colorado School of Mines", "Arizona State University", "Syracuse University"], "authors": ["Jian Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Jian", "Ming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0044:Ming", "Dejun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Dejun", "Guoliang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Guoliang", "Jian Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0008:Jian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
