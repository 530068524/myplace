It is easy to note that local regions of the face change differently in appearance as the viewpoint varies. Recently, patch-based approaches, such as those of Kanade and Yamada, have taken advantage of this effect resulting in improved viewpoint invariant face recognition. In this paper we propose a data-driven extension to their approach, in which we not only model how a face patch varies in appearance, but also how it deforms spatially as the viewpoint varies. We propose a novel alignment strategy which we refer to as ldquostack flowrdquo that discovers viewpoint induced spatial deformities undergone by a face at the patch level. One can then view the spatial deformation of a patch as the correspondence of that patch between two viewpoints. We present improved identification and verification results to demonstrate the utility of our technique.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ahmed Bilal Ashraf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ashraf:Ahmed_Bilal", "Simon Lucey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucey:Simon", "Tsuhan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Tsuhan"], "pages": -1}
