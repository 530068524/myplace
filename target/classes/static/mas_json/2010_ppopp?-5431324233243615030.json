{"title": "A practical concurrent binary search tree.", "fields": ["software transactional memory", "skip list", "optimistic concurrency control", "avl tree", "serializability"], "abstract": "We propose a concurrent relaxed balance AVL tree algorithm that is fast, scales well, and tolerates contention. It is based on optimistic techniques adapted from software transactional memory, but takes advantage of specific knowledge of the the algorithm to reduce overheads and avoid unnecessary retries. We extend our algorithm with a fast linearizable clone operation, which can be used for consistent iteration of the tree. Experimental evidence shows that our algorithm outperforms a highly tuned concurrent skip list for many access patterns, with an average of 39% higher single-threaded throughput and 32% higher multi-threaded throughput over a range of contention levels and operation mixes.", "citation": "Citations (172)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Nathan Grasso Bronson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bronson:Nathan_Grasso", "Jared Casper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casper:Jared", "Hassan Chafi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chafi:Hassan", "Kunle Olukotun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olukotun:Kunle"], "pages": 12}
