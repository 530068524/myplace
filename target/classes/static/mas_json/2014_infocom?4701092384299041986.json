The crux of the problem is to achieve energy efficiency, which has been demonstrated to be difficult by prior work. In this paper we propose Hello, a generic flexible protocol for neighbor discovery. With an unrestricted parameter, it serves as a generic framework that incorporates existing deterministic protocols. Under the framework, we expose optimal parameters for either symmetric or asymmetric duty cycles, which is the first to our knowledge. As a result, it exhibits great flexibility by adjusting itself to any configuration that best meets application demands. Besides, several techniques are applied to removing redundant discoveries without sacrificing the worst-case latency. We evaluate Hello through extensive simulation and real-world sensor experiments. The results show that Hello is highly energy-efficient under symmetric and asymmetric duty cycles. In particular, it is two times better than the state of the art in terms of the worst-case latency under asymmetric duty cycles.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Wei Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Wei", "Zheng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Zheng", "Keyu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Keyu", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
