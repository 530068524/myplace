To enable versatile publishing, we introduce the Guardian Normal Form (GNF), a novel method of publishing multiple sub-tables such that each sub-table is anonymized by an existing QI-SA publishing algorithm, while the combination of all published tables guarantees all privacy rules. We devise two algorithms, Guardian Decomposition (GD) and Utility-aware Decomposition (UAD), for decomposing a microdata table into GNF, and present extensive experiments over real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of both algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["George Washington University", "George Washington University", "George Washington University", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "authors": ["Xin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xin", "Mingyang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Mingyang", "Nan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Nan", "Gautam Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das_0001:Gautam"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
