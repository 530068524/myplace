{"title": "Virtualize Everything but Time.", "fields": ["synchronization", "live migration", "architecture", "testbed", "feed forward"], "abstract": "We propose a new timekeeping architecture for virtualized systems, in the context of Xen. Built upon a feedforward based RADclock synchronization algorithm, it ensures that the clocks in each OS sharing the hardware derive from a single central clock in a resource effective way, and that this clock is both accurate and robust. A key advantage is simple, seamless VM migration with consistent time. In contrast, the current Xen approach for timekeeping behaves very poorly under live migration, posing a major problem for applications such as financial transactions, gaming, and network measurement, which are critically dependent on reliable timekeeping. We also provide a detailed examination of the HPET and Xen Clocksource counters. Results are validated using a hardware-supported testbed.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Timothy Broomhead.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broomhead:Timothy", "Laurence Cremean.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cremean:Laurence", "Julien Ridoux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ridoux:Julien", "Darryl Veitch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veitch:Darryl"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2010", "pages": 14}
