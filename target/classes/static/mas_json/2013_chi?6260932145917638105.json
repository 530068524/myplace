Touchbugs are active tangibles that are able to move across surfaces by employing vibrating motors and can communicate with camera based multi-touch surfaces using infrared LEDs. Touchbug's embedded inertial sensors and computational capabilities open a new interaction space by providing autonomous capabilities for tangibles that allow goal directed behavior.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "authors": ["Diana Nowacka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nowacka:Diana", "Karim Ladha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ladha:Karim", "Nils Y.
