{"title": "High-quality shape from multi-view stereo and shading under general illumination.", "fields": ["harmonic analysis", "shading", "computer vision", "computer graphics images", "iterative reconstruction"], "abstract": "Multi-view stereo methods reconstruct 3D geometry from images well for sufficiently textured scenes, but often fail to recover high-frequency surface detail, particularly for smoothly shaded surfaces. On the other hand, shape-from-shading methods can recover fine detail from shading variations. Unfortunately, it is non-trivial to apply shape-from-shading alone to multi-view data, and most shading-based estimation methods only succeed under very restricted or controlled illumination. We present a new algorithm that combines multi-view stereo and shading-based refinement for high-quality reconstruction of 3D geometry models from images taken under constant but otherwise arbitrary illumination. We have tested our algorithm on several scenes that were captured under several general and unknown lighting conditions, and we show that our final reconstructions rival laser range scans.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "MPI Informatik", "MPI Informatik"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chenglei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Chenglei", "Bennett Wilburn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilburn:Bennett", "Yasuyuki Matsushita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsushita:Yasuyuki", "Christian Theobalt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobalt:Christian"], "pages": 8}
