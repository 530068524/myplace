Furthermore, when a failure is detected, the rollout is stopped and the software can be automatically removed from those computers that already were updated. The software update can be stored originally at an address that is inaccessible through the network firewall by intermediately uploading the software update to an update computer which is not a part of the network but has access through the firewall, which is then used to distribute the update.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "AT&T Labs", "Michigan State University", "AT&T Labs", "\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'informatique et de math\u00e9matiques appliqu\u00e9es de Grenoble", "Lumension Secur ... tsdale, AZ, US)", "Lumension Secur ... tsdale, AZ, US)", "Lumension Secur ... tsdale, AZ, US)", "Lumension Secur ... tsdale, AZ, US)", "Lumension Secur ... tsdale, AZ, US)", "NII, Japan"], "authors": ["Amir R.
