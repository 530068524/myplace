Our framework subsumes step indexed realizability semantics by untyped call-by-value lambda calculi as well as categorical abstract machines. Starting from an extension of Hofstra's basic combinatorial objects, we construct a step indexed categorical realizability semantics. Our main result is soundness and adequacy of our step indexed realizability semantics. As an application, we show that a small step operational semantics captures the big step operational semantics of the call-by-value polymorphic lambda calculus. We also give a safe implementation of the call-by-value polymorphic lambda calculus into a categorical abstract machine.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Kyoto University"], "authors": ["Naohiko Hoshino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoshino:Naohiko"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
