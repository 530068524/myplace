For complex domains (e.g., positive semidefinite cone), the projection step can be computationally expensive, making stochastic gradient descent unattractive for large-scale optimization problems. We address this limitation by developing novel stochastic optimization algorithms that do not need intermediate projections. Instead, only one projection at the last iteration is needed to obtain a feasible solution in the given domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that with a high probability, the proposed algorithms achieve an O(1/\u221aT) convergence rate for general convex optimization, and an O(ln T/T) rate for strongly convex optimization under mild conditions about the domain and the objective function.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "General Electric", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "NEC Laboratories America, CA"], "authors": ["Mehrdad Mahdavi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahdavi:Mehrdad", "Tianbao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Tianbao", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong", "Shenghuo Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Shenghuo", "Jinfeng Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Jinfeng"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
