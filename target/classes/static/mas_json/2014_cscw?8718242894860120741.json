{"title": "Facebook makes the heart grow fonder: relationship maintenance strategies among geographically dispersed and communication-restricted connections.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "interpersonal communication", "information and communications technology", "computer mediated communication", "relationship maintenance"], "abstract": "The increasing ubiquity of information and communication technologies has dramatically impacted interpersonal communication and relationship maintenance processes. These technologies remove temporal and spatial constraints, enabling communication at a distance for low to no physical costs. Research has established that technologies such as email supplement other forms of communication in relationship maintenance, but to what extent do newer technologies--which contain a unique set of affordances--facilitate these processes? Furthermore, do SNS users engage in different practices through the site and obtain different relational benefits based on specific characteristics of the tie? Findings from a survey of adult Facebook users (N=415) indicate that geographically distant Facebook Friends, as well as those who rely on the site as their primary form of communication, engage in relationship maintenance strategies through the site to a greater extent and perceive the site to have a more positive impact on the quality of their relationships.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Jessica Vitak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitak:Jessica"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
