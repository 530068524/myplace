The introduced formalism leads to semantics of manipulation action and has applications to both observing and understanding human manipulation actions as well as executing them with a robotic mechanism (e.g. a humanoid robot). It is based on a Combinatory Categorial Grammar. The goal of the introduced framework is to: (1) represent manipulation actions with both syntax and semantic parts, where the semantic part employs $\\lambda$-calculus; (2) enable a probabilistic semantic parsing schema to learn the $\\lambda$-calculus representation of manipulation action from an annotated action corpus of videos; (3) use (1) and (2) to develop a system that visually observes manipulation actions and understands their meaning while it can reason beyond observations using propositional logic and axiom schemata. The experiments conducted on a public available large manipulation action dataset validate the theoretical framework and our implementation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yezhou Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yezhou", "Yiannis Aloimonos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aloimonos:Yiannis", "Cornelia Ferm\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferm=uuml=ller:Cornelia", "Eren Erdal Aksoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aksoy:Eren_Erdal"], "pages": 11}
