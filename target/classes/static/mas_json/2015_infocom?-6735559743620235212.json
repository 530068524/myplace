Together with a recently developed concept of an arrival-martingale, the proposed service-martingale concept enables the queueing analysis of a bursty source sharing a MAC channel. In particular, the paper derives the first rigorous and accurate stochastic delay bounds for a Markovian source sharing either an Aloha or CSMA/CA channel, and further considers two extended scenarios accounting for 1) in-source scheduling and 2) spatial multiplexing MIMO. By leveraging the powerful martingale methodology, the obtained bounds are remarkably tight and improve state-of-the-art bounds by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, the obtained bounds indicate that MIMO spatial multiplexing is subject to the fundamental power-of-two phenomena.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "University of Warwick"], "authors": ["Felix Poloczek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poloczek:Felix", "Florin Ciucu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciucu:Florin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
