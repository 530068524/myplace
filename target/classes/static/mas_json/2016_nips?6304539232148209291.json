{"title": "Learning Influence Functions from Incomplete Observations.", "fields": ["learnability", "reachability", "graph", "heuristic", "observable"], "abstract": "We study the problem of learning influence functions under incomplete observations of node activations. Incomplete observations are a major concern as most (online and real-world) social networks are not fully observable. We establish both proper and improper PAC learnability of influence functions under randomly missing observations. Proper PAC learnability under the Discrete-Time Linear Threshold (DLT) and Discrete-Time Independent Cascade (DIC) models is established by reducing incomplete observations to complete observations in a modified graph. Our improper PAC learnability result applies for the DLT and DIC models as well as the Continuous-Time Independent Cascade (CIC) model. It is based on a parametrization in terms of reachability features, and also gives rise to an efficient and practical heuristic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of our method to compensate even for a fairly large fraction of missing observations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Xinran He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xinran", "Ke Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ke", "David Kempe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kempe_0001:David", "Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
