Extending our result for the Harsanyi-Selten process, we show that several other homotopy-based algorithms for finding equilibria of games are also PSPACE-complete to implement. A further application of our techniques yields the result that it is PSPACE-complete to compute any of the equilibria that could be found via the classical Lemke-Howson algorithm, a complexity-theoretic strengthening of the result in Savani and von Stengel [2006]. These results show that our techniques can be widely applied and suggest that the PSPACE-completeness of implementing homotopy methods is a general principle.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Liverpool", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Liverpool", "University of Liverpool", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Liverpool"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Paul W.
