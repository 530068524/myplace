The method is applicable to any reversible chain whose states are not connected through a tree, and can be interpreted graphically as inserting vortices into the state transition graph. Our result confirms that non-reversible chains are fundamentally better than reversible ones in terms of asymptotic performance, and suggests interesting directions for further improving MCMC.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research"], "authors": ["Yi Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0003:Yi", "Faustino J.
