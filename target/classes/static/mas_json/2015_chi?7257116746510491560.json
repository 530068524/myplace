{"title": "Regulating Access to Adult Content (with Privacy Preservation).", "fields": ["cued speech", "recall", "exploit", "service provider", "declaration"], "abstract": "In the physical world we have well-established mechanisms for keeping children out of adult-only areas. In the virtual world this is generally replaced by self declaration. Some service providers resort to using heavy-weight identification mechanisms, judging adulthood as a side effect thereof. Collection of identification data arguably constitutes an unwarranted privacy invasion in this context, if carried out merely to perform adulthood estimation. This paper presents a mechanism that exploits the adult's more extensive exposure to public media, relying on the likelihood that they will be able to recall details if cued by a carefully chosen picture. We conducted an online study to gauge the viability of this scheme. With our prototype we were able to predict that the user was a child 99% of the time. Unfortunately the scheme also misclassified too many adults. We discuss our results and suggest directions for future research.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Karen Renaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Renaud:Karen", "Joseph Maguire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maguire:Joseph"], "pages": 10}
