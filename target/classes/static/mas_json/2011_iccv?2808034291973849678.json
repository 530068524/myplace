{"title": "Efficient regression of general-activity human poses from depth images.", "fields": ["data set", "pose", "test set", "frame rate", "intermediate language"], "abstract": "We present a new approach to general-activity human pose estimation from depth images, building on Hough forests. We extend existing techniques in several ways: real time prediction of multiple 3D joints, explicit learning of voting weights, vote compression to allow larger training sets, and a comparison of several decision-tree training objectives. Key aspects of our work include: regression directly from the raw depth image, without the use of an arbitrary intermediate representation; applicability to general motions (not constrained to particular activities) and the ability to localize occluded as well as visible body joints. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces state of the art results on several data sets including the challenging MSRC-5000 pose estimation test set, at a speed of about 200 frames per second. Results on silhouettes suggest broader applicability to other imaging modalities.", "citation": "Citations (373)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ross B.
