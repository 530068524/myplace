Specifically if a node set S graph separates nodes u and v then Xu is conditionally independent of Xv given XS. The opposite direction need not be true, that is, Xu \u22a5 Xv | XS need not imply S is a node separator of u and v. When it does, the relation Xu \u22a5 Xv | XS is called faithful. In this paper we provide a characterization of faithful relations and then provide an algorithm to test faithfulness based only on knowledge of other conditional relations of the form Xi \u22a5 Xj | XS.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["De Wen Soh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soh:De_Wen", "Sekhar C.
