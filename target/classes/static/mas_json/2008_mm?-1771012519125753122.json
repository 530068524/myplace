A panorama is generated from background video, with foreground objects removed by video inpainting technique. A video planning script is provided by the user on the panorama with accurate timing of actors. Actions of these actors are extensions of existing cyclic motions, such as walking, tracked and extrapolated using our motion analysis techniques. Although the types of video story generated are limited, however, it is possible to use the mechanism proposed to generate forgery videos. Interested readers should visit our tool demonstration and forgery videos at http://member.mine.tku.edu.tw/www/ACMMM08-VideoPlanning.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tamkang University", "National Taipei University of Education", "Academia Sinica", "Tamkang University", "Tamkang University"], "authors": ["Nick C.
