{"title": "Mining Informal Language from Chinese Microtext: Joint Word Recognition and Segmentation.", "fields": ["text segmentation", "delimiter", "microblogging", "exploit", "social media"], "abstract": "We address the problem of informal word recognition in Chinese microblogs. A key problem is the lack of word delimiters in Chinese. We exploit this reliance as an opportunity: recognizing the relation between informal word recognition and Chinese word segmentation, we propose to model the two tasks jointly. Our joint inference method significantly outperforms baseline systems that conduct the tasks individually or sequentially.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Aobo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Aobo", "Min-Yen Kan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kan:Min=Yen"], "pages": 11}
