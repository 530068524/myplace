{"title": "Information Extraction over Structured Data: Question Answering with Freebase.", "fields": ["natural language", "information extraction", "question answering", "data model", "parsing"], "abstract": "Answering natural language questions using the Freebase knowledge base has recently been explored as a platform for advancing the state of the art in open domain semantic parsing. Those efforts map questions to sophisticated meaning representations that are then attempted to be matched against viable answer candidates in the knowledge base. Here we show that relatively modest information extraction techniques, when paired with a webscale corpus, can outperform these sophisticated approaches by roughly 34% relative gain.", "citation": "Citations (208)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xuchen Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Xuchen", "Benjamin Van Durme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durme:Benjamin_Van"], "pages": 11}
