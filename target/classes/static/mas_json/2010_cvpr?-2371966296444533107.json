Visual context has been successfully used in object detection tasks, however, it is often ignored in object tracking. We propose a method to learn supporters which are, be it only temporally, useful for determining the position of the object of interest. Our approach exploits the General Hough Transform strategy. It couples the supporters with the target and naturally distinguishes between strongly and weakly coupled motions. By this, the position of an object can be estimated even when it is not seen directly (e.g., fully occluded or outside of the image region) or when it changes its appearance quickly and significantly. Experiments show substantial improvements in model-free tracking as well as in the tracking of \u201cvirtual\u201d points, e.g., in medical applications.", "citation": "Citations (252)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "ETH Zurich", "University of Basel"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Helmut Grabner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grabner:Helmut", "Jiri Matas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matas:Jiri", "Luc J.
