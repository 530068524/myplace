We exploit the impact of the prior distribution in mitigating the influence of individual data points. In particular, we focus on sampling from an exponential family and specific generalized linear models, such as logistic regression. We propose novel RDP mechanisms as well as offering a new RDP analysis for an existing method in order to add value to the RDP framework. Each method is capable of achieving arbitrary RDP privacy guarantees, and we offer experimental results of their efficacy.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Joseph Geumlek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geumlek:Joseph", "Shuang Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Shuang", "Kamalika Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Kamalika"], "pages": 10}
