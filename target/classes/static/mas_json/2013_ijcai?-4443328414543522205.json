By analogy to causal AR(1) processes with non-Gaussian noise, we conjecture that the distribution of the time reversed residuals of a linear VAR model is closer to a Gaussian than the distribution of actual residuals in the forward direction. Experiments with simulated data illustrate the validity of the conjecture. Based on these results, we design a decision rule for detecting the direction of VAR processes. The correct direction in time (forward) is the one in which the residuals of the time series are less Gaussian. A series of experiments illustrate the superior results of the proposed rule when compared with other methods based on independence tests.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Madrid", "Autonomous University of Madrid", "Autonomous University of Madrid"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Pablo Morales-Mombiela.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morales=Mombiela:Pablo", "Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hern=aacute=ndez=Lobato:Daniel", "Alberto Su\u00e1rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su=aacute=rez_0001:Alberto"], "pages": 7}
