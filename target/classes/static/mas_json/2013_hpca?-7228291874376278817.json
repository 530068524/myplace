{"title": "A multiple SIMD, multiple data (MSMD) architecture: Parallel execution of dynamic and static SIMD fragments.", "fields": ["data architecture", "architecture", "benchmark", "control flow", "simd"], "abstract": "The efficacy of widely used single instruction, multiple data architectures is often limited when handling divergent control flows and short vectors; both circumstances result in SIMD fragments that use only a subset of the available datapaths. This paper proposes a multiple SIMD, multiple data (MSMD) architecture with flexible SIMD datapaths that can be dynamically or statically repartitioned among multiple control flow paths, all executing simultaneously. The benefits are twofold: SIMD fragments resulting from divergent branches can execute in parallel, as can multiple kernels with short vectors. The resulting SIMD architecture can achieve the flexibility similar to a multiple instruction, multiple data architecture. We have both simulated the architecture and implemented a prototype. Our experiments with data-parallel benchmarks show that the architecture leads to 60% performance gains with an area overhead of only 3.06%.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "University of Virginia", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Yaohua Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yaohua", "Shuming Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shuming", "Jianghua Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Jianghua", "Jiayuan Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Jiayuan", "Kai Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Kai", "Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0013:Wei", "Xi Ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ning:Xi"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
