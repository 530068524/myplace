As a result, effective high order features representing rich contexts are inconvenient to use. In this work, we propose a novel stacked subword model for this task, concerning both efficiency and effectiveness. Our solution is a two step process. First, one word-based segmenter, one character-based segmenter and one local character classifier are trained to produce coarse segmentation and POS information. Second, the outputs of the three predictors are merged into sub-word sequences, which are further bracketed and labeled with POS tags by a fine-grained sub-word tagger. The coarse-to-fine search scheme is efficient, while in the sub-word tagging step rich contextual features can be approximately derived. Evaluation on the Penn Chinese Tree-bank shows that our model yields improvements over the best system reported in the literature.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Weiwei Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Weiwei"], "pages": 10}
