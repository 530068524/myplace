{"title": "On the Aggregation of Argumentation Frameworks.", "fields": ["operator", "management science", "argumentation theory", "rationality", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "We study the problem of aggregation of Dung's abstract argumentation frameworks. Some operators for this aggregation have been proposed, as well as some rationality properties for this process. In this work we study the existing operators and new ones that we propose in light of the proposed properties, highlighting the fact that existing operators do not satisfy a lot of these properties. The conclusions are that on one hand none of the existing operators seem fully satisfactory, but on the other hand some of the properties proposed so far seem also too demanding.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delobelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delobelle:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "S\u00e9bastien Konieczny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konieczny:S=eacute=bastien", "Srdjan Vesic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vesic:Srdjan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
