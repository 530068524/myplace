{"title": "Semantic Parsing with Bayesian Tree Transducers.", "fields": ["top down parsing", "tree kernel", "bottom up parsing", "s attributed grammar", "parsing"], "abstract": "Many semantic parsing models use tree transformations to map between natural language and meaning representation. However, while tree transformations are central to several state-of-the-art approaches, little use has been made of the rich literature on tree automata. This paper makes the connection concrete with a tree transducer based semantic parsing model and suggests that other models can be interpreted in a similar framework, increasing the generality of their contributions. In particular, this paper further introduces a variational Bayesian inference algorithm that is applicable to a wide class of tree transducers, producing state-of-the-art semantic parsing results while remaining applicable to any domain employing probabilistic tree transducers.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Macquarie University", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Bevan K.
