Most recently, CNNs have shown promise on facial AU recognition. However, the learned CNNs are often overfitted and do not generalize well to unseen subjects due to limited AU-coded training images. We proposed a novel Incremental Boosting CNN (IB-CNN) to integrate boosting into the CNN via an incremental boosting layer that selects discriminative neurons from the lower layer and is incrementally updated on successive mini-batches. In addition, a novel loss function that accounts for errors from both the incremental boosted classifier and individual weak classifiers was proposed to fine-tune the IB-CNN. Experimental results on four benchmark AU databases have demonstrated that the IB-CNN yields significant improvement over the traditional CNN and the boosting CNN without incremental learning, as well as outperforming the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods in AU recognition. The improvement is more impressive for the AUs that have the lowest frequencies in the databases.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of South Carolina", "University of South Carolina", "University of South Carolina", "University of South Carolina"], "authors": ["Shizhong Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Shizhong", "Zibo Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Zibo", "Ahmed-Shehab Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Ahmed=Shehab", "Yan Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Yan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
