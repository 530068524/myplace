Beyond existing orderless bag-of-features, local features of an image are first projected to different directions or points to generate a series of ordered bag-of-features, based on which different families of spatial bag-of-features are designed to capture the invariance of object translation, rotation, and scaling. Then the most representative features are selected based on a boosting-like method to generate a new bag-of-features-like vector representation of an image. The proposed retrieval framework works well in image retrieval task owing to the following three properties: 1) the encoding of geometric information of objects for capturing objects' spatial transformation, 2) the supervised feature selection and combination strategy for enhancing the discriminative power, and 3) the representation of bag-of-features for effective image matching and indexing for large scale image retrieval. Extensive experiments on 5000 Oxford building images and 1 million Panoramio images show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed features as well as the retrieval framework.", "citation": "Citations (300)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao_0008:Yang", "Changhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Changhu", "Zhiwei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhiwei", "Liqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Liqing", "Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lei"], "pages": 8}
