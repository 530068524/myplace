We present See Me, See You, a lightweight approach for discriminating user touches on a vision-based tabletop. We contribute a valuable characterization of finger orientation distributions of tabletop users. We exploit this biometric trait with a machine learning approach to allow the system to predict the correct position of users as they touch the surface. We achieve accuracies as high as 98% in simple situations and above 92% in more challenging conditions, such as two-handed tasks. We show high acceptance from users, who can self-correct prediction errors without significant costs. See Me, See You is a viable solution for providing simple yet effective support for multi-user application features on tabletops.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Manitoba", "University of Alberta", "University of Manitoba", "University of Manitoba", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Hong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hong", "Xing-Dong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xing=Dong", "Barrett Ens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ens:Barrett", "Hai-Ning Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Hai=Ning", "Pierre Boulanger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boulanger:Pierre", "Pourang Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Pourang"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
