{"title": "Operational transformation for orthogonal conflict resolution in real-time collaborative 2d editing systems.", "fields": ["conflict resolution", "correctness", "operational transformation", "workspace", "design rationale"], "abstract": "Operational Transformation (OT) is commonly used for conflict resolution in real-time collaborative applications, but none of existing OT techniques is able to solve a special type of conflict - orthogonal conflict, which may occur when concurrent operations are inserting/deleting an arbitrary number of objects in different dimensions of a two-dimensional (2D) workspace, such as spreadsheet documents. This paper is the first to identify and solve the orthogonal conflict problem by extending OT with a new capability of resolving 2D conflicts. Extending OT from one- to two-dimensional conflict resolution is fundamental to the theory and application of OT, and technically challenging as well because 2D orthogonal conflict is different from but intimately related to the one-dimensional positional shifting conflict and necessitates new and integral solutions for multi-dimensional conflicts. In this paper, we present formal definitions of orthogonal conflict, pseudo-code description, design rationale analysis, and correctness verification and complexity analysis of the 2DOT solution.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Chengzheng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Chengzheng", "Hongkai Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Hongkai", "Hongfei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Hongfei"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
