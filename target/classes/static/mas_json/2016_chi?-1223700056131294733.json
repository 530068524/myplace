{"title": "Helping Computers Understand Geographically-Bound Activity Restrictions.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "business system planning", "seven management and planning tools", "polygon", "data mining"], "abstract": "The lack of certain types of geographic data prevents the development of location-aware technologies in a number of important domains. One such type of \"unmapped\" geographic data is space usage rules (SURs), which are defined as geographically-bound activity restrictions (e.g. \"no dogs\", \"no smoking\", \"no fishing\", \"no skateboarding\"). Researchers in the area of human-computer interaction have recently begun to develop techniques for the automated mapping of SURs with the aim of supporting activity planning systems (e.g. one-touch \"Can I Smoke Here?\" apps, SUR-aware vacation planning tools). In this paper, we present a novel SUR mapping technique -- SPtP -- that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 30% for one of the most important components of the SUR mapping pipeline: associating a point observation of a SUR (e.g. a 'no smoking' sign) with the corresponding polygon in which the SUR applies (e.g. the nearby park or the entire campus on which the sign is located). This paper also contributes a series of new SUR benchmark datasets to help further research in this area.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Hamburg", "University of Hamburg", "University of Hasselt", "University of Hasselt", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Marcus Soll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soll:Marcus", "Philipp Naumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naumann:Philipp", "Johannes Sch\u00f6ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=ning:Johannes", "Pavel Andreevich Samsonov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samsonov:Pavel_Andreevich", "Brent J.
