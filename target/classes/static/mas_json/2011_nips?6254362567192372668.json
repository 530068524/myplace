{"title": "A Denoising View of Matrix Completion.", "fields": ["data matrix", "manifold", "curse of dimensionality", "matrix completion", "iterated function"], "abstract": "In matrix completion, we are given a matrix where the values of only some of the entries are present, and we want to reconstruct the missing ones. Much work has focused on the assumption that the data matrix has low rank. We propose a more general assumption based on denoising, so that we expect that the value of a missing entry can be predicted from the values of neighboring points. We propose a nonparametric version of denoising based on local, iterated averaging with mean-shift, possibly constrained to preserve local low-rank manifold structure. The few user parameters required (the denoising scale, number of neighbors and local dimensionality) and the number of iterations can be estimated by cross-validating the reconstruction error. Using our algorithms as a postprocessing step on an initial reconstruction (provided by e.g. a low-rank method), we show consistent improvements with synthetic, image and motion-capture data.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of California, Merced", "University of California, Merced", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Weiran Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Weiran", "Miguel \u00c1.
