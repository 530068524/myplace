{"title": "Improved Regret Bounds for Oracle-Based Adversarial Contextual Bandits.", "fields": ["oracle", "open problem", "binary logarithm", "regret", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "We propose a new oracle-based algorithm, BISTRO+, for the adversarial contextual bandit problem, where either contexts are drawn i.i.d. or the sequence of contexts is known a priori, but where the losses are picked adversarially. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, assuming access to an offline optimization oracle, and enjoys a regret of order $O((KT)^{\\frac{2}{3}}(\\log N)^{\\frac{1}{3}})$, where $K$ is the number of actions, $T$ is the number of iterations, and $N$ is the number of baseline policies. Our result is the first to break the $O(T^{\\frac{3}{4}})$ barrier achieved by recent algorithms, which was left as a major open problem. Our analysis employs the recent relaxation framework of (Rakhlin and Sridharan, ICML'16).", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Princeton University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Vasilis Syrgkanis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Syrgkanis:Vasilis", "Haipeng Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Haipeng", "Akshay Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Akshay", "Robert E.
