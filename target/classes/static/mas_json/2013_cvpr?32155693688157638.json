{"title": "Reconstructing Loopy Curvilinear Structures Using Integer Programming.", "fields": ["global optimization", "curvilinear coordinates", "network topology", "integer programming", "spurious relationship"], "abstract": "We propose a novel approach to automated delineation of linear structures that form complex and potentially loopy networks. This is in contrast to earlier approaches that usually assume a tree topology for the networks. At the heart of our method is an Integer Programming formulation that allows us to find the global optimum of an objective function designed to allow cycles but penalize spurious junctions and early terminations. We demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on a wide range of datasets.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Engin T\u00fcretken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/T=uuml=retken:Engin", "Fethallah Benmansour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benmansour:Fethallah", "Bj\u00f6rn Andres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andres:Bj=ouml=rn", "Hanspeter Pfister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfister:Hanspeter", "Pascal Fua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fua:Pascal"], "pages": 8}
