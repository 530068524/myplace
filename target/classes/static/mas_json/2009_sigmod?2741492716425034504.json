State-of-the-art event stream processing technology experiences significant challenges when faced with out-of-order data arrival including huge system latencies, missing results, and incorrect result generation. We propose two out-of-order handling techniques, conservative and aggressive strategies. We will show the efficiency of our techniques and how they can satisfy various QoS requirements of different applications.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Mingzhu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Mingzhu", "Mo Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Mo", "Ming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0008:Ming", "Denis Golovnya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golovnya:Denis", "Elke A.
