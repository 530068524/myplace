The system receives as input a program, a selection of methods to be tested, and a set of parameters that include a selection of a coverage criterion. It yields as output a set of test cases which guarantee that the selected coverage criterion is achieved. aPET is completely integrated within the language's IDE via Eclipse. The generated test cases can be displayed in textual mode and, besides, it is possible to generate ABSUnit code (i.e., code runnable in a simple framework similar to JUnit to write repeatable tests). The information yield by aPET can be relevant to spot bugs during program development and also to perform regression testing.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Complutense University of Madrid", "Complutense University of Madrid", "Complutense University of Madrid", "SLD Fredhopper, Netherlands"], "authors": ["Elvira Albert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albert:Elvira", "Puri Arenas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arenas:Puri", "Miguel G\u00f3mez-Zamalloa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=oacute=mez=Zamalloa:Miguel", "Peter Y.
