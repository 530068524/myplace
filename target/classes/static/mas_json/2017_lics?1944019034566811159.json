{"title": "Riesz Modal logic for Markov processes.", "fields": ["multimodal logic", "riesz representation theorem", "accessibility relation", "higher order logic", "markov kernel"], "abstract": "We investigate a modal logic for expressing properties of Markov processes whose semantics is real-valued, rather than Boolean, and based on the mathematical theory of Riesz spaces. We use the duality theory of Riesz spaces to provide a connection between Markov processes and the logic. This takes the form of a duality between the category of coalgebras of the Radon monad (modeling Markov processes) and the category of a new class of algebras (algebraizing the logic) which we call modal Riesz spaces. As a result, we obtain a sound and complete axiomatization of the Riesz Modal logic.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University"], "authors": ["Matteo Mio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mio:Matteo", "Robert Furber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furber:Robert", "Radu Mardare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mardare:Radu"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
