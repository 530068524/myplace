{"title": "A Balanced Consistency Maintenance Protocol for Structured P2P Systems.", "fields": ["replication", "consistency model", "dynamic network analysis", "latency", "sliding window protocol"], "abstract": "A fundamental challenge of managing mutable data replication in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system is how to efficiently maintain consistency under various sharing patterns with heterogeneous resource capabilities. This paper presents a framework for balanced consistency maintenance (BCoM) in structured P2P systems. Replica nodes of each object are organized into a tree for disseminating updates, and a sliding window update protocol is developed to bound the consistency. The effect of window size in response to dynamic network conditions, workload updates and resource limits is analyzed through a queueing model. This enables us to balance availability, performance and consistency strictness for various application requirements. On top of the dissemination tree, two enhancements are proposed: a fast recovery scheme to strengthen the robustness against node and link failures; and a node migration policy to remove and prevent the bottleneck for better system performance. Simulations are conducted using P2PSim to evaluate BCoM in comparison to SCOPE \\cite{SCOPE}. The experimental results demonstrate that BCoM significantly improves the availability of SCOPE by lowering the discard rate from almost $100\\%$ to $5\\%$ with slight increase in latency.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside"], "authors": ["Yi Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yi", "Min Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng_0001:Min", "Laxmi N.
