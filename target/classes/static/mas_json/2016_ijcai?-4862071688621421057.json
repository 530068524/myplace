We attempt to identify users who can find prospective popular items. Such visionary users are called observers. By adding observers to a favorite user list, they act to find popular items in advance. To identify efficient observers, we propose a feature selection based framework. This uses a classifier to predict item popularity, where the input features are a set of users who adopted an item before others. By training the classifier with sparse and non-negative constraints, observers are extracted as users whose parameters take a non-zero value. In experiments, we test our approach using real social bookmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach can find popular items in advance more effectively than baseline methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics", "NTT Communicati ... e Laboratories"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Takuya Konishi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konishi:Takuya", "Tomoharu Iwata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwata:Tomoharu", "Kohei Hayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayashi:Kohei", "Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawarabayashi:Ken=ichi"], "pages": 7}
