A main obstacle to its widespread deployment and adoption are the privacy concerns of participating individuals. To tackle this open challenge, this paper presents the design and evaluation of PriSense, a novel solution to privacy-preserving data aggregation in people- centric urban sensing systems. PriSense is based on the concept of data slicing and mixing and can support a wide range of statistical additive and non-additive aggregation functions such as Sum, Average, Variance, Count, Max/Min, Median, Histogram, and Percentile with accurate aggregation results. PriSense can support strong user privacy against a tunable threshold number of colluding users and aggregation servers. The efficacy and efficiency of PriSense are confirmed by thorough analytical and simulation results.", "citation": "Citations (222)", "departments": ["New Jersey Institute of Technology", "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "New Jersey Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jing Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jing", "Rui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Rui", "Yunzhong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunzhong", "Yanchao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanchao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
