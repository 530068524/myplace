{"title": "A General Projection Property for Distribution Families.", "fields": ["unimodality", "portfolio", "univariate", "covariance", "markov decision process"], "abstract": "Surjectivity of linear projections between distribution families with fixed mean and covariance (regardless of dimension) is re-derived by a new proof. We further extend this property to distribution families that respect additional constraints, such as symmetry, unimodality and log-concavity. By combining our results with classic univariate inequalities, we provide new worst-case analyses for natural risk criteria arising in classification, optimization, portfolio selection and Markov decision processes.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yaoliang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yaoliang", "Yuxi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuxi", "Dale Schuurmans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuurmans:Dale", "Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szepesv=aacute=ri:Csaba"], "pages": 9}
