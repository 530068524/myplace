{"title": "iVoLVER: Interactive Visual Language for Visualization Extraction and Reconstruction.", "fields": ["expressive power", "information visualization", "visual analytics", "visual language", "bitmap"], "abstract": "We present the design and implementation of iVoLVER, a tool that allows users to create visualizations without textual programming. iVoLVER is designed to enable flexible acquisition of many types of data (text, colors, shapes, quantities, dates) from multiple source types (bitmap charts, webpages, photographs, SVGs, CSV files) and, within the same canvas, supports transformation of that data through simple widgets to construct interactive animated visuals. Aside from the tool, which is web-based and designed for pen and touch, we contribute the design of the interactive visual language and widgets for extraction, transformation, and representation of data. We demonstrate the flexibility and expressive power of the tool through a set of scenarios, and discuss some of the challenges encountered and how the tool fits within the current infovis tool landscape.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of St Andrews", "University of St Andrews", "University of St Andrews"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gonzalo Gabriel M\u00e9ndez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=eacute=ndez:Gonzalo_Gabriel", "Miguel A.
