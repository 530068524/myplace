{"title": "Programming by Feedback.", "fields": ["software framework", "computer science", "proof of concept", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "This paper advocates a new ML-based programming framework, called Programming by Feedback (PF), which involves a sequence of interactions between the active computer and the user. The latter only provides preference judgments on pairs of solutions supplied by the active computer. The active computer involves two components: the learning component estimates the user's utility function and accounts for the user's (possibly limited) competence; the optimization component explores the search space and returns the most appropriate candidate solution. A proof of principle of the approach is proposed, showing that PF requires a handful of interactions in order to solve some discrete and continuous benchmark problems.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Marc Schoenauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schoenauer:Marc", "Riad Akrour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akrour:Riad", "Mich\u00e8le Sebag.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebag:Mich=egrave=le", "Jean-Christophe Souplet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Souplet:Jean=Christophe"], "pages": 9}
