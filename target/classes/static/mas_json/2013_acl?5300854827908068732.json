{"title": "Fine-grained Semantic Typing of Emerging Entities.", "fields": ["typing", "ontology", "streams", "knowledge base", "information extraction"], "abstract": "Methods for information extraction (IE) and knowledge base (KB) construction have been intensively studied. However, a largely under-explored case is tapping into highly dynamic sources like news streams and social media, where new entities are continuously emerging. In this paper, we present a method for discovering and semantically typing newly emerging out-ofKB entities, thus improving the freshness and recall of ontology-based IE and improving the precision and semantic rigor of open IE. Our method is based on a probabilistic model that feeds weights into integer linear programs that leverage type signatures of relational phrases and type correlation or disjointness constraints. Our experimental evaluation, based on crowdsourced user studies, show our method performing significantly better than prior work.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ndapandula Nakashole.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakashole:Ndapandula", "Tomasz Tylenda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tylenda:Tomasz", "Gerhard Weikum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weikum:Gerhard"], "pages": 10}
