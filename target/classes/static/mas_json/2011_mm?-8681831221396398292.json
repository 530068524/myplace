GPAC is an open source multimedia framework that implements a vast number of components and helps experimenting with different types of multimedia applications. It provides a multimedia packager, some servers and a player for dynamic and interactive multimedia content. In this paper, we present the recent additions to the project which allow experimenting with new applications such as dynamic home networking or rich broadcasting of interactive content on the latest devices, including with 3D displays. Such experiments can be useful in research work and, as illustrated, in academic environment for educational purposes.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Jean Le Feuvre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feuvre:Jean_Le", "Cyril Concolato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Concolato:Cyril", "Jean-Claude Dufourd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dufourd:Jean=Claude", "Romain Bouqueau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouqueau:Romain", "Jean-Claude Moissinac.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moissinac:Jean=Claude"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
