{"title": "Removing gamification from an enterprise SNS.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "game mechanics", "social software", "social network", "incentive"], "abstract": "Gamification, the use of game mechanics in non-gaming applications, has been applied to various systems to encourage desired user behaviors. In this paper, we examine patterns of user activity in an enterprise social network service after the removal of a points-based incentive system. Our results reveal that the removal of the incentive scheme did reduce overall participation via contribution within the SNS. We also describe the strategies by point leaders and observe that users geographically distant from headquarters tended to comment on profiles outside of their home country. Finally, we describe the implications of the removal of extrinsic rewards, such as points and badges, on social software systems, particularly those deployed within an enterprise.", "citation": "Citations (266)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Jennifer Thom-Santelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thom=Santelli:Jennifer", "David R.
