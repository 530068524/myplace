{"title": "Scalable Non-linear Learning with Adaptive Polynomial Expansions.", "fields": ["polynomial", "nonlinear system", "computation", "scalability", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Can we effectively learn a nonlinear representation in time comparable to linear learning? We describe a new algorithm that explicitly and adaptively expands higher-order interaction features over base linear representations. The algorithm is designed for extreme computational efficiency, and an extensive experimental study shows that its computation/prediction tradeoff ability compares very favorably against strong baselines.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Yahoo!", "Columbia University", "Microsoft", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alekh Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Alekh", "Alina Beygelzimer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beygelzimer:Alina", "Daniel J.
