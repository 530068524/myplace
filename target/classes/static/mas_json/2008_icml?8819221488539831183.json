Here, we integrate several concepts and obtain a fast and simple algorithm. We show that the proposed algorithm finds a near-optimal policy in polynomial time, and give experimental evidence that it is robust and efficient compared to its ascendants.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University", "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Istvan Szita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szita:Istvan", "Andr\u00e1s L\u00f6rincz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=ouml=rincz:Andr=aacute=s"], "pages": 8}
