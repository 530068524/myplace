{"title": "Automatic generation of load tests.", "fields": ["load testing", "test compression", "test management approach", "test harness", "test suite"], "abstract": "Load tests aim to validate whether system performance is acceptable under peak conditions. Existing test generation techniques induce load by increasing the size or rate of the input. Ignoring the particular input values, however, may lead to test suites that grossly mischaracterize a system's performance. To address this limitation we introduce a mixed symbolic execution based approach that is unique in how it 1) favors program paths associated with a performance measure of interest, 2) operates in an iterative-deepening beam-search fashion to discard paths that are unlikely to lead to high-load tests, and 3) generates a test suite of a given size and level of diversity. An assessment of the approach shows it generates test suites that induce program response times and memory consumption several times worse than the compared alternatives, it scales to large and complex inputs, and it exposes a diversity of resource consuming program behavior.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln"], "authors": ["Pingyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Pingyu", "Sebastian G.
