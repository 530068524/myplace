In a pair of experiments, Writers receive feedback about a document from Critics over instant messaging (IM) or videoconferencing. The results suggest that when Writers cannot see and hear the Critic, they interpret feedback to be more negative and less credible, and are less likely to incorporate suggested changes.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Matthew J.
