In this work we go beyond the state of the art by studying search target prediction in an open-world setting in which we no longer assume that we have fixation data to train for the search targets. We present a dataset containing fixation data of 18 users searching for natural images from three image categories within synthesised image collages of about 80 images. In a closed-world baseline experiment we show that we can predict the correct target image out of a candidate set of five images. We then present a new problem formulation for search target prediction in the open-world setting that is based on learning compatibilities between fixations and potential targets.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hosnieh Sattar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sattar:Hosnieh", "Sabine M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Sabine", "Mario Fritz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fritz:Mario", "Andreas Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Andreas"], "pages": 10}
