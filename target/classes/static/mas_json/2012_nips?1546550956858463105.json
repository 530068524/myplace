{"title": "Learning with Partially Absorbing Random Walks.", "fields": ["random graph", "conductance", "random walk", "stochastic process", "graph"], "abstract": "We propose a novel stochastic process that is with probability \u03b1i being absorbed at current state i, and with probability 1 \u2013 \u03b1i follows a random edge out of it. We analyze its properties and show its potential for exploring graph structures. We prove that under proper absorption rates, a random walk starting from a set S of low conductance will be mostly absorbed in S. Moreover, the absorption probabilities vary slowly inside S, while dropping sharply outside, thus implementing the desirable cluster assumption for graph-based learning. Remarkably, the partially absorbing process unifies many popular models arising in a variety of contexts, provides new insights into them, and makes it possible for transferring findings from one paradigm to another. Simulation results demonstrate its promising applications in retrieval and classification.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Xiao-Ming Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xiao=Ming", "Zhenguo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhenguo", "Anthony Man-Cho So.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/So:Anthony_Man=Cho", "John Wright.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wright:John", "Shih-Fu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Shih=Fu"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
