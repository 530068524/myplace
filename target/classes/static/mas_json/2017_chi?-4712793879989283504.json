This information is delivered through a combination of voice- and web-based feedback that is derived from data already collected by CHWs. We describe the in situ participatory design approach used to create usable and appropriate feedback for low-literate CHWs and present usage data from a 12-month study with 71 CHWs in India. We show how the system supported and motivated CHWs, and how they used  both  the web- and voice-based systems, and each of the visualizations, for different reasons. We also show that the comparative feedback provided by the system introduced elements of competition that discouraged some CHWs while motivating others. Taken together, our findings suggest that providing personalized voice- and web-based feedback could be an effective way to support and motivate CHWs in low-resource settings.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Cape Town", "Cornell University", "Dimagi", "Harvard University", "Dimagi"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Brian DeRenzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeRenzi:Brian", "Nicola Dell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dell:Nicola", "Jeremy Wacksman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wacksman:Jeremy", "Scott Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Scott", "Neal Lesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lesh:Neal"], "pages": 12}
