{"title": "Understanding and Discovering Deliberate Self-harm Content in Social Media.", "fields": ["social media mining", "social media", "harm", "user modeling", "mental health"], "abstract": "Studies suggest that self-harm users found it easier to discuss self-harm-related thoughts and behaviors using social media than in the physical world. Given the enormous and increasing volume of social media data, on-line self-harm content is likely to be buried rapidly by other normal content. To enable voices of self-harm users to be heard, it is important to distinguish self-harm content from other types of content. In this paper, we aim to understand self-harm content and provide automatic approaches to its detection. We first perform a comprehensive analysis on self-harm social media using different input cues. Our analysis, the first of its kind in large scale, reveals a number of important findings. Then we propose frameworks that incorporate the findings to discover self-harm content under both supervised and unsupervised settings. Our experimental results on a large social media dataset from Flickr demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks and the importance of our findings in discovering self-harm content.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Michigan State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Yilin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yilin", "Jiliang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jiliang", "Jundong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jundong", "Baoxin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baoxin", "Yali Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Yali", "Clayton Mellina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mellina:Clayton", "Neil O'Hare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Hare:Neil", "Yi Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yi"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
