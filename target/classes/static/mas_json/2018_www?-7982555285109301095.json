{"title": "Weakly-supervised Relation Extraction by Pattern-enhanced Embedding Learning.", "fields": ["text corpus", "unified model", "embedding", "relationship extraction", "co training"], "abstract": "Extracting relations from text corpora is an important task with wide applications. However, it becomes particularly challenging when focusing on weakly-supervised relation extraction, that is, utilizing a few relation instances (i.e., a pair of entities and their relation) as seeds to extract from corpora more instances of the same relation. Existing distributional approaches leverage the corpus-level co-occurrence statistics of entities to predict their relations, and require large amount of labeled instances to learn effective relation classifiers. Alternatively, pattern-based approaches perform boostrapping or apply neural networks to model the local contexts, but still rely on large amount of labeled instances to build reliable models. In this paper, we study the integration of distributional and pattern-based methods in a weakly-supervised setting such that the two kinds of methods can provide complementary supervision for each other to build an effective, unified model. We propose a novel framework with a distributional module and a pattern module. During training, the distributional module helps the pattern module discriminate between the informative patterns and other patterns, and the pattern module generates some highly-confident instances to improve the distributional module. The whole framework can be effectively optimized by iterating between improving the pattern module and updating the distributional module. We conduct experiments on two tasks: knowledge base completion and corpus-level relation extraction. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our framework over many competitive baselines.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Meng Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Meng", "Xiang Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Xiang", "Yu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yu", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
