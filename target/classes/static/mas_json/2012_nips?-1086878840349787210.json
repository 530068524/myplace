We show that any distribution     on the set     of binary vectors of length     can be arbitrarily well approximated by an RBM with     hidden units, where     is the minimal number of pairs of binary vectors differing in only one entry such that their union contains the support set of    . In important cases this number is half the cardinality of the support set of     given in Le Roux & Bengio, 2008. We construct a DBN with    , hidden layers of width     that is capable of approximating any distribution on     arbitrarily well. This confirms a conjecture presented in Le Roux and Bengio 2010.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Max Planck Society", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Baidu", "University of Paris", "University of Paris"], "authors": ["Kevin Swersky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swersky:Kevin", "Daniel Tarlow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarlow:Daniel", "Ilya Sutskever.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sutskever:Ilya", "Ruslan Salakhutdinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salakhutdinov:Ruslan", "Richard S.
