{"title": "Learning Sparse Combinatorial Representations via Two-stage Submodular Maximization.", "fields": ["submodular set function", "cardinality", "feature learning", "maximum coverage problem", "continuous optimization"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning sparse representations of data sets, where the goal is to reduce a data set in manner that optimizes multiple objectives. Motivated by applications of data summarization, we develop a new model which we refer to as the two-stage submodular maximization problem. This task can be viewed as a combinatorial analogue of representation learning problems such as dictionary learning and sparse regression. The two-stage problem strictly generalizes the problem of cardinality constrained submodular maximization, though the objective function is not submodular and the techniques for submodular maximization cannot be applied. We describe a continuous optimization method which achieves an approximation ratio which asymptotically approaches 1 - 1/e. For instances where the asymptotics do not kick in, we design a local-search algorithm whose approximation ratio is arbitrarily close to 1/2. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on two multi-objective data summarization tasks, where the goal is to construct summaries via sparse representative subsets w.r.t. to predefined objectives.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Harvard University", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Harvard University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Eric Balkanski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balkanski:Eric", "Baharan Mirzasoleiman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mirzasoleiman:Baharan", "Andreas Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause_0001:Andreas", "Yaron Singer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singer:Yaron"], "pages": 10}
