We designed a multimodal sensor set-up for continuous logging of audio, visual, physiological and contextual data, a classification scheme for predicting user affective state and an interface for user reflection. The system continuously predicts a user's valence, arousal and engage-ment, and correlates this with information on events, communications and data interactions. We evaluate the interface through a user study consisting of six users and over 240 hours of data, and demonstrate the utility of such a reflection tool. We show that users could reason forward and backward in time about their emotional experiences using the interface, and found this useful.", "citation": "Citations (171)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Daniel McDuff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McDuff:Daniel", "Amy K.
