However, how daily activities are correlated to people's happiness (such as their satisfaction from work and social lives) is not well explored. In this work, we propose an approach to investigate the relationship between users' daily activity patterns and their life satisfaction level. From a well-known longitudinal dataset collected by mobile devices, we extract various activity features through location and proximity information, and compute the entropies of these data to capture the regularities of the behavioral patterns of the participants. We then perform component analysis and structural equation modeling to identify key behavior contributors to self-reported satisfaction scores. Our results show that our analytical procedure can identify meaningful assumptions of causality between activities and satisfaction. Particularly, keeping regularity in daily activities can significantly improve the life satisfaction.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Swiss Federal I ... ne, Switzerland"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Onur Y\u00fcr\u00fcten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Y=uuml=r=uuml=ten:Onur", "Jiyong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jiyong", "Pearl Huan Z.
