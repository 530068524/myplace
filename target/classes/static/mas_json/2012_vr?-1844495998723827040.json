In this paper we propose a reinforcement learning framework to extract suitable interaction for each person from daily behavior. In the experiment, we show the feasibility of the proposed methodology.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Kwansei Gakuin University"], "authors": ["Junya Nakase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakase:Junya", "Koichi Moriyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moriyama:Koichi", "Kiyoshi Kiyokawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiyokawa:Kiyoshi", "Masayuki Numao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Numao:Masayuki", "Mayumi Oyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oyama:Mayumi", "Satoshi Kurihara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurihara:Satoshi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
