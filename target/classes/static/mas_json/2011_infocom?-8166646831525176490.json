Scheduling algorithms have been developed in a number of different models that ensure network stability as long as no queue is inherently overloaded. However, this literature typically assumes that each server runs at a fixed maximum speed. Although this is optimal for clearing queue backlogs as fast as possible, it may be suboptimal in terms of energy consumption. Indeed, a lightly loaded server could operate at a lower rate, at least temporarily, to save energy.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Matthew Andrews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andrews:Matthew", "Spyridon Antonakopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antonakopoulos:Spyridon", "Lisa Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lisa"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
