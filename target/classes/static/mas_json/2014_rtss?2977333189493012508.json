A clairvoyant scheduler. We demonstrate the flexibility and power of our approach by comparing the competitive ratio of several on-line algorithms, including Dover, that have been proposed in the past, for various task sets. Our experimental results reveal that none of these algorithms is universally optimal, in the sense that there are task sets where other schedulers provide better performance. Our framework is hence a very useful design tool for selecting optimal algorithms for a given application.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Andreas Pavlogiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pavlogiannis:Andreas", "Alexander K\u00f6\u00dfler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml==szlig=ler:Alexander", "Ulrich Schmid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmid_0001:Ulrich"], "pages": 10}
