They provide elegant solutions in various application scenarios, e.g. for private function evaluationi\u00be?PFE and for improving the flexibility of attribute-based encryptioni\u00be?ABE schemes. The optimal size of a universal circuit is proven to be $$\\varOmega k\\log k$$ \u03a9klogk. Valianti\u00be?STOC'76 proposed a size-optimized UC construction, which has not been put in practice ever since. The only implementation of universal circuits was provided by Kolesnikov and Schneider FC'08, with sizei\u00be? $$\\mathcal {O}k\\log ^2 k$$ Oklog2k.\n\nIn this paper, we refine the size of Valiant's UC and further improve the construction by at least 2k. We show that due to recent optimizations and our improvements, it is the best solution to apply in the case for circuits with a constant number of inputs and outputs. When the number of inputs or outputs is linear in the number of gates, we propose a more efficient hybrid solution based on the two existing constructions. We validate the practicality of Valiant's UC, by giving an example implementation for PFE using these size-optimized UCs.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["\u00c1gnes Kiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiss:=Aacute=gnes", "Thomas Schneider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schneider_0003:Thomas"], "pages": 30}
