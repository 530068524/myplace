Concretely, we use the formalism and terminology of classical projective geometry to model cameras by two-parameter linear families of straight lines-that is, degenerate reguli (rank-3 families) and non-degenerate linear congruences (rank-4 families). This model captures both the general linear cameras of Yu and McMillan and the linear oblique cameras of Pajdla. From a geometric perspective, it affords a simple classification of all possible camera configurations. From an analytical viewpoint, it also provides a simple and unified methodology for deriving general formulas for projection and inverse projection, triangulation, and binocular and trinocular geometry.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jean Ponce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponce:Jean"], "pages": 8}
