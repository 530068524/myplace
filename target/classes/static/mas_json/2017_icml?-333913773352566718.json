For centralized (i.e. master/slave) algorithms, we show that distributing Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent is optimal and achieves a precision $\\varepsilon > 0$ in time $O(\\sqrt{\\kappa_g}(1+\\Delta\\tau)\\ln(1/\\varepsilon))$, where $\\kappa_g$ is the condition number of the (global) function to optimize, $\\Delta$ is the diameter of the network, and $\\tau$ (resp. $1$) is the time needed to communicate values between two neighbors (resp. perform local computations). For decentralized algorithms based on gossip, we provide the first optimal algorithm, called the multi-step dual accelerated (MSDA) method, that achieves a precision $\\varepsilon > 0$ in time $O(\\sqrt{\\kappa_l}(1+\\frac{\\tau}{\\sqrt{\\gamma}})\\ln(1/\\varepsilon))$, where $\\kappa_l$ is the condition number of the local functions and $\\gamma$ is the (normalized) eigengap of the gossip matrix used for communication between nodes. We then verify the efficiency of MSDA against state-of-the-art methods for two problems: least-squares regression and classification by logistic regression.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "SIERRA"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Kevin Scaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scaman:Kevin", "Francis R.
