This seems to be a great waste of human efforts, and it would be nice to automatically adapt one annotation standard to another. We present a simple yet effective strategy that transfers knowledge from a differently annotated corpus to the corpus with desired annotation. We test the efficacy of this method in the context of Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging, where no segmentation and POS tagging standards are widely accepted due to the lack of morphology in Chinese. Experiments show that adaptation from the much larger People's Daily corpus to the smaller but more popular Penn Chinese Treebank results in significant improvements in both segmentation and tagging accuracies (with error reductions of 30.2% and 14%, respectively), which in turn helps improve Chinese parsing accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Google", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Je Hun Jeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeon:Je_Hun", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0004:Yang"], "pages": 9}
