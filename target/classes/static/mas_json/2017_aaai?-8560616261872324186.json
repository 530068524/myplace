Tracking multiple objects in real-world scenes involves many challenges, including a) an a-priori unknown and time-varying number of targets, b) a continuous state estimation of all present targets, and c) a discrete combinatorial problem of data association. Most previous methods involve complex models that require tedious tuning of parameters. Here, we propose for the first time, an end-to-end learning approach for online multi-target tracking. Existing deep learning methods are not designed for the above challenges and cannot be trivially applied to the task. Our solution addresses all of the above points in a principled way. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show promising results obtained at ~300 Hz on a standard CPU, and pave the way towards future research in this direction.", "citation": "Citations (101)", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "ETH Zurich", "University of Adelaide"], "authors": ["Anton Milan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milan:Anton", "Seyed Hamid Rezatofighi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rezatofighi:Seyed_Hamid", "Anthony R.
