Researchers are now beginning to use recent advances in machine learning in software optimizations, augmenting or replacing traditional heuristics and data structures. However, the space of machine learning for computer hardware architecture is only lightly explored. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of deep learning to address the von Neumann bottleneck of memory performance. We focus on the critical problem of learning memory access patterns, with the goal of constructing accurate and efficient memory prefetchers. We relate contemporary prefetching strategies to n-gram models in natural language processing, and show how recurrent neural networks can serve as a drop-in replacement. On a suite of challenging benchmark datasets, we find that neural networks consistently demonstrate superior performance in terms of precision and recall. This work represents the first step towards practical neural-network based prefetching, and opens a wide range of exciting directions for machine learning in computer architecture research.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Stanford University", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Milad Hashemi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hashemi:Milad", "Kevin Swersky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swersky:Kevin", "Jamie A.
