{"title": "On the Strictness of the First-Order Quantifier Structure Hierarchy over Finite Structures.", "fields": ["datalog", "expressivity", "quantifier elimination", "finite model theory", "expressive power"], "abstract": "One of the major interests of finite model theory is to separate the expressive power of different logics or fragments of logics. In this paper, we define a variant of Ehrenfeucht-Fra\\\"iss\\' e games that characterizes quantifier classes over finite structures and prove that the fragments of first-order logic based on quantifier structures form a strict hierarchy in terms of their expressiveness over finite structures.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Yuguo He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yuguo"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
