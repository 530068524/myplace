We offer postcolonial computing as an analytical orientation to better understand these challenges. This analytic orientation inspires four key shifts in our approach to HCI4D efforts: generative models of culture, development as a historical program, uneven economic relations, and cultural epistemologies. Then, through reconsideration of the practices of engagement, articulation and translation in other contexts, we offer designers and researchers ways of understanding use and design practice to respond to global connectivity and movement.", "citation": "Citations (301)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Lilly Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Lilly", "Janet Vertesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vertesi:Janet", "Paul Dourish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dourish:Paul", "Kavita Philip.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Philip:Kavita", "Rebecca E.
