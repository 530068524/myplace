{"title": "Civic action brokering platforms: facilitating local engagement with ACTion Alexandria.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "social media", "general partnership", "computer science", "civic engagement"], "abstract": "Local communities are turning to new online systems to help motivate and coordinate local volunteerism and problem solving. Inspired by the American barn raising tradition, ACTion Alexandria is designed to help local residents and service-oriented organizations collectively take action to address pressing local needs. This paper introduces \"civic action brokering\" as a new theoretical concept and frames it within a year-long evaluation of ACTion Alexandria. A mixed-method, case study approach was used to understand how social practices, roles, and technologies helped or hindered successful action brokering. Successes were attributed to a competent community manager, institutional support from an existing nonprofit brokering agency, effective use of social media, a synergistic partnership with nonprofits that helped grow each group's donor network, and emphasis on promoting immediate actions and soliciting ideas for Community Challenges among residents and nonprofit organizations.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Brigham Young University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Brookings Institution"], "authors": ["Derek L.
