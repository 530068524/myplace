We propose a deep learning approach to predicting the probabilistic distribution of motion blur at the patch level using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We further extend the candidate set of motion kernels predicted by the CNN using carefully designed image rotations. A Markov random field model is then used to infer a dense non-uniform motion blur field enforcing motion smoothness. Finally, motion blur is removed by a non-uniform deblurring model using patch-level image prior. Experimental evaluations show that our approach can effectively estimate and remove complex non-uniform motion blur that is not handled well by previous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (133)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0009:Jian", "Wenfei Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Wenfei", "Zongben Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zongben", "Jean Ponce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponce:Jean"], "pages": 9}
