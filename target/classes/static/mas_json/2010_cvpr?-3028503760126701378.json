In particular, a subset of features is selected such that the distance computed using these features satisfies the given pairwise constraints. An efficient online feature selection algorithm is presented based on the dual-gradient descent approach. Side information in the form of pair-wise constraints is incorporated into the feature selection stage, providing the user with flexibility to use an unsupervised or semi-supervised algorithm at a later stage. Correlated subsets of visual words, usually resulting from hierarchical quantization process (called groups), are exploited to select a significantly smaller vocabulary. A group-LASSO regularizer is used to drive as many feature weights to zero as possible. We evaluate the quality of the pruned vocabulary by clustering the data using the resulting feature subset. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset using 5000 visual keywords, resulted in around 80% reduction in the number of keywords, with little or no loss in performance.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Dept.
