Dialogue generation is about generating utterance given previous utterances as contexts. Among di?erent spectrums of dialogue generation approaches, end-to-end neural generation models surge in recent researches. Unlike other methods, those end-to-end neural generation models are capable of generating natural sounding sentences with a unifed neural network encoder-decoder structure. The end-to-end structure sequentially encodes each word in an input context and generate the response word-by-word deterministically when decoding. However, the lack of variation and the limited ability in capturing long-term dependencies between utterances still make the dialogue generation a challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network encoder-decoder based model\u2014the hierarchical variational memory network (HVMN), to take advantage of both the hierarchical structure and the variational memory network, which not only emulates human-to-human dialogues, but also latently captures the high-level abstract variations and long-term memories during dialogue tracking. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets in English and Chinese, and an e-commerce customer service dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed method. Moreover, we fnd that HVMN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in all three datasets signifcantly", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "JD.com, Beijing, China", "JD.com, Beijing, China", "JD.com, Beijing, CA, China", "JD.com, Beijing, China"], "authors": ["Hongshen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hongshen", "Zhaochun Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Zhaochun", "Jiliang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jiliang", "Yihong Eric Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yihong_Eric", "Dawei Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Dawei"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
