{"title": "Fractured 3D object restoration and completion.", "fields": ["ray tracing", "computer vision", "bibliography", "computer science", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "The problem of object restoration from eroded fragments where large parts could be missing is of high relevance in archaeology. Manual restoration is possible and common in practice but it is a tedious and error-prone process, which does not scale well. Solutions for specific parts of the problem have been proposed but a complete reassembly and repair pipeline is absent from the bibliography. We propose a shape restoration pipeline consisting of appropriate methods for automatic fragment reassembly and shape completion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real-world fractured objects.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Athens University of Economics and Business", "University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "Athens University of Economics and Business", "Athens University of Economics and Business"], "authors": ["Anthousis Andreadis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andreadis:Anthousis", "Robert Gregor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gregor:Robert", "Ivan Sipiran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sipiran:Ivan", "Pavlos Mavridis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mavridis:Pavlos", "Georgios Papaioannou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papaioannou:Georgios", "Tobias Schreck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schreck:Tobias"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
