{"title": "Cooperative packet recovery in enterprise WLANs.", "fields": ["network packet", "universal software radio peripheral", "symbol", "exploit", "testbed"], "abstract": "Cooperative packet recovery has been widely investigated in wireless networks, where corrupt copies of a packet are combined to recover the original packet. While previous work such as MRD (Multi Radio Diversity) and Soft apply combining to bits and bit-confidences, combining at the symbol level has been avoided. The reason is rooted in the prohibitive overhead of sharing raw symbol information between different APs of an enterprise WLAN. We present Epicenter that overcomes this constraint, and combines multiple copies of incorrectly received \u201csymbols\u201d to infer the actual transmitted symbol. Our core finding is that symbols need not be represented in full fidelity - coarse representation of symbols can preserve most of their diversity, while substantially lowering the overhead. We then develop a rate estimation algorithm that actually exploits symbol level combining. Our USRP/GNURadio testbed confirms the viability of our ideas, yielding 40% throughput gain over Soft, and 25-90% over 802.11. While the gains are modest, we believe that they are realistic, and available with minimal modifications to today's EWLAN systems.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Hewlett-Packard", "Duke University", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Mahanth Gowda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gowda:Mahanth", "Souvik Sen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sen:Souvik", "Romit Roy Choudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhury:Romit_Roy", "Sung-Ju Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sung=Ju"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
