No previous work has considered the higher performance, but more complex, warp-specialized kernels based on producer-consumer named barriers available on current hardware. In this work we present the first formal operational semantics for named barriers and define what it means for a warp-specialized kernel to be correct. We give algorithms for verifying the correctness of warp-specialized kernels and prove that they are both sound and complete for the most common class of warp-specialized programs. We also present WEFT, a verification tool for checking warp-specialized code. Using WEFT, we discover several non-trivial bugs in production warp-specialized kernels.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Nvidia", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Rahul Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma_0001:Rahul", "Michael Bauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauer:Michael", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
