Given the well-understood limitations of radio frequency (RF) propagation in the human body, in our previous work we investigated the use of ultrasonic waves as an alternative physical carrier of information (1), and proposed Ultrasonic WideBand (UsWB), an ultrasonic multipath-resilient integrated physical and medium access control (MAC) layer protocol (2). In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a software-defined testbed architecture for ultrasonic intra-body area networks, and propose the first experimental demonstration of the feasibility of ultrasonic communications in biological tissues. We first discuss in detail our FPGA-based prototype implementation of UsWB. We then demonstrate how the prototype can flexibly trade performance off for power consumption, and achieve, for bit error rates (BER) no higher than 10 6 , either (i) high-data rate transmissions up to 700 kbit=s at a transmit power of -14 dBm ( 40 W), or (ii) low-data rate and lower-power transmissions down to -21dBm ( 8 W) at 70kbit=s. Finally, we show how the UsWB MAC protocol allows multiple transmitter-receiver pairs to coexist and dynamically adapt the transmission rate according to channel and interference conditions to maximize throughput while satisfying predefined reliability constraints.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Giuseppe Enrico Santagati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santagati:Giuseppe_Enrico", "Tommaso Melodia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melodia:Tommaso"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
