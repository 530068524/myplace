Despite their wide-spread adoption by industry, a formal definition of elasticity and suitable procedures for its assessment and verification are still missing. Both academia and industry are trying to adapt established testing procedures for functional and non-functional properties, with limited effectiveness with respect to elasticity. In this paper we propose a new methodology to automatically generate test-suites for testing the elastic properties of systems. Elasticity, plasticity, and oscillations are first formalized through a convenient behavioral abstraction of the elastic system and then used to drive an iterative test suite refinement process. The outcomes of our approach are a test suite tailored to the violation of elasticity properties and a human-readable abstraction of the system behavior to further support diagnosis and fix.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Stuttgart", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Alessio Gambi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gambi:Alessio", "Antonio Filieri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filieri:Antonio", "Schahram Dustdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dustdar:Schahram"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
