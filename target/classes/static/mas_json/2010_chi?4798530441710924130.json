This web-based tool was developed through a year-long participatory design process with five small businesses in Scotland and in New England. Sourcemap was used as a diagnostic tool for carbon accounting, design and supply chain management. It offers a number of ways to market sustainable practices through embedded and printed visualizations. Our experiences confirm the potential of web sustainability tools and social media to expand the discourse and to negotiate the diverse goals inherent in social and environmental sustainability.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Avencia Inc., C ... bridge, MA, USA"], "authors": ["Leonardo Bonanni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonanni:Leonardo", "Matthew Hockenberry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hockenberry:Matthew", "David Zwarg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zwarg:David", "Chris Csikszentmih\u00e1lyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Csikszentmih=aacute=lyi:Chris", "Hiroshi Ishii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishii_0001:Hiroshi"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
