Unfortunately, the use of these processors may introduce suspension delays incurred by communication, synchronization and external I/O operations. When these processors are used in real-time systems, conventional schedulability analyses incorporate these delays in the worst-case execution/response time, hence significantly reducing the schedulable utilization. In this paper, we provide schedulability analyses and propose segment-fixed priority scheduling for self-suspending tasks. We model the tasks as segments of execution separated by suspensions. We start from providing response-time analyses for self-suspending tasks under Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS). While RMS is shown to not be optimal, it can be used effectively in some special cases that we have identified. We then derive a utilization bound for the cases as a function of the ratio of the suspension duration to the period of the tasks. For general cases, we develop a segment-fixed priority scheduling scheme. Our scheme assigns individual segments different priorities and phase offsets that are used for phase enforcement to control the unexpected self-suspending nature. With the exact schedulability analysis designed for our scheme, our experiments show that the proposed scheme provides up to 40 times more schedulable utilization than RMS.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Software Engineering Institute", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Junsung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Junsung", "Bj\u00f6rn Andersson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andersson:Bj=ouml=rn", "Dionisio de Niz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niz:Dionisio_de", "Ragunathan Rajkumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajkumar:Ragunathan"], "pages": 12}
