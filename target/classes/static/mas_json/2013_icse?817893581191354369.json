However, typical text comments can easily become verbose or evasive. Thus sometimes code reviewers find an audio or video code narration quite helpful. In this paper, we present our tool, called MCT (Multimedia Commenting Tool), which is an integrated development environment-based tool that enables programmers to easily explain their code by voice, video and mouse movement in the form of comments. With this tool, programmers can replay the audio or video when they feel like.
