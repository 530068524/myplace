Unlike traditional VLC, no specifically designed light emitter and receiver are required. In the proposed system, light projector is used as the information source and digital cameras act as information decoder. The emitted light is designed in a specific way such that it can carry meaningful information (or simply works as an illumination source) for human eyes while other message can be decoded by the digital camera due to the fundamental difference in the imaging mechanism of the human eye and digital devices. We further describe two applications of this new type of VLC in ubiquitous augmented reality and illegal camcorder-recording prevention with extensive experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Chunjia Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Chunjia", "Guangtao Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Guangtao", "Zhongpai Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Zhongpai"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
