Modern automated lexicon generation methods usually require parallel corpora, which are not available for most language pairs. Lexicons can be generated using non-parallel corpora or a pivot language, but such lexicons are noisy. We present an algorithm for generating a high quality lexicon from a noisy one, which only requires an independent corpus for each language. Our algorithm introduces non-aligned signatures (NAS), a cross-lingual word context similarity score that avoids the over-constrained and inefficient nature of alignment-based methods. We use NAS to eliminate incorrect translations from the generated lexicon. We evaluate our method by improving the quality of noisy Spanish-Hebrew lexicons generated from two pivot English lexicons. Our algorithm substantially outperforms other lexicon generation methods.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Daphna Shezaf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shezaf:Daphna", "Ari Rappoport.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rappoport:Ari"], "pages": 10}
