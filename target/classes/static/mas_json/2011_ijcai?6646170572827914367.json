{"title": "Relating Carneades with Abstract Argumentation.", "fields": ["graph", "argumentation theory", "formalism", "algorithm", "semantics"], "abstract": "Carneades is a recently proposed formalism for structured argumentation with varying proof standards. An open question is its relation with Dung's seminal abstract approach to argumentation. In this paper the two formalisms are formally related by translating Carneades into ASPIC+, another recently proposed formalism for structured argumentation. Since ASPIC+ is defined to generate Dungstyle abstract argumentation frameworks, this in effect translates Carneades graphs into abstract argumentation frameworks. It is proven that Carneades always induces a unique Dung extension, which is the same in all of Dung's semantics.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Utrecht University", "University of Groningen"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Bas van Gijzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gijzel:Bas_van", "Henry Prakken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prakken:Henry"], "pages": 7}
