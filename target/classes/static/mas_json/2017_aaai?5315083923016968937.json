We further extend the equivalence to multiple factor matrices and show that all the factor norms can be convex and smooth for any  p  > 0. In contrast, the original Schatten- p  norm for  0 <  p  < 1 is non-convex and non-smooth. As an example we conduct experiments on matrix completion. To utilize the convexity of the factor matrix norms, we adopt the accelerated proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm and establish its sequence convergence. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets exhibit its superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods. Its speed is also highly competitive.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Chen Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Chen", "Zhouchen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhouchen", "Hongbin Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongbin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
