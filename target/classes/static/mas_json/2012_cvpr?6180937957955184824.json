Unlike most previous methods, our detection algorithm accumulates pixel-level correspondence in translation space. Thus it does not rely on feature point detection and handles patterns with low repetition counts. To improve the robustness with multiple interfering symmetries, we introduce an image-space global optimization, which resolves multiple per-pixel symmetry lattices. We then propose a learning-based method that generates refined segmentation of foreground symmetry objects of arbitrary shapes, with the aid of the per-pixel symmetry information. Our proposed method is accurate, robust and efficient as demonstrated by an extensive evaluation using a large facade image database.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Peng Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Peng", "Lei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Lei", "Honghui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Honghui", "Long Quan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quan:Long"], "pages": 8}
