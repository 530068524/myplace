Importantly, these proofs of work have to be hard enough so that miners have an opportunity to unify their views in the presence of an adversary who interferes but has bounded computational power, but easy enough to be solvable regularly and enable the miners to make progress. As such, as the miners\u2019 population evolves over time, so should the difficulty of these proofs. Bitcoin provides this adjustment mechanism, with empirical evidence of a constant block generation rate against such population changes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "University of Edinburgh", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"], "authors": ["Juan A.
