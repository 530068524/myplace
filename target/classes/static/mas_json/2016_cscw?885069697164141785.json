New platforms for scholarly communication enhance informal communication and imbue it with some of the functionalities of formal communication. A citation analysis was conducted to examine how content from one of these platforms, MathOverflow, has been cited and referenced within the mathematics literature. Citation patterns suggested that some authors were treating MathOverflow content as a legitimate source of scholarly knowledge. Some problems with references and attribution occurred, which can be addressed by changes in the design of these technologies. Developing better systems for scholarly communication can help advance open science.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Yla R.
