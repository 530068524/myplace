{"title": "Bubble rupture simulation by considering high density ratio.", "fields": ["bubble", "rendering", "density ratio", "water cooler", "eulerian path"], "abstract": "[Hong et al. 2008] proposed a hybrid method of Eulerian grids and Lagrangian particles to represent small-scale bubbles in large-scale water. In the simulation, bubbles rise freely in the water; however, bubble seeds are set at random at the bottom and they disappear as soon as they arrive at the water surface. [Patkar et al. 2013] also proposed a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian framework to visualize both small and large scale bubbles. A bubble that exits the spout of a water dispenser flows up in the water with changing its shape; however, they did not simulate the rupture process of bubble. Then, [Mukai et al. 2012] tried a rupture simulation by using MPS method; however, it did not consider the high density ratio of the water to the air so that the bubble ruptured gradually. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of bubble rupture simulation, where a wave is generated after a bubble has ruptured rapidly, by considering the high density ratio of the water to the air.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tokyo City University", "Tokyo City University", "Tokyo City University"], "authors": ["Nobuhiko Mukai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukai:Nobuhiko", "Naoki Mita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mita:Naoki", "Youngha Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Youngha"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
