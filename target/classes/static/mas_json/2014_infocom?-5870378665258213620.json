However, current literature achieves the throughput optimality with an exponential delay scaling with the network size, even in a simplified scenario for transmission jobs with uniform sizes. Although CSMA protocols with order-optimal average delay have been proposed for specific topologies, no existing work can provide worst-case delay guarantee for each job in general network settings, not to mention the case when the jobs have non-uniform lengths while the throughput optimality is still targeted. In this paper, we tackle on this issue by proposing a two-timescale CSMA-based data communication protocol with dynamic decisions on rate control, link scheduling, job transmis- sion and dropping in polynomial complexity. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed protocol can achieve a throughput utility arbitrarily close to its offline optima for jobs with non-uniform sizes and worst-case delay guarantees, with a tradeoff of longer maximum allowable delay.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Hongxing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongxing", "Nitin Vaidya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaidya:Nitin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
