{"title": "Collaborative Access Control in WebdamLog.", "fields": ["datalog", "computer access control", "personal information management", "role based access control", "data access"], "abstract": "The management of Web users' personal information is increasingly distributed across a broad array of applications and systems, including online social networks and cloud-based services. Users wish to share data using these systems, but avoiding the risks of unintended disclosures or unauthorized access by applications has become a major challenge.   We propose a novel access control model that operates within a distributed data management framework based on datalog. Using this model, users can control access to data they own and control applications they run. They can conveniently specify access control policies providing flexible tuple-level control derived using provenance information. We present a formal specification of the model, an implementation built using an open-source distributed datalog engine, and an extensive experimental evaluation showing that the computational cost of access control is modest.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Vera Zaychik Moffitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moffitt:Vera_Zaychik", "Julia Stoyanovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoyanovich:Julia", "Serge Abiteboul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abiteboul:Serge", "Gerome Miklau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miklau:Gerome"], "pages": 15}
