These algorithms are in general the most efficient for real-world applications. Existing data indicates that, among MaxSAT algorithms based on iterative SAT solving, the most efficient ones are core-guided, i.e. algorithms which guide the search by iteratively computing unsatisfiable subformulas (or cores). For weighted MaxSAT, core-guided algorithms exhibit a number of important drawbacks, including a possibly exponential number of iterations and the use of a large number of auxiliary variables. This paper develops two new algorithms for (weighted) MaxSAT that address these two drawbacks. The first MaxSAT algorithm implements core-guided iterative SAT solving with binary search. The second algorithm extends the first one by exploiting disjoint cores. The empirical evaluation shows that core-guided binary search is competitive with current MaxSAT solvers.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["University College Dublin", "University College Dublin", "University College Dublin"], "authors": ["Federico Heras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heras:Federico", "Ant\u00f3nio Morgado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morgado:Ant=oacute=nio", "Jo\u00e3o Marques-Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marques=Silva:Jo=atilde=o"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
