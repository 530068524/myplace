The formula has a number of theoretical implications on LBP. It is applied to give a sufficient condition that the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is positive definite, which shows non-convexity for graphs with multiple cycles. The formula clarifies the relation between the local stability of a fixed point of LBP and local minima of the Bethe free energy. We also propose a new approach to the uniqueness of LBP fixed point, and show various conditions of uniqueness.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["The Institute o ... , Tokyo, Japan", "The Institute o ... , Tokyo, Japan"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yusuke Watanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watanabe:Yusuke", "Kenji Fukumizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukumizu:Kenji"], "pages": 9}
