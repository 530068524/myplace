Workflows in Panda are arbitrary a cyclic graphs containing both relational (SQL) processing nodes and opaque processing nodes programmed in Python. For both types of nodes, Panda generates logical provenance -- provenance information stored at the processing-node level -- and uses the generated provenance to support record-level backward tracing and forward tracing operations. In our demonstration we use Panda to integrate, process, and analyze actual education data from multiple sources. We specifically demonstrate how Panda's provenance generation and tracing capabilities can be very useful for workflow debugging, and for drilling down on specific results of interest.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Robert Ikeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikeda:Robert", "Junsang Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Junsang", "Charlie Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Charlie", "Semih Salihoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salihoglu:Semih", "Satoshi Torikai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torikai:Satoshi", "Jennifer Widom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Widom:Jennifer"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
