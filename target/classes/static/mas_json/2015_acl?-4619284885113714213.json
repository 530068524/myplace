{"title": "It Depends: Dependency Parser Comparison Using A Web-based Evaluation Tool.", "fields": ["parsing", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing", "dependency grammar", "web application"], "abstract": "The last few years have seen a surge in the number of accurate, fast, publicly available dependency parsers. At the same time, the use of dependency parsing in NLP applications has increased. It can be difficult for a non-expert to select a good \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d parser. We present a comparative analysis of ten leading statistical dependency parsers on a multi-genre corpus of English. For our analysis, we developed a new web-based tool that gives a convenient way of comparing dependency parser outputs. Our analysis will help practitioners choose a parser to optimize their desired speed/accuracy tradeoff, and our tool will help practitioners examine and compare parser output.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Emory University", "Princeton University", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jinho D.
