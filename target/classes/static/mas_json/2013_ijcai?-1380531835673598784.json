In this paper, by introducing hybrid tree as a latent structure variable to close the gap between the input sentences and output representations, we formulate semantic parsing as a structured prediction problem, based on the latent variable perceptron model incorporated with a tree edit-distance loss as optimization criterion. The proposed approach maintains the advantage of a discriminative model in accommodating flexible combination of features and naturally incorporates an efficient decoding algorithm in learning and inference. Furthermore, in order to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of inference, we design an effective approach based on vector space model to extract a smaller subset of relevant MR productions for test examples. Experimental results on publicly available corpus show that our approach significantly outperforms previous systems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Nanjing Normal University", "Nanjing Normal University", "Nanjing Normal University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Junsheng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Junsheng", "Juhong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Juhong", "Weiguang Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Weiguang"], "pages": 8}
