{"title": "Rapier: Integrating routing and scheduling for coflow-aware data center networks.", "fields": ["spark", "testbed", "two level scheduling", "fair share scheduling", "dynamic priority scheduling"], "abstract": "In the data flow models of today's data center applications such as MapReduce, Spark and Dryad, multiple flows can comprise a coflow group semantically. Only completing all flows in a coflow is meaningful to an application. To optimize application performance, routing and scheduling must be jointly considered at the level of a coflow rather than individual flows. However, prior solutions have significant limitation: they only consider scheduling, which is insufficient. To this end, we present Rapier, a coflow-aware network optimization framework that seamlessly integrates routing and scheduling for better application performance. Using a small-scale testbed implementation and large-scale simulations, we demonstrate that Rapier significantly reduces the average coflow completion time (CCT) by up to 79.30% compared to the state-of-the-art scheduling-only solution, and it is readily implementable with existing commodity switches.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Yangming Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yangming", "Kai Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0005:Kai", "Wei Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai_0001:Wei", "Minlan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Minlan", "Chen Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Chen", "Yanhui Geng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geng:Yanhui", "Yiming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yiming", "Dan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dan", "Sheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0006:Sheng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
