Here, we present a novel formulation for a neural network joint model (NNJM), which augments the NNLM with a source context window. Our model is purely lexicalized and can be integrated into any MT decoder. We also present several variations of the NNJM which provide significant additive improvements.", "citation": "Citations (375)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["BBN Technologies", "BBN Technologies", "BBN Technologies", "BBN Technologies", "BBN Technologies"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jacob Devlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Devlin:Jacob", "Rabih Zbib.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zbib:Rabih", "Zhongqiang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zhongqiang", "Thomas Lamar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lamar:Thomas", "Richard M.
