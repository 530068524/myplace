{"title": "Insomnia in the access: or how to curb access network related energy consumption.", "fields": ["broadband", "multiplexer", "digital subscriber line", "speedup", "distribution frame"], "abstract": "Access networks include modems, home gateways, and DSL Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs), and are responsible for 70-80% of total network-based energy consumption. In this paper, we take an in-depth look at the problem of greening access networks, identify root problems, and propose practical solutions for their user- and ISP-parts. On the user side, the combination of  continuous light traffic  and  lack of alternative paths  condemns gateways to being powered most of the time despite having Sleep-on-Idle (SoI) capabilities. To address this, we introduce Broadband Hitch-Hiking (BH 2 ), that takes advantage of the overlap of wireless networks to aggregate user traffic in as few gateways as possible. In current urban settings BH 2  can power off 65-90% of gateways. Powering off gateways permits the remaining ones to synchronize at higher speeds due to reduced crosstalk from having fewer active lines. Our tests reveal speedup up to 25%. On the ISP side, we propose introducing simple inexpensive switches at the distribution frame for batching active lines to a subset of cards letting the remaining ones sleep. Overall, our results show an 80% energy savings margin in access networks. The combination of B 2  and switching gets close to this margin, saving 66% on average.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Telef\u00f3nica", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Telef\u00f3nica", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Eduard Goma Llairo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Llairo:Eduard_Goma", "Marco Canini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canini:Marco", "Alberto L\u00f3pez Toledo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toledo:Alberto_L=oacute=pez", "Nikolaos Laoutaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laoutaris:Nikolaos", "Dejan Kostic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostic:Dejan", "Pablo Rodriguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodriguez:Pablo", "Rade Stanojevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stanojevic:Rade", "Pablo Yag\u00fce Valentin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valentin:Pablo_Yag=uuml=e"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
