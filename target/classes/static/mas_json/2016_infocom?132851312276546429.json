Users can alternatively download the video on-the-go, but that leads to high latency, depending on network bandwidth and video file size. In contrast, adaptive video streaming allows near-real-time viewing by streaming the best possible quality in a given network condition. This feature is achieved by keeping multiple versions of video in cloud, leading to additional costs in cloud storage. Moreover, current solutions can only support a small set of bitrates, leading to abrupt switches in video resolution especially when the network condition is unstable, as often experienced by mobile users. This paper introduces Vsync, a framework for cloud based video synchronization for mobile devices. A video content is streamed using a cloud-based real-time transcoding and transmission framework to provide smooth video quality. Built over prediction models for video transcoding sessions and a QoE based adaptive video streaming protocol, Vsync is able to obtain the improvements of 37 \u223c 80% than other compared schemes. The dataset and evaluation was done on a pool of 220K video clips.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Department of C ... lifornia, Davis", "Department of C ... lifornia, Davis", "Department of C ... lifornia, Davis", "Department of C ... lifornia, Davis"], "authors": ["Eilwoo Baik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baik:Eilwoo", "Amit Pande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pande:Amit", "Zizhan Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Zizhan", "Prasant Mohapatra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohapatra:Prasant"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
