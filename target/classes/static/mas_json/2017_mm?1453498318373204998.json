This work (i) compiles an affective ad dataset capable of evoking coherent emotions across users, as determined from the affective opinions of five experts and 14 annotators; (ii) explores the efficacy of convolutional neural network (CNN) features for encoding emotions, and observes that CNN features outperform low-level audio-visual emotion descriptors[9] upon extensive experimentation; and (iii) demonstrates how enhanced affect prediction facilitates computational advertising, and leads to better viewing experience while watching an online video stream embedded with ads based on a study involving 17 users. We model ad emotions based on subjective human opinions as well as objective multimodal features, and show how effectively modeling ad emotions can positively impact a real-life application.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "Indian Institute of Science", "Delft University of Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Abhinav Shukla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shukla:Abhinav", "Shruti Shriya Gullapuram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gullapuram:Shruti_Shriya", "Harish Katti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katti:Harish", "Karthik Yadati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yadati:Karthik", "Mohan S.
