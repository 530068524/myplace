We are particularly interested here in the case where the dimension  K  of \u03b2 is much higher than the dimension of  y . We propose some flexible Bayesian models which can yield sparse estimates of \u03b2. We show that as  K  \u2192 \u221e these models are closely related to a class of Levy processes. Simulations demonstrate that our models outperform significantly a range of popular alternatives.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Francois Caron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caron:Francois", "Arnaud Doucet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doucet:Arnaud"], "pages": 8}
