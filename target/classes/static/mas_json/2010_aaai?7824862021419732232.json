Based on the divide and conquer strategy, TSR divides the procedure of robust recognition into outlier detection stage and recognition stage. In the first stage, a weighted linear regression is used to learn a metric in which noise and outliers in image pixels are detected. In the second stage, based on the learnt metric, the large-scale dataset is firstly filtered into a small set according to the nearest neighbor criterion. Then a sparse representation is computed by the non-negative least squares technique. The sparse solution is unique and can be optimized efficiently. The extensive numerical experiments on several public databases demonstrate that the proposed TSR approach generally obtains better classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art Sparse Representation Classification (SRC). At the same time, by using the TSR, a significant reduction of computational cost is reached by over fifty times in comparison with the SRC, which enables the TSR to be deployed more suitably for large-scale dataset.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["Dalian University of Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Queen Mary University of London", "Dalian University of Technology"], "authors": ["Ran He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Ran", "Bao-Gang Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Bao=Gang", "Wei-Shi Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Wei=Shi", "Yanqing Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yanqing"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
