Interface specifications are expressed internally in an extension of LTL with first-order quantification; they can be transparently enforced on the client side using a small and invisible Java applet. Violations of the specification are reported on-the-fly and prevent erroneous or out-of-sequence XML messages from reaching the server.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Sylvain Hall\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hall=eacute=:Sylvain", "Roger Villemaire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Villemaire:Roger"], "pages": 6}
