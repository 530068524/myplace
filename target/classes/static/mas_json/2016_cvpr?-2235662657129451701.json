We propose to tackle this problem from the perspective of manifold learning. Our main idea is to align the semantic space that is derived from external information to the model space that concerns itself with recognizing visual features. To this end, we introduce a set of \"phantom\" object classes whose coordinates live in both the semantic space and the model space. Serving as bases in a dictionary, they can be optimized from labeled data such that the synthesized real object classifiers achieve optimal discriminative performance. We demonstrate superior accuracy of our approach over the state of the art on four benchmark datasets for zero-shot learning, including the full ImageNet Fall 2011 dataset with more than 20,000 unseen classes.", "citation": "Citations (137)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "U. of Central F ... rlando, FL, USA", "U. of Californi ... ngeles, CA, USA"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Soravit Changpinyo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Changpinyo:Soravit", "Wei-Lun Chao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chao:Wei=Lun", "Boqing Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Boqing", "Fei Sha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sha:Fei"], "pages": 10}
