In this paper, we connect the performance of Sparse Filtering with spectral properties of the corresponding feature matrices. This connection provides new insights into Sparse Filtering; in particular, it suggests early stopping of Sparse Filtering. We therefore introduce the Optimal Roundness Criterion (ORC), a novel stopping criterion for Sparse Filtering. We show that this stopping criterion is related with pre-processing procedures such as Statistical Whitening and demonstrate that it can make image classification with Sparse Filtering considerably faster and more accurate.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Johannes Lederer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lederer:Johannes", "Sergio Guadarrama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guadarrama:Sergio"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
