In-Place Augmented Reality Sketching experiences build on the intuitiveness and flexibility of hand sketching for tasks like content creation. In this paper we explore the design space of In-Place Augmented Reality Sketching, with particular attention to content authoring in games. We propose a contextual model that offers a framework for the exploration of this design space by the research community. We describe a sketch-based AR racing game we developed to demonstrate the proposed model. The game is developed on top of our shape recognition and 3D registration library for mobile AR.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Canterbury", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Canterbury", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Nate Hagbi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hagbi:Nate", "Rapha\u00ebl Grasset.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grasset:Rapha=euml=l", "Oriel Bergig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergig:Oriel", "Mark Billinghurst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Billinghurst:Mark", "Jihad El-Sana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/El=Sana:Jihad"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
