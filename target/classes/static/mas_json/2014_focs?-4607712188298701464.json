{"title": "(2 + epsilon)-Sat Is NP-Hard.", "fields": ["constraint satisfaction", "vertex", "existential quantification", "hypergraph", "probabilistic logic"], "abstract": "We prove the following hardness result for anatural promise variant of the classical CNF-satisfiabilityproblem: Given a CNF-formula where each clause has widthw and the guarantee that there exists an assignment satisfyingat least g = [w/2]--1 literals in each clause, it is NP-hard tofind a satisfying assignment to the formula (that sets at leastone literal to true in each clause). On the other hand, when g = [w/2], it is easy to find a satisfying assignment via simplegeneralizations of the algorithms for 2-SAT. Viewing 2-SAT \u2208 P as easiness of SAT when 1-in-2 literals are true in every clause, and NP-hardness of 3-SAT as intractability of SAT when 1-in-3 literals are true, our resultshows, for any fixed e > 0, the hardness of finding a satisfyingassignment to instances of \"(2 + e)-SAT\" where the density ofsatisfied literals in each clause is promised to exceed 1/(2+e). We also strengthen the results to prove that given a (2k + 1)-uniform hypergraph that can be 2-colored such that each edgehas perfect balance (at most k + 1 vertices of either color), itis NP-hard to find a 2-coloring that avoids a monochromaticedge. In other words, a set system with discrepancy 1 is hard todistinguish from a set system with worst possible discrepancy.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Sch. of Comput. ... ockholm, Sweden", "Sch. of Comput. ... ockholm, Sweden"], "authors": ["Per Austrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Austrin:Per", "Johan H\u00e5stad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=aring=stad:Johan", "Venkatesan Guruswami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guruswami:Venkatesan"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
