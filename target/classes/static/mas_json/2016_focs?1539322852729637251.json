A folklore result for this problem is that the largest root of a polynomial can be computed in O(n log (1/z)) polynomial queries using the Newton iteration. We give a simple algorithm that queries the oracle at only O(log n log(1/z)) points, where n is the degree of the polynomial. Our algorithm is based on a novel approach for accelerating the Newton method by using higher derivatives.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Anand Louis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Louis:Anand", "Santosh Srinivas Vempala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vempala:Santosh_Srinivas"], "pages": 9}
