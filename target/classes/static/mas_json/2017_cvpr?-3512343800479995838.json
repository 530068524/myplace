STNs are of interest to the vision and learning communities due to their natural ability to combine alignment and classification within the same theoretical framework. Inspired by the Inverse Compositional (IC) variant of the LK algorithm, we present Inverse Compositional Spatial Transformer Networks (IC-STNs). We demonstrate that IC-STNs can achieve better performance than conventional STNs with less model capacity, in particular, we show superior performance in pure image alignment tasks as well as joint alignment/classification problems on real-world problems.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chen-Hsuan Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chen=Hsuan", "Simon Lucey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucey:Simon"], "pages": 9}
