Beginning in 2003, our KnowItAll project has sought to extract high-quality knowledge from the Web.\n\nIn 2007, we introduced the Open Information Extraction (Open IE) paradigm which eschews hand-labeled training examples, and avoids domain-specific verbs and nouns, to develop unlexicalized, domain-independent extractors that scale to the Web corpus. Open IE systems have extracted billions of assertions as the basis for both common-sense knowledge and novel question-answering systems.\n\nThis paper describes the second generation of Open IE systems, which rely on a novel model of how relations and their arguments are expressed in English sentences to double precision/recall compared with previous systems such as TEXTRUNNER and WOE.", "citation": "Citations (434)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Oren Etzioni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etzioni:Oren", "Anthony Fader.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fader:Anthony", "Janara Christensen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Christensen:Janara", "Stephen Soderland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soderland:Stephen", "Mausam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mausam:"], "pages": 8}
