{"title": "Situation Calculus as Answer Set Programming.", "fields": ["fluent calculus", "solver", "answer set programming", "situation calculus", "stable model semantics"], "abstract": "We show how the situation calculus can be reformulated in terms of the first-order stable model semantics. A further transformation into answer set programs allows us to use an answer set solver to perform propositional reasoning about the situation calculus. We also provide an answer set programming style encoding method for Reiter's basic action theories, which tells us how the solution to the frame problem in answer set programming is related to the solution in the situation calculus.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Joohyung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joohyung", "Ravi Palla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palla:Ravi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
