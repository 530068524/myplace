{"title": "Application Crash Consistency and Performance with CCFS.", "fields": ["ext4", "crash", "parallel computing", "correctness", "file system", "streams", "computer science", "reliability engineering", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Recent research has shown that applications often incorrectly implement crash consistency. We present the Crash-Consistent File System (ccfs), a file system that improves the correctness of application-level crash consistency protocols while maintaining high performance. A key idea in ccfs is the abstraction of a  stream . Within a stream, updates are committed in program order, improving correctness; across streams, there are no ordering restrictions, enabling scheduling flexibility and high performance. We empirically demonstrate that applications running atop ccfs achieve high levels of crash consistency. Further, we show that ccfs performance under standard file-system benchmarks is excellent, in the worst case on par with the highest performing modes of Linux ext4, and in some cases notably better. Overall, we demonstrate that both application correctness and high performance can be realized in a modern file system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Thanumalayan Sankaranarayana Pillai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pillai:Thanumalayan_Sankaranarayana", "Ramnatthan Alagappan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alagappan:Ramnatthan", "Lanyue Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Lanyue", "Vijay Chidambaram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chidambaram:Vijay", "Andrea C.
