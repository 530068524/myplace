{"title": "Enhancing cache robustness for content-centric networking.", "fields": ["cache invalidation", "bus sniffing", "cache pollution", "smart cache", "cache stampede"], "abstract": "With the advent of content-centric networking (CCN) where contents can be cached on each CCN router, cache robustness will soon emerge as a serious concern for CCN deployment. Previous studies on cache pollution attacks only focus on a single cache server. The question of how caching will behave over a general caching network such as CCN under cache pollution attacks has never been answered. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called CacheShield for enhancing cache robustness. CacheShield is simple, easy-to-deploy, and applicable to any popular cache replacement policy. CacheShield can effectively improve cache performance under normal circumstances, and more importantly, shield CCN routers from cache pollution attacks. Extensive simulations including trace-driven simulations demonstrate that CacheShield is effective for both CCN and today's cache servers. We also study the impact of cache pollution attacks on CCN and reveal several new observations on how different attack scenarios can affect cache hit ratios unexpectedly.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "departments": ["University of Arkansas at Little Rock", "Bell Labs", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Mengjun Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Mengjun", "Indra Widjaja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Widjaja:Indra", "Haining Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haining"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
