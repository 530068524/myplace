{"title": "How carat affects user behavior: implications for mobile battery awareness applications.", "fields": ["battery", "android", "multimedia", "carat", "mobile device"], "abstract": "Mobile devices have limited battery life, and numerous battery management applications are available that aim to improve it. This paper examines a large-scale mobile battery awareness application, called Carat, to see how it changes user behavior with long-term use. We conducted a survey of current Carat Android users and analyzed their interaction logs. The results show that long-term Carat users save more battery, charge their devices less often, learn to manage their battery with less help from Carat, have a better understanding of how Carat works, and may enjoy competing against other users. Based on these findings, we propose a set of guidelines for mobile battery awareness applications: battery awareness applications should make the reasoning behind their recommendations understandable to the user, be tailored to retain long-term users, take the audience into account when formulating feedback, and distinguish third-party and system applications.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kumaripaba Athukorala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Athukorala:Kumaripaba", "Eemil Lagerspetz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lagerspetz:Eemil", "Maria von K\u00fcgelgen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=uuml=gelgen:Maria_von", "Antti Jylh\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jylh=auml=:Antti", "Adam J.
