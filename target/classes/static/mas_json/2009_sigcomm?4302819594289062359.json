Each of these differences gives rise to new challenges for implementing a wireless network in this band. We present the design and implementation of Net7, the first Wi-Fi like system constructed on top of UHF white spaces. Net7 incorporates a new adaptive spectrum assignment algorithm to handle spectrum variation and fragmentation, and proposes a low overhead protocol to handle temporal variation. builds on a simple technique, called SIFT, that reduces the time to detect transmissions in variable channel width systems by analyzing raw signals in the time domain. We provide an extensive evaluation of the system in terms of a prototype implementation and detailed experimental and simulation results.", "citation": "Citations (495)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Paramvir Bahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bahl:Paramvir", "Ranveer Chandra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandra:Ranveer", "Thomas Moscibroda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moscibroda:Thomas", "Rohan Murty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murty:Rohan", "Matt Welsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welsh:Matt"], "pages": 12}
