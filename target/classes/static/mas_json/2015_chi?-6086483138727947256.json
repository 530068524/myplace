{"title": "Trap it!: A Playful Human-Biology Interaction for a Museum Installation.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "touchscreen", "multimedia", "affordance", "human biology"], "abstract": "We developed Trap it!, a human-biology interaction (HBI) medium encompassing a touchscreen interface, microscopy, and light projection. Users can interact with living cells by drawing on a touchscreen displaying the microscope view of the cells. These drawings are projected onto the microscopy field as light patterns, prompting observable movement in phototactic responses. The system design enables stable and robust HBI and a wide variety of programmed activities (art, games, and experiments). We investigated its affordances as an exhibit in a science museum in both facilitated and unfacilitated contexts. Overall, it had a low barrier of entry and fostered rich communication among visitors. Visitors were particularly excited upon realizing that the interaction involved real organisms, an understanding that was facilitated by the eyepiece on the physical system. With the results from user study, we provide our observations, insights and guidelines for designing HBI as a permanent museum exhibit.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Seung Ah Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Seung_Ah", "Engin Bumbacher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bumbacher:Engin", "Alice M.
