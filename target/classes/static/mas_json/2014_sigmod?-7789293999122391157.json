{"title": "Reactive and proactive sharing across concurrent analytical queries.", "fields": ["data sharing", "serialization", "pipeline", "operator", "query plan"], "abstract": "Today an ever increasing amount of data is collected and analyzed by researchers, businesses, and scientists in data warehouses (DW). In addition to the data size, the number of users and applications querying data grows exponentially. The increasing concurrency is itself a challenge in query execution, but also introduces an opportunity favoring synergy between concurrent queries. Traditional execution engines of DW follows a query-centric approach, where each query is optimized and executed independently. On the other hand, workloads with increased concurrency have several queries with common parts of data and work, creating the opportunity for sharing among concurrent queries. Sharing can be reactive to the inherently existing sharing opportunities, or proactive by redesigning query operators to maximize the sharing opportunities. This demonstration showcases the impact of proactive and reactive sharing by comparing and integrating representative state-of-the-art techniques: Simultaneous Pipelining (SP), for reactive sharing, which shares intermediate results of common sub-plans, and Global Query Plans (GQP) for proactive sharing, which build and evaluate a single query plan with shared operators. We visually demonstrate, in an interactive interface, the behavior of both sharing approaches on top of a state-of-the-art storage engine using the original prototypes. We show that pull-based sharing for SP eliminates the serialization point imposed by the original push-based approach. Then, we compare, through a sensitivity analysis, the performance of SP and GQP. Finally, we show that SP can improve the performance of GQP for a query mix with common sub-plans.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Iraklis Psaroudakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Psaroudakis:Iraklis", "Manos Athanassoulis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Athanassoulis:Manos", "Matthaios Olma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olma:Matthaios", "Anastasia Ailamaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ailamaki:Anastasia"], "pages": 4}
