They can be faulty and exhibit runtime errors when environmental dynamics are not considered adequately. It becomes more severe when uncertainty exists in their sensing and adaptation to environments. Existing work verifies self-adaptive applications, but does not explicitly consider environmental constraints or uncertainty. This gives rise to inaccurate verification results. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel approach to verifying self-adaptive applications suffering uncertainty in their environmental interactions. It builds Interactive State Machine (ISM) models for such applications and verifies them with explicit consideration of environmental constraints and uncertainty. It then refines verification results by prioritizing counterexamples according to their probabilities. We experimentally evaluated our approach with real-life self-adaptive applications, and the experimental results confirmed its effectiveness. Our approach reported 200-660% more counterexamples than not considering uncertainty, and eliminated all false counterexamples caused by ignoring environmental constraints.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Wenhua Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Wenhua", "Chang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Chang", "Yepang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yepang", "Chun Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Chun", "Xiaoxing Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiaoxing", "Jian Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0001:Jian"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
