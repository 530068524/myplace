Our algorithm ensures vector-quantization accuracy similar to that of computationally-expensive PCA trees with similar time-complexity to that of lower-accuracy RP trees.\n\nAPD trees use a small number of power-method iterations to find splitting planes for recursively partitioning the data. As such they provide a natural trade-off between the running-time and accuracy achieved by RP and PCA trees. Our theoretical results establish a) strong performance guarantees regardless of the convergence rate of the power-method and b) that O(log d) iterations suffice to establish the guarantee of PCA trees when the intrinsic dimension is d. We demonstrate this trade-off and the efficacy of our data structure on both the CPU and GPU.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Mark McCartin-Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCartin=Lim:Mark", "Andrew McGregor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGregor_0001:Andrew", "Rui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Rui"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
