We created Tableau Machine (TM) to explore the parts of home life that are unrelated to accomplishing tasks. Task support for \"smart homes\" has inspired many researchers in the community. We consider design for experience, an orthogonal dimension to task-centric home life. TM produces abstract visualizations on a large LCD every few minutes, driven by a set of four overhead cameras that capture a sense of the social life of a domestic space. The openness and ambiguity of TM allow for a cycle of co-interpretation with householders. We report on three longitudinal deployments of TM for a period of six weeks. Participant families engaged with TM at the outset to understand how their behaviors were influencing the machine, and, while TM remained puzzling, householders interacted richly with TM and its images. We extract some key design implications for an experience-focused smart home.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Zachary Pousman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pousman:Zachary", "Mario Romero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romero:Mario", "Adam M.
