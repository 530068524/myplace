{"title": "Transformative Appetite: Shape-Changing Food Transforms from 2D to 3D by Water Interaction through Cooking.", "fields": ["transformative learning", "2d to 3d conversion", "human computer interaction", "interaction design", "process engineering"], "abstract": "We developed a concept of transformative appetite, where edible 2D films made of common food materials (protein, cellulose or starch) can transform into 3D food during cooking. This transformation process is triggered by water adsorption, and it is strongly compatible with the 'flat packaging' concept for substantially reducing shipping costs and storage space. To develop these transformable foods, we performed material-based design, established a hybrid fabrication strategy, and conducted performance simulation. Users can customize food shape transformations through a pre-defined simulation platform, and then fabricate these designed patterns using additive manufacturing. Three application techniques are provided - 2D-to-3D folding, hydration-induced wrapping, and temperature-induced self-fragmentation, to present the shape, texture, and interaction with food materials. Based on this concept, several dishes were created in the kitchen, to demonstrate the futuristic dining experience through materials-based interaction design.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Syracuse University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Wen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Wen", "Lining Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Lining", "Teng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Teng", "Chin-Yi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Chin=Yi", "Daniel S.
