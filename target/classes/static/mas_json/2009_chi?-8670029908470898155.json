But what influences whether and how a \"helper\" will provide help? To answer this question, we conducted a qualitative investigation of people who participated in computer support activities with family and friends in the past year. We describe how factors including maintenance of one's personal identity as a computer expert and accountability to one's social network determine who receives help and the quality of help provided. We also discuss the complex, fractured relationship between the numerous stakeholders involved in the upkeep of home computing infrastructures. Based on our findings, we provide implications for the design of systems to support informal help-giving in residential settings.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Erika Shehan Poole.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poole:Erika_Shehan", "Marshini Chetty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chetty:Marshini", "Tom Morgan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morgan:Tom", "Rebecca E.
