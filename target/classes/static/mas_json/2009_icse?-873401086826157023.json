{"title": "Invariant-based automatic testing of AJAX user interfaces.", "fields": ["web crawler", "test suite", "ajax", "discoverability", "web application"], "abstract": "AJAX-based Web 2.0 applications rely on stateful asynchronous client/server communication, and client-side runtime manipulation of the DOM tree. This not only makes them fundamentally different from traditional web applications, but also more error-prone and harder to test. We propose a method for testing AJAX applications automatically, based on a crawler to infer a flow graph for all (client-side) user interface states. We identify AJAX-specific faults that can occur in such states (related to DOM validity, error messages, discoverability, back-button compatibility, etc.) as well as DOM-tree invariants that can serve as oracle to detect such faults. We implemented our approach in ATUSA, a tool offering generic invariant checking components, a plugin-mechanism to add application-specific state validators, and generation of a test suite covering the paths obtained during crawling. We describe two case studies evaluating the fault revealing capabilities, scalability, required manual effort and level of automation of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (238)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Ali Mesbah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mesbah_0001:Ali", "Arie van Deursen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deursen:Arie_van"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 11}
