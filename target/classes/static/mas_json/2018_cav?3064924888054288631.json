{"title": "From Programs to Interpretable Deep Models and Back.", "fields": ["deep learning", "programmer", "closed captioning", "source code", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "We demonstrate how deep learning over programs is used to provide (preliminary) augmented programmer intelligence. In the first part, we show how to tackle tasks like code completion, code summarization, and captioning. We describe a general path-based representation of source code that can be used across programming languages and learning tasks, and discuss how this representation enables different learning algorithms. In the second part, we describe techniques for extracting interpretable representations from deep models, shedding light on what has actually been learned in various tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Eran Yahav.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yahav:Eran"], "pages": 11}
