{"title": "A Study of SVM Kernel Functions for Sensitivity Classification Ensembles with POS Sequences.", "fields": ["information sensitivity", "kernel", "one class classification", "mcnemar s test", "ensemble learning"], "abstract": "Freedom of Information (FOI) laws legislate that government documents should be  opened  to the public. However, many government documents contain  sensitive  information, such as  confidential  information, that is exempt from release. Therefore, government documents must be  sensitivity reviewed  prior to release, to identify and  close  any sensitive information. With the adoption of born-digital documents, such as email, there is a need for automatic sensitivity classification to assist  digital sensitivity review . SVM classifiers and Part-of-Speech sequences have separately been shown to be promising for sensitivity classification. However, sequence classification methodologies, and specifically SVM kernel functions, have not been fully investigated for sensitivity classification. Therefore, in this work, we present an evaluation of five SVM kernel functions for sensitivity classification using POS sequences. Moreover, we show that an  ensemble  classifier that combines POS sequence classification with text classification can significantly improve sensitivity classification effectiveness (+6.09% F 2 ) compared with a text classification baseline, according to McNemar's test of significance.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of C\u00f3rdoba", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "authors": ["Graham McDonald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McDonald:Graham", "Nicol\u00e1s Garc\u00eda-Pedrajas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garc=iacute=a=Pedrajas:Nicol=aacute=s", "Craig Macdonald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Macdonald:Craig", "Iadh Ounis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ounis:Iadh"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
