In this paper, we introduce SMAS, our smart meter analytics system, which demonstrates the actionable insight that consumers and utilities can obtain from smart meter data. Notably, we implemented SMAS inside a relational database management system using open source tools: PostgreSQL and the MADLib machine learning toolkit. In the proposed demonstration, conference attendees will interact with SMAS as electricity providers, consultants and consumers, and will perform various analyses on real data sets.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Xiufeng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiufeng", "Lukasz Golab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golab:Lukasz", "Ihab F.
