{"title": "\"Garbage in, garbage out\": extracting disease surveillance data from epr systems in primary care.", "fields": ["disease surveillance", "medical diagnosis", "sociotechnical system", "garbage in garbage out", "computer supported cooperative work"], "abstract": "This paper presents an interpretive case study on extraction of disease surveillance data from Electronic Patient Records (EPRs) in primary care. The General Practitioners (GPs) use of the EPR system, and the effect this has on data content, such as symptoms reported by patients and diagnoses reported by GPs, is discussed. The paper contributes to greater understanding of sociotechnical issues related to disease surveillance, and contains illustrative examples of many issues important to CSCW. This includes how data collected in one context may be applied to a different context, and the delicate interplay between organizational and technical design challenges.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University Hospital of North Norway", "University Hospital of North Norway", "University Hospital of North Norway", "University of Troms\u00f8", "University Hospital of North Norway"], "authors": ["Monika Alise Johansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johansen:Monika_Alise", "Jeremiah Scholl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scholl:Jeremiah", "Per Hasvold.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasvold:Per", "Gunnar Ellingsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ellingsen:Gunnar", "Johan Gustav Bellika.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellika:Johan_Gustav"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
