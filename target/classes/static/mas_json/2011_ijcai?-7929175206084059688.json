In this setting, a set of probability measures (priors) is defined instead of a single one, and the decision maker selects a strategy that maximizes the minimum possible value of expected utility over this set of priors. We are interested here in the resolute choice approach, where one initially commits to a complete strategy and never deviates from it later. Given a decision tree representation with multiple priors, we study the problem of determining an optimal strategy from the root according to min expected utility. We prove the intractability of evaluating a strategy in the general case. We then identify different properties of a decision tree that enable to design dedicated resolution procedures. Finally, experimental results are presented that evaluate these procedures.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Paul Sabatier University", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fargier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fargier:H=eacute=l=egrave=ne", "Gildas Jeantet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeantet:Gildas", "Olivier Spanjaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spanjaard:Olivier"], "pages": 6}
