Tightly coupling  in situ  visualization with simulations constrains resources for both, and these constraints force a complex balance of trade-offs. A performance model that provides an  a priori  answer for the cost of using an  in situ  approach for a given task would assist in managing the trade-offs between simulation and visualization resources. In this work, we present new statistical performance models, based on algorithmic complexity, that accurately predict the run-time cost of a set of representative rendering algorithms, an essential  in situ  visualization task. To train and validate the models, we conduct a performance study of an MPI+X rendering infrastructure used  in situ  with three HPC simulation applications. We then explore feasibility issues using the model for selected  in situ  rendering questions.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Matthew Larsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsen:Matthew", "Cyrus Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Cyrus", "James Kress.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kress:James", "David Pugmire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pugmire:David", "Jeremy S.
