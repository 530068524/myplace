One crucial research issue in transfer learning is how to find a good representation for instances of different domains such that the divergence between domains can be reduced with the new representation. Recently, deep learning has been proposed to learn more robust or higherlevel features for transfer learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the previous approaches neither minimize the difference between domains explicitly nor encode label information in learning the representation. In this paper, we propose a supervised representation learning method based on deep autoencoders for transfer learning. The proposed deep autoencoder consists of two encoding layers: an embedding layer and a label encoding layer. In the embedding layer, the distance in distributions of the embedded instances between the source and target domains is minimized in terms of KL-Divergence. In the label encoding layer, label information of the source domain is encoded using a softmax regression model. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Nanyang Technological University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Fuzhen Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Fuzhen", "Xiaohu Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiaohu", "Ping Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo_0001:Ping", "Sinno Jialin Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Sinno_Jialin", "Qing He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Qing"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
