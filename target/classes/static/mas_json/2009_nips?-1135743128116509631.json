We introduce a simple distribution-free encoding scheme based on random projections, such that the expected Hamming distance between the binary codes of two vectors is related to the value of a shift-invariant kernel (e.g., a Gaussian kernel) between the vectors. We present a full theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed scheme, and report favorable experimental performance as compared to a recent state-of-the-art method, spectral hashing.", "citation": "Citations (561)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Duke University", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Maxim Raginsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raginsky:Maxim", "Svetlana Lazebnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazebnik:Svetlana"], "pages": 9}
