{"title": "Night Fishing with Cormorants.", "fields": ["meditation", "animation", "painting", "fishing", "reverence"], "abstract": "This animation is a very loose and abstract meditation, inspired in part by the 17th Century Japanese screen painting by Kano Tanyu, Night Fishing with Cormorants, and by the very stark and beautiful novel of Akira Yoshimura,  Shipwrecks . I am not telling a naturalistic story in this piece, but rather I have tried to make a work that can hold in equal reverence the spirit of the bird, the fish, and the fisherman.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": [], "conf": "siggraph", "authors": ["Betsy Kopmar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopmar:Betsy"], "pages": 1}
