Currently, 3D video systems still require excessive bandwidth and computation power provided by gigabit switches and multi-core workstations machines. In order to extend the experience to mobile devices, we present a view-dependent compression methodology that shows great promise in making 3D video a reality on resource-constrained mobile devices. Using our technology, we are able to achieve a software-only rendering on a Nokia N800 PDA with only wireless network transmission. We believe that with the use of newer handhelds and improvements to our compression techniques, we will be able to deliver full-motion 3D video soon.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Shu Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Shu", "Klara Nahrstedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nahrstedt:Klara", "Roy H.
