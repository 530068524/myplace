In this paper, we identify, analyze and address the synchronization (sync) inefficiency problem of modern mobile cloud storage services. Our measurement results demonstrate that existing commercial sync services fail to make full use of available bandwidth, and generate a large amount of unnecessary sync traffic in certain circumstance even though the incremental sync is implemented. These issues are caused by the inherent limitations of the sync protocol and the distributed architecture. Based on our findings, we propose QuickSync, a system with three novel techniques to improve the sync efficiency for mobile cloud storage services, and build the system on two commercial sync services. Our experimental results using representative workloads show that QuickSync is able to reduce up to 52.9% sync time in our experiment settings.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Stony Brook University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Stony Brook University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yong Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui_0001:Yong", "Zeqi Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Zeqi", "Xin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xin", "Ningwei Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Ningwei", "Congcong Miao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miao:Congcong"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
