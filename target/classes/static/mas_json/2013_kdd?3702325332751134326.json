We witness a growing interest in clustering a social network of people based on both their social relationships and their participations in activity based information networks. In this paper, we present a social influence based clustering framework for analyzing heterogeneous information networks with three unique features. First, we introduce a novel social influence based vertex similarity metric in terms of both self-influence similarity and co-influence similarity. We compute self-influence and co-influence based similarity based on social graph and its associated activity graphs and influence graphs respectively. Second, we compute the combined social influence based similarity between each pair of vertices by unifying the self-similarity and multiple co-influence similarity scores through a weight function with an iterative update method. Third, we design an iterative learning algorithm, SI-Cluster, to dynamically refine the K clusters by continuously quantifying and adjusting the weights on self-influence similarity and on multiple co-influence similarity scores towards the clustering convergence. To make SI-Cluster converge fast, we transformed a sophisticated nonlinear fractional programming problem of multiple weights into a straightforward nonlinear parametric programming problem of single variable. Our experiment results show that SI-Cluster not only achieves a better balance between self-influence and co-influence similarities but also scales extremely well for large graph clustering.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Yang", "Ling Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ling"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
