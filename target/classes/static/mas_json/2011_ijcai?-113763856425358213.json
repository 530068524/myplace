{"title": "WSABIE: Scaling Up to Large Vocabulary Image Annotation.", "fields": ["scaling", "ranking", "vocabulary", "embedding", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "Image annotation datasets are becoming larger and larger, with tens of millions of images and tens of thousands of possible annotations. We propose a strongly performing method that scales to such datasets by simultaneously learning to optimize precision at the top of the ranked list of annotations for a given image and learning a low-dimensional joint embedding space for both images and annotations. Our method, called WSABIE, both outperforms several baseline methods and is faster and consumes less memory.", "citation": "Citations (443)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "University of Paris"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jason Weston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weston:Jason", "Samy Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Samy", "Nicolas Usunier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Usunier:Nicolas"], "pages": 7}
