{"title": "VR 2012 tutorial: Quantitative and qualitative methods for human-subject experiments in Virtual and Augmented Reality.", "fields": ["formative assessment", "virtual reality", "user interface design", "augmented reality", "usability"], "abstract": "This tutorial is for researchers and engineers, working in the field of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), who wish to conduct user-based experiments with a specific aim of promoting both traditional quantitative human-subject experiments and qualitative methods for assessing usability. This tutorial is for a full-day tutorial presenting both quantitative and qualitative approaches to conducting human-subject experiments. It covers (1) the basic principles of experimental design and analysis, with an emphasis on human-subject experiments in VR/AR; (2) qualitative studies (e.g., formative evaluation methods) for assessing and improving VR/AR user interfaces and user interaction along with lessons learned from conducting many user-based studies; and (3) a \u201cjournalistic approach\u201d to measuring human performance that organizes the activity around questions such as \u201cWho? What? When? Where? How? and Why?\u201d.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Mississippi State University", "Ames Research Center"], "authors": ["Joseph L.
