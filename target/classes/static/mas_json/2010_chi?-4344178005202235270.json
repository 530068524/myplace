We propose an animation technique for smoothly transitioning between different text revisions, then present the Diffamation system. Diffamation supports rapid exploration of revision histories by combining text animated transitions with simple navigation and visualization tools. We finally describe a user study showing that smooth text animation allows users to track changes in the evolution of textual documents more effectively than flipping pages.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "INIRA, Orsay, France"], "authors": ["Fanny Chevalier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chevalier:Fanny", "Pierre Dragicevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dragicevic:Pierre", "Anastasia Bezerianos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bezerianos:Anastasia", "Jean-Daniel Fekete.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fekete:Jean=Daniel"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
