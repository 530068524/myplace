Such a design provides a cost-effective solution for processor manufacturers to continuously improve both single-thread performance and multi-thread throughput. This design, however, faces significant challenges in the operating system, which traditionally assumes only homogeneous hardware. This paper presents a comprehensive study of OS support for heterogeneous architectures in which cores have asymmetric performance and overlapping, but non-identical instruction sets. Our algorithms allow applications to transparently execute and fairly share different types of cores. We have implemented these algorithms in the Linux 2.6.24 kernel and evaluated them on an actual heterogeneous platform. Evaluation results demonstrate that our designs efficiently manage heterogeneous hardware and enable significant performance improvements for a range of applications.", "citation": "Citations (152)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Tong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Tong", "Paul Brett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brett:Paul", "Rob C.
