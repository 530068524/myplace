{"title": "Unboundedness and downward closures of higher-order pushdown automata.", "fields": ["pushdown automaton", "closure", "decidability", "diagonal", "recursion"], "abstract": "We show the diagonal problem for higher-order pushdown automata (HOPDA), and hence the simultaneous unboundedness problem, is decidable. From recent work by Zetzsche this means that we can construct the downward closure of the set of words accepted by a given HOPDA. This also means we can construct the downward closure of the Parikh image of a HOPDA. Both of these consequences play an important role in verifying concurrent higher-order programs expressed as HOPDA or safe higher-order recursion schemes.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of London", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Matthew Hague.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hague:Matthew", "Jonathan Kochems.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kochems:Jonathan", "C.-H.
