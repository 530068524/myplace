Retrieving previously \u201cpersisted\u201d objects from classes whose schema changed is however difficult, and may lead to invalidating the consistency of the application. The ESCHER framework addresses this issues through an IDE-based approach that handles schema evolution by managing versions of the code and generating transformation functions automatically. The infrastructure also enforces class invariants to prevent the introduction of any corrupt objects. This article describes the principles behind invariant-safe schema evolution,and the design and implementation of the ESCHER system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "University of York", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Marco Piccioni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piccioni:Marco", "Manuel Oriol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oriol:Manuel", "Bertrand Meyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyer_0001:Bertrand", "Teseo Schneider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schneider:Teseo"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
