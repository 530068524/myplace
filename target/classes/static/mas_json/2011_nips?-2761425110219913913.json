{"title": "Two is better than one: distinct roles for familiarity and recollection in retrieving palimpsest memories.", "fields": ["recognition memory", "recall", "machine learning", "autoassociative memory", "coupling"], "abstract": "Storing a new pattern in a palimpsest memory system comes at the cost of interfering with the memory traces of previously stored items. Knowing the age of a pattern thus becomes critical for recalling it faithfully. This implies that there should be a tight coupling between estimates of age, as a form of familiarity, and the neural dynamics of recollection, something which current theories omit. Using a normative model of autoassociative memory, we show that a dual memory system, consisting of two interacting modules for familiarity and recollection, has best performance for both recollection and recognition. This finding provides a new window onto actively contentious psychological and neural aspects of recognition memory.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University College London", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Cristina Savin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savin:Cristina", "Peter Dayan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dayan:Peter", "M\u00e1t\u00e9 Lengyel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lengyel:M=aacute=t=eacute="], "pages": 9}
