{"title": "Inapproximability of Combinatorial Problems via Small LPs and SDPs.", "fields": ["bounded function", "dense graph", "semidefinite programming", "combinatorial optimization", "vertex cover"], "abstract": "Motivated by [12], we provide a framework for studying the size of linear programming formulations as well as semidefinite programming formulations of combinatorial optimization problems without encoding them first as linear programs. This is done via a factorization theorem for the optimization problem itself (and not a specific encoding of such). As a result we define a consistent reduction mechanism that degrades approximation factors in a controlled fashion and which, at the same time, is compatible with approximate linear and semidefinite programming formulations. Moreover, our reduction mechanism is a minor restriction of classical reductions establishing inapproximability in the context of PCP theorems. As a consequence we establish strong linear programming inapproximability (for LPs with a polynomial number of constraints) for several problems that are not 0/1-CSPs: we obtain a 3/2-epsilon inapproximability for Vertex Cover (which is not of the CSP type) answering an open question in [12], we answer a weak version of our sparse graph conjecture posed in [6] showing an inapproximability factor of 1/2+e for bounded degree IndependentSet, and we establish inapproximability of MaxMULTICUT (a non-binary CSP). In the case of SDPs, we obtain relative inapproximability results for these problems.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["G\u00e1bor Braun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braun:G=aacute=bor", "Sebastian Pokutta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pokutta:Sebastian", "Daniel Zink.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zink:Daniel"], "pages": 10}
