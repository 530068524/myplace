{"title": "Photometric compensation for practical and complex textures.", "fields": ["motion capture", "bilateral filter", "photometry", "projector", "pixel"], "abstract": "We propose a photometric compensation for projecting arbitrary images on practical surfaces of our everyday life. Although many previous proposals have achieved fine compensation at their experimental environments [Nayar et al. 2003], they cannot support practical targets including high-contrast texture. In order to adapt to such situation, we need a time-consuming iterative processing with camera feedback. Even though the iterative processing is applied, we cannot obtain fine compensation because no camera pixels of a projector-camera system (procam) correspond perfectly to the pixels of the projector [Mihara et al. 2014].", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Electro-Communications", "University of Electro-Communications"], "authors": ["Naoki Hashimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hashimoto:Naoki", "Koki Kosaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosaka:Koki"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
