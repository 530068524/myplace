{"title": "On quantification of anchor placement.", "fields": ["tree traversal", "trajectory", "gradient descent", "ranging", "noise measurement"], "abstract": "This paper attempts to answer a question: for a given traversal area, how to quantify the geometric impact of anchor placement on localization performance. We present a theoretical framework for quantifying the anchor placement impact. An experimental study, as well as the field test using a UWB ranging technology, is presented. These experimental results validate the theoretical analysis. As a byproduct, we propose a two-phase localization method (TPLM) and show that TPLM outperforms the least-square method in localization accuracy by a huge margin. TPLM performs much faster than the gradient descent method and slightly better than the gradient descent method in localization accuracy. Our field test suggests that TPLM is more robust against noise than the least-square and gradient descent methods.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Telcordia Technologies", "Telcordia Technologies", "Telcordia Technologies"], "authors": ["Yibei Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Yibei", "Scott Alexander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alexander:Scott", "Richard Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Richard"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
