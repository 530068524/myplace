The crowd opinion is here expressed by the distribution of ratings given by a sufficient amount of people. Consequently, the pre-release crowd opinion prediction can be regarded as a Label Distribution Learning (LDL) problem. In order to solve this problem, a Label Distribution Support Vector Regressor (LDSVR) is proposed in this paper. The basic idea of LDSVR is to fit a sigmoid function to each component of the label distribution simultaneously by a multi-output support vector machine. Experimental results show that LDSVR can accurately predict peoples's rating distribution about a movie just based on the pre-release metadata of the movie.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Southeast University", "Southeast University"], "authors": ["Xin Geng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geng:Xin", "Peng Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:Peng"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
