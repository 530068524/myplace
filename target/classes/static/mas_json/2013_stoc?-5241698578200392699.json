The  extension problem  asks, given topological spaces X,Y, a subspace A \u2286 X, and a (continuous) map f:A -> Y, whether f can be extended to a map X -> Y. For computational purposes, we assume that X and Y are represented as finite simplicial complexes, A is a subcomplex of X, and f is given as a simplicial map. In this generality the problem is undecidable, as follows from Novikov's result from the 1950s on uncomputability of the fundamental group \u03c0 1 (Y). We thus study the problem under the assumption that, for some k \u2265 2, Y is (k-1)-connected; informally, this means that Y has \"no holes up to dimension k-1\" i.e., the first k-1 homotopy groups of Y vanish (a basic example of such a Y is the sphere S k ).   We prove that, on the one hand, this problem is still undecidable for dim X=2k. On the other hand, for every fixed k \u2265 2, we obtain an algorithm that solves the extension problem in polynomial time assuming Y (k-1)-connected and dim X \u2264 2k-1$. For dim X \u2264 2k-2, the algorithm also provides a classification of all extensions up to homotopy (continuous deformation). This relies on results of our SODA 2012 paper, and the main new ingredient is a machinery of  objects with polynomial-time homology , which is a polynomial-time analog of objects with effective homology developed earlier by Sergeraert et al.   We also consider the computation of the higher homotopy groups \u03c0 k (Y)$, k \u2265 2, for a 1-connected Y. Their computability was established by Brown in 1957; we show that \u03c0 k (Y) can be computed in polynomial time for every fixed k \u2265 2. On the other hand, Anick proved in 1989 that computing \u03c0 k (Y) is #P-hard if k is a part of input, where Y is a cell complex with certain rather compact encoding. We strengthen his result to #P-hardness for Y given as a simplicial complex.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Masaryk University", "Charles University in Prague", "Charles University in Prague", "Masaryk University", "Institute of Sc ... euburg, Austria"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Martin Cadek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cadek:Martin", "Marek Krc\u00e1l.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krc=aacute=l:Marek", "Jir\u00ed Matousek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matousek:Jir=iacute=", "Luk\u00e1s Vokr\u00ednek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vokr=iacute=nek:Luk=aacute=s", "Uli Wagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagner_0001:Uli"], "pages": 10}
