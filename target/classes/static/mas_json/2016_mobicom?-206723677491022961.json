But the lack of an accessible experimental platform has been impeding its progress. In this paper, we overcome the barrier with OpenMili, a reconfigurable 60 GHz radio architecture. OpenMili builds from off-the-shelf FPGA processor, data converters and 60 GHz RF front-end. It employs customized clocking, channelization and interfacing modules, to achieve Gsps sampling bandwidth, Gbps wireless bit-rate, and Gsps sample streaming from/to a PC host. It also incorporates the first programmable, electronically steerable 60 GHz phased-array antenna. OpenMili adopts programming models that ease development, through automatic parallelization inside signal processing blocks, and modular, rate-insensitive interfaces across blocks. It provides common reference designs to bootstrap the development of new network protocols and sensing applications. We verify the effectiveness of OpenMili through benchmark communication/sensing experiments, and showcase its usage by prototyping a pairwise phased-array localization scheme, and a learning-assisted real-time beam adaptation protocol.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Jialiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jialiang", "Xinyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xinyu", "Pushkar Kulkarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulkarni:Pushkar", "Parameswaran Ramanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanathan:Parameswaran"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
