To make matters worse, workloads can overstress specific destinations, creating hotspots. Lossless networks offer attractive advantages compared to lossy networks but suffer from tree saturation. This led to the development of explicit congestion notification (ECN). However, ECN is very sensitive to its configuration parameters and acts only after congestion forms. We propose channel reservation protocol (CRP) to enable sources to reserve bandwidth in  multiple  resources in advance of packet transmission and with a  single  request, but without idling resources like circuit switching. CRP prevents congestion from ever occurring and thus reacts instantly to traffic changes, whereas ECN requires 300,000 cycles to stabilize in our experiments. Furthermore, ECN may not prevent congestion formed by short-lived flows generated by a large combination of source--destination pairs.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["George Michelogiannakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michelogiannakis:George", "Nan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Nan", "Daniel U.
