{"title": "Explicit Semantic Ranking for Academic Search via Knowledge Graph Embedding.", "fields": ["ranking", "graph embedding", "graph database", "search engine"], "abstract": "This paper introduces Explicit Semantic Ranking (ESR), a new ranking technique that leverages knowledge graph embedding. Analysis of the query log from our academic search engine, SemanticScholar.org, reveals that a major error source is its inability to understand the meaning of research concepts in queries. To addresses this challenge, ESR represents queries and documents in the entity space and ranks them based on their semantic connections from their knowledge graph embedding. Experiments demonstrate ESR's ability in improving Semantic Scholar's online production system, especially on hard queries where word-based ranking fails.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Allen Institute ... attle, WA, USA"], "authors": ["Chenyan Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Chenyan", "Russell Power.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Power:Russell", "Jamie Callan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Callan:Jamie"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
