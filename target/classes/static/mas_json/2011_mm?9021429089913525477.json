Ideally, only one copy of each object of interest would be labeled manually, and the labels would then be propagated automatically to all other occurrences of the objects in the database. To that end, we propose a neighbor-based influence propagation approach KProp which builds a voting model and propagates the knowledge associated to some objects to similar objects. We show that KProp can perform efficiently through matrix computations and achieve better performance with fewer labeled examples per object.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics", "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "National Institute of Informatics", "New Jersey Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Michael E.
