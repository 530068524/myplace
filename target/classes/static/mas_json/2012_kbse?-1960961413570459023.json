PuMoC allows to do CTL model-checking w.r.t simple valuations, where the atomic propositions depend on the control locations of the PDSs, and w.r.t. regular valuations, where atomic propositions are regular predicates over the stack content. Our tool allowed to (1) check 500 randomly generated PDSs against several CTL formulas; (2) check around 1461 versions of 30 Windows drivers taken from SLAM benchmarks; (3) check several C and Java programs; and (4) perform data flow analysis of real-world Java programs. Our results show the efficiency and the applicability of our tool.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Fu Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Fu", "Tayssir Touili.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Touili:Tayssir"], "pages": 4}
