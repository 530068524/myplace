More precisely, we prove that there exists a constant \u03f5 > 0 such that, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis for PPAD, computing an \u03f5-approximate Nash equilibrium in a two-player  n  \u00d7  n  game requires time  n  log 1\u2212o(1)   n  . This matches (up to the  o  (1) term) the algorithm of Lipton, Markakis, and Mehta [Lipton et al. 2003].", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Aviad Rubinstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubinstein:Aviad"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
