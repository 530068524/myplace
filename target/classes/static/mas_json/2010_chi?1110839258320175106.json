{"title": "The effect of audience design on labeling, organizing, and finding shared files.", "fields": ["common ground", "producer consumer problem", "audience design", "group information management", "information mapping"], "abstract": "In an online experiment, I apply theory from psychology and communications to find out whether group information management tasks are governed by the same communication processes as conversation. This paper describes results that replicate previous research, and expand our knowledge about audience design and packaging for future reuse when communication is mediated by a co-constructed artifact like a file-and-folder hierarchy. Results indicate that it is easier for information consumers to search for files in hierarchies created by information producers who imagine their intended audience to be someone similar to them, independent of whether the producer and consumer actually share common ground. This research helps us better understand packaging choices made by information producers, and the direct implications of those choices for other users of group information systems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Emilee J.
