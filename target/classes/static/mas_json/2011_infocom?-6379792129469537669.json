{"title": "Effect of buffers on stability of Internet congestion controllers.", "fields": ["heuristic", "queueing theory", "stability theory", "exponential stability", "network congestion"], "abstract": "Almost all existing fluid models of congestion control assume that the fluid flow at the output of a link is the same as the fluid flow at the input of the link. This means that all links in the path of a flow see the original source rate. In reality, a fluid flow is modified by the queueing processes on its path, so that an intermediate link will generally not see the original source rate. In this paper, we propose a simple model that explicitly takes into account of the effect of buffering on output flows. We study the dual and primal-dual algorithms that use implicit feedback and show that, while they are always asymptotically stable if feedback delay is ignored, they can be unstable in the new model.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Somayeh Sojoudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sojoudi:Somayeh", "Steven H.
