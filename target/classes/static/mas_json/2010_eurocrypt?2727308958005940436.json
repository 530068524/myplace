A scheme of that type relies on the quantum-physical phenomenon of non-local correlations and on the assumption that no illegitimate information flows within and between Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s laboratories. The latter can be enforced via the non-signaling postulate of relativity if all measurements are carried out simultaneously enough.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Esther H\u00e4nggi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=nggi:Esther", "Renato Renner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Renner:Renato", "Stefan Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf_0001:Stefan"], "pages": 19}
