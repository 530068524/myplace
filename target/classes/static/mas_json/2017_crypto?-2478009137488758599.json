J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 2000) Alice and Bob, who hold inputs x and y respectively, wish to release a common secret s to Carol (who knows both x and y) if and only if the input (x, y) satisfies some predefined predicate f. Alice and Bob are allowed to send a single message to Carol which may depend on their inputs and some joint randomness and the goal is to minimize the communication complexity while providing information-theoretic security.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Benny Applebaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Applebaum:Benny", "Barak Arkis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arkis:Barak", "Pavel Raykov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raykov:Pavel", "Prashant Nalini Vasudevan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasudevan:Prashant_Nalini"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 31}
