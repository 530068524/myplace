We aim to generate ROI cutout automatically for further processing such as image editing, classification and information retrieval. Different from traditional semi-supervised segmentation method, we use a rather weak prior on boundary label. Accordingly, a global cost function is proposed to combine our prior knowledge with pixel-level feature. We compute fuzzy matting components as building blocks to construct semantically meaningful mattes. Finally, these mattes are hierarchically clustered and ranked by central preference. Experimental results on a large benchmark data set demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Zhuoyuan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhuoyuan", "Lifeng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Lifeng", "Shiqiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shiqiang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
