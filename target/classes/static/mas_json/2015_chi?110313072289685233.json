{"title": "TabLETS Get Physical: Non-Visual Text Entry on Tablet Devices.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "touchscreen", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "Tablet devices can display full-size QWERTY keyboards similar to the physical ones. Yet, the lack of tactile feedback and the inability to rest the fingers on the home keys result in a highly demanding and slow exploration task for blind users. We present SpatialTouch, an input system that leverages previous experience with physical QWERTY keyboards, by supporting two-handed interaction through multitouch exploration and spatial, simultaneous audio feedback. We conducted a user study, with 30 novice touchscreen participants entering text under one of two conditions: (1) SpatialTouch or (2) mainstream accessibility method Explore by Touch. We show that SpatialTouch enables blind users to leverage previous experience as they do a better use of home keys and perform more efficient exploration paths. Results suggest that although SpatialTouch did not result in faster input rates overall, it was indeed able to leverage previous QWERTY experience in contrast to Explore by Touch.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "University of Lisbon", "University of Dundee", "University of Lisbon", "Rochester Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jo\u00e3o Guerreiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerreiro:Jo=atilde=o", "Andr\u00e9 Rodrigues.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodrigues_0002:Andr=eacute=", "Kyle Montague.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montague:Kyle", "Tiago Jo\u00e3o Vieira Guerreiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerreiro:Tiago_Jo=atilde=o_Vieira", "Hugo Nicolau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nicolau:Hugo", "Daniel Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves_0002:Daniel"], "pages": 4}
