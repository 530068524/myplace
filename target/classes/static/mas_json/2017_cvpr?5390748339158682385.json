A typical approach to data association involves finding a graph matching or network flow that minimizes a sum of pairwise association costs, which are often either hand-crafted or learned as linear functions of fixed features. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn features for network-flow-based data association via backpropagation, by expressing the optimum of a smoothed network flow problem as a differentiable function of the pairwise association costs. We apply this approach to multi-object tracking with a network flow formulation. Our experiments demonstrate that we are able to successfully learn all cost functions for the association problem in an end-to-end fashion, which outperform hand-crafted costs in all settings. The integration and combination of various sources of inputs becomes easy and the cost functions can be learned entirely from data, alleviating tedious hand-designing of costs.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Princeton University", "University of Michigan", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Samuel Schulter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schulter:Samuel", "Paul Vernaza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vernaza:Paul", "Wongun Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Wongun", "Manmohan Chandraker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandraker:Manmohan"], "pages": 10}
