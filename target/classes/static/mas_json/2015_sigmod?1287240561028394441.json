{"title": "SEMROD: Secure and Efficient MapReduce Over HybriD Clouds.", "fields": ["scheduling", "exploit", "data processing", "computation", "key"], "abstract": "This paper describes SEMROD, a sensitive data aware MapReduce (MR) framework for hybrid clouds. SEMROD steers data and computation through public and private machines in such a way that no knowledge about sensitive data is leaked to public machines. For this purpose, SEMROD keeps trace of intermediate keys (generated during MR execution) that become sensitive, based on which it makes dynamic task scheduling decisions. SEMROD guarantees that adversaries  viz.  public machines) cannot gain any ``additional'' information about sensitive data from either the data stored on public machines or the communication between public and private machines during job execution. SEMROD extends naturally from a single MR job to multi-phase MR jobs that result, for instance, from compiling Hive queries into MR jobs. Using SEMROD, computation that may involve sensitive data can exploit public machines, thereby bringing significant performance benefits. Such computation would otherwise be restricted to only private clouds. Our experiments clearly demonstrate performance advantages to using SEMROD as compared with other secure alternatives, even when the percentage of sensitive data is as high as 50%.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of C ...
