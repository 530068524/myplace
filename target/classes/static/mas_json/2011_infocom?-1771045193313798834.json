Part of the challenge is due to the inherent dependencies between VMs comprising a multi-tier application, which introduce complex load interactions between the underlying physical servers. For example, simply moving an overloaded VM to a (random) underloaded physical machine can inadvertently overload the network. We introduce AppAware\u2014a novel, computationally efficient scheme for incorporating (1) inter-VM dependencies and (2) the underlying network topology into VM migration decisions. Using simulations, we show that our proposed method decreases network traffic by up to 81%compared to a well known alternative VM migration method that is not application-aware.", "citation": "Citations (218)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Vivek Shrivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrivastava:Vivek", "Petros Zerfos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zerfos:Petros", "Kang-Won Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kang=Won", "Hani Jamjoom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jamjoom:Hani", "Yew-Huey Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yew=Huey", "Suman Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Suman"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
