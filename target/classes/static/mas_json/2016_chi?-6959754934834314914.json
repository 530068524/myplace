{"title": "Can Eye Help You?: Effects of Visualizing Eye Fixations on Remote Collaboration Scenarios for Physical Tasks.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "gesture", "pointer", "projector", "workspace"], "abstract": "In this work, we investigate how remote collaboration between a local worker and a remote collaborator will change if eye fixations of the collaborator are presented to the worker. We track the collaborator's points of gaze on a monitor screen displaying a physical workspace and visualize them onto the space by a projector or through an optical see-through head-mounted display. Through a series of user studies, we have found the followings: 1) Eye fixations can serve as a fast and precise pointer to objects of the collaborator's interest. 2) Eyes and other modalities, such as hand gestures and speech, are used differently for object identification and manipulation. 3) Eyes are used for explicit instructions only when they are combined with speech. 4) The worker can predict some intentions of the collaborator such as his/her current interest and next instruction.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Keita Higuchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Higuchi:Keita", "Ryo Yonetani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yonetani:Ryo", "Yoichi Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Yoichi"], "pages": 11}
