{"title": "Older adults as digital content producers.", "fields": ["digital content", "computer science", "social engagement", "multimedia", "user generated content"], "abstract": "Older adults are normally characterized as consumers, rather than producers, of digital content. Current research concerning the design of technologies for older adults typically focuses on providing access to digital resources. Access is important, but is often insufficient, especially when establishing new social relationships. This paper investigates the nature and role of digital content that has been created by older adults, for the purpose of forging new relationships. We present a unique field study in which seven older adults (aged 71-92 years), who did not know each other, used a prototype iPad application ( Enmesh ) to create and share photographs and messages. The findings demonstrate that older adults, even those in the \\'1c\"oldest old\\'1d\" age group, embraced opportunities to express themselves creatively through digital content production. We show that self-expression and social engagement with peers can be realized when socio-technical systems are suitably designed to allow older adults to create and share their own digital content.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "Swinburne University of Technology", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Jenny Waycott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waycott:Jenny", "Frank Vetere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vetere:Frank", "Sonja Pedell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedell:Sonja", "Lars Kulik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulik:Lars", "Elizabeth Ozanne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ozanne:Elizabeth", "Alan Gruner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gruner:Alan", "John Downs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Downs:John"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
