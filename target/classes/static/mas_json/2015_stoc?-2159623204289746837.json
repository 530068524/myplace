All previous approaches obtained sub-optimal results and used resolve rules that looked only at the immediate children in the EIG ( Exponential Information Gathering ) tree. At the heart of our solution are new resolve rules that look at multiple layers of the EIG tree.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["VMware", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ittai Abraham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abraham:Ittai", "Danny Dolev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dolev:Danny"], "pages": 10}
