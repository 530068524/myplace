But for complicated architectures such as the x86, it is all too easy to get the details of the analysis wrong. We have built a new checker that is smaller, faster, and has a much reduced trusted computing base when compared to Google's original analysis. The key to our approach is automatically generating the bulk of the analysis from a declarative description which we relate to a formal model of a subset of the x86 instruction set architecture. The x86 model, developed in Coq, is of independent interest and should be usable for a wide range of machine-level verification tasks.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Lehigh University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Greg Morrisett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morrisett:Greg", "Gang Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Gang", "Joseph Tassarotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tassarotti:Joseph", "Jean-Baptiste Tristan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tristan:Jean=Baptiste", "Edward Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Edward"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
