The layout of KALQ was determined through first studying how users should grip a device with two hands. We then assigned letters to keys computationally, using a model of two-thumb tapping. KALQ minimizes thumb travel distance and maximizes alternation between thumbs. An error correction algorithm was added to help address linguistic and motor errors. Users reached a rate of 37 words per minute (with a 5% error rate) after a training program.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Antti Oulasvirta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oulasvirta:Antti", "Anna Reichel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reichel:Anna", "Wenbin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Wenbin", "Yan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Yan", "Myroslav Bachynskyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bachynskyi:Myroslav", "Keith Vertanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vertanen:Keith", "Per Ola Kristensson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kristensson:Per_Ola"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
