Square object localization is category scalable. By using a binary search strategy, the number of scales to test is further reduced empirically to only O(log(min{H, W})) rounds of sliding CNNs, where H and W are respectively the image height and width. In the training phase, square CNN models and object co-presence priors are learned. In the testing phase, sliding CNN models are applied which produces a set of response maps that can be effectively filtered by the learned co-presence prior to output the final bounding boxes for localizing an object. We performed extensive experimental evaluation on the VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets to demonstrate that while efficient, square localization can output precise bounding boxes to improve the final detection result.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Cewu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Cewu", "Yongyi Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yongyi", "Hao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hao", "Chi-Keung Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Chi=Keung"], "pages": 9}
