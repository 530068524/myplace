It is challenging to design how to interact with these flying robots. We present a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) elicitation study that informs how to naturally interact with drones. Results show strong agreement between participants for many interaction techniques, as when gesturing for the drone to stop. We discovered that people interact with drones as with a person or a pet, using interpersonal gestures, such as beckoning the drone closer. We detail the interaction metaphors observed and offer design insights for human-drone interactions.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Jessica R.
