{"title": "GLS-SOD: a generalized local statistical approach for spatial outlier detection.", "fields": ["normal distribution", "gaussian random field", "robust statistics", "spatial analysis", "anomaly detection"], "abstract": "Local based approach is a major category of methods for spatial outlier detection ( SOD ). Currently, there is a lack of systematic analysis on the statistical properties of this framework. For example, most methods assume identical and independent normal distributions (i.i.d. normal) for the calculated local differences, but no justifications for this critical assumption have been presented. The methods' detection performance on geostatistic data with linear or nonlinear trend is also not well studied. In addition, there is a lack of theoretical connections and empirical comparisons between local and global based  SOD  approaches. This paper discusses all these fundamental issues under the proposed  G eneralized  L ocal  S tatistical ( GLS ) framework. Furthermore, robust estimation and outlier detection methods are designed for the new  GLS  model. Extensive simulations demonstrated that the  SOD  method based on the  GLS  model significantly outperformed all existing approaches when the spatial data exhibits a linear or nonlinear trend.", "citation": "Citations (38)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Feng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Feng", "Chang-Tien Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Chang=Tien", "Arnold P.
