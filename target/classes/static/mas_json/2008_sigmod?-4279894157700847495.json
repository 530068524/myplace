{"title": "UQBE: uncertain query by example for web service mashup.", "fields": ["query by example", "star schema", "tuple", "schema matching", "mashup"], "abstract": "The UQBE is a mashup tool for non-programmers that supports query-by-example (QBE) over a schema made up by the user without knowing the schema of the original sources. Based on automated schema matching with uncertainty, the UQBE system returns the best confident results. The system lets the user refine them interactively. A tuple in the query result is associated with  lineage  that is a boolean formula over schema matching decisions representing underlying conditions on which the corresponding tuple is included in the result. Given binary feedbacks on tuples by the user, which are possibly imprecise, the system solves it as an optimization problem to refine confidence values of matching decisions. The demo features graphical user interaction on the UQBE system, including querying and refinement.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jun'ichi Tatemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tatemura:Jun=ichi", "Songting Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Songting", "Fenglin Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Fenglin", "Oliver Po.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Po:Oliver", "K.
