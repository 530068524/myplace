The intent of the system is to play with little virtual fish. A player can interact with the virtual fish via Coral Display, an interactive device with multisensory physical feedback. When a player presents his or her hand above the device, fish bait appears on the palm, and the virtual fish come to eat it. The device provides the user with a feeling of spatial existence through illumination and vibration.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University"], "authors": ["Toshikazu Ohshima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohshima:Toshikazu", "Shun Kawaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawaguchi:Shun", "Yuma Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Yuma"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
