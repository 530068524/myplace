In a prediction game, a learner produces a predictive model while an adversary may alter the distribution of input data. We study single-shot prediction games in which the cost functions of learner and adversary are not necessarily antagonistic. We identify conditions under which the prediction game has a unique Nash equilibrium, and derive algorithms that will find the equilibrial prediction models. In a case study, we explore properties of Nash-equilibrial prediction models for email spam filtering empirically.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Michael Br\u00fcckner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Br=uuml=ckner:Michael", "Tobias Scheffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scheffer:Tobias"], "pages": 9}
