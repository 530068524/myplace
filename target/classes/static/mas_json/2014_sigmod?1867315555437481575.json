{"title": "OceanRT: real-time analytics over large temporal data.", "fields": ["analytics", "mobile network operator", "temporal database", "locality", "competitor analysis"], "abstract": "We demonstrate OceanRT, a novel cloud-based infrastructure that performs online analytics in real time, over large-scale temporal data such as call logs from a telecommunication company. Apart from proprietary systems for which few details have been revealed, most existing big-data analytics systems are built on top of an offline, MapReduce-style infrastructure, which inherently limits their efficiency. In contrast, OceanRT employs a novel computing architecture consisting of interconnected Access Query Engines (AQEs), as well as a new storage scheme that ensures data locality and fast access for temporal data. Our preliminary evaluation shows that OceanRT can be up to 10x faster than Impala [10], 12x faster than Shark [5], and 200x faster than Hive [13]. The demo will show how OceanRT manages a real call log dataset (around 5TB per day) from a large mobile network operator in China. Besides presenting the processing of a few preset queries, we also allow the audience to issue ad hoc HiveQL [13] queries, watch how OceanRT answers them, and compare the speed of OceanRT with its competitors.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Huawei", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Shiming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shiming", "Yin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yin", "Wei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Wei", "Liang Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Liang", "Mingxuan Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Mingxuan"], "pages": 4}
