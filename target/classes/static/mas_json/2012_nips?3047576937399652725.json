{"title": "An Integer Optimization Approach to Associative Classification.", "fields": ["predictive power", "interpretability", "associative property", "integer", "decision list"], "abstract": "We aim to design classifiers that have the interpretability of association rules yet have predictive power on par with the top machine learning algorithms for classification. We propose a novel mixed integer optimization (MIO) approach called Ordered Rules for Classification (ORC) for this task. Our method has two parts. The first part mines a particular frontier of solutions in the space of rules, and we show that this frontier contains the best rules according to a variety of interestingness measures. The second part learns an optimal ranking for the rules to build a decision list classifier that is simple and insightful. We report empirical evidence using several different datasets to demonstrate the performance of this method.1 2", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Allison Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Allison", "Dimitris Bertsimas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertsimas:Dimitris", "Cynthia Rudin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudin:Cynthia"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
