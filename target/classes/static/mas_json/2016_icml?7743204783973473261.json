We explain why versions of least-squares value iteration that use Boltzmann or e-greedy exploration can be highly inefficient, and we present computational results that demonstrate dramatic efficiency gains enjoyed by RLSVI. Further, we establish an upper bound on the expected regret of RLSVI that demonstrates nearoptimality in a tabula rasa learning context. More broadly, our results suggest that randomized value functions offer a promising approach to tackling a critical challenge in reinforcement learning: synthesizing efficient exploration and effective generalization.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ian Osband.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osband:Ian", "Benjamin Van Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Benjamin_Van", "Zheng Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Zheng"], "pages": 10}
