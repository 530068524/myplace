The class $\\A$ under consideration consists of all algorithms in a decision tree model where the tests involve only {\\em multilinear\\/}functions with a constant number of arguments. %To establish an instance-specific lower bound, we deviate from traditional Ben--Or-style proofs and adopt an interesting adversary argument. %For 2-d convex hulls, we prove that a version of the well known algorithm by Kirkpatrick and Seidel (1986) or Chan, Snoeyink, and Yap(1995) already attains this lower bound. For 3-d convex hulls, we propose a new algorithm. We further obtain instance-optimal results for a few other standard problems in computational geometry, such as maxima in 2-d and 3-d, orthogonal line segment intersection in 2-d, %finding bichromatic $L_\\infty$-close pairs in 2-d, off-line orthogonal range searching in 2-d, %off-line dominance reporting in 2-d and 3-d, off-line halfspace range reporting in 2-d and 3-d, and off-line point location in 2-d. The theory we develop also neatly reveals connections to entropy-dependent data structures, and yields as a byproduct new expected-case results, e.g., for on-line orthogonal range counting in 2-d.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "University of Waterloo", "Aarhus University", "University of Chile", "University of Waterloo", "Depto de Cienc. ...
