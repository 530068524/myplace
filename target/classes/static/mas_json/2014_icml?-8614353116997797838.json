{"title": "Signal recovery from Pooling Representations.", "fields": ["lipschitz continuity", "pooling", "inverse", "mnist database", "invertible matrix"], "abstract": "In this work we compute lower Lipschitz bounds of lp pooling operators for p = 1, 2, \u221e as well as lp pooling operators preceded by half-rectification layers. These give sufficient conditions for the design of invertible neural network layers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and image patches confirm that pooling layers can be inverted with phase recovery algorithms. Moreover, the regularity of the inverse pooling, controlled by the lower Lipschitz constant, is empirically verified with a nearest neighbor regression.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["New York University", "City College of New York", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Joan Bruna Estrach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Estrach:Joan_Bruna", "Arthur Szlam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szlam:Arthur", "Yann LeCun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/LeCun:Yann"], "pages": 9}
