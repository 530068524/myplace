{"title": "A Greedy Approach for Budgeted Maximum Inner Product Search.", "fields": ["deep learning", "matrix decomposition", "mathematical optimization", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is an important task in many machine learning applications such as the prediction phase of low-rank matrix factorization models and deep learning models. Recently, there has been substantial research on how to perform MIPS in sub-linear time, but most of the existing work does not have the flexibility to control the trade-off between search efficiency and search quality. In this paper, we study the important problem of MIPS with a computational budget. By carefully studying the problem structure of MIPS, we develop a novel Greedy-MIPS algorithm, which can handle budgeted MIPS by design. While simple and intuitive, Greedy-MIPS yields surprisingly superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. As a specific example, on a candidate set containing half a million vectors of dimension 200, Greedy-MIPS runs 200x faster than the naive approach while yielding search results with the top-5 precision greater than 75%.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "U Texas"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Hsiang-Fu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Hsiang=Fu", "Cho-Jui Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Cho=Jui", "Qi Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Qi", "Inderjit S.
