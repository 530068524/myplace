{"title": "Large-scale compute-intensive analysis via a combined in-situ and co-scheduling workflow approach.", "fields": ["file system", "workflow", "ranging", "big data", "gpu cluster"], "abstract": "Large-scale simulations can produce hundreds of terabytes to petabytes of data, complicating and limiting the efficiency of workflows. Traditionally, outputs are stored on the file system and analyzed in post-processing. With the rapidly increasing size and complexity of simulations, this approach faces an uncertain future. Trending techniques consist of performing the analysis  in-situ , utilizing the same resources as the simulation, and/or off-loading subsets of the data to a compute-intensive analysis system. We introduce an analysis framework developed for HACC, a cosmological N-body code, that uses both  in-situ  and co-scheduling approaches for handling petabyte-scale outputs. We compare different analysis set-ups ranging from purely off-line, to purely  in-situ  to  in-situ /co-scheduling. The analysis routines are implemented using the PISTON/VTK-m framework, allowing a single implementation of an algorithm that simultaneously targets a variety of GPU, multi-core, and many-core architectures.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Los Alamos National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Argonne National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Christopher M.
