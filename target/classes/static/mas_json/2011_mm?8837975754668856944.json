{"title": "2D geon based generic object recognition.", "fields": ["levenshtein distance", "cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition", "computer vision", "geon"], "abstract": "The Recognition by Components(RBC) is a theory in Psychology introduced by Biederman in the late 80s, by which humans perceive scenes through simple 3D objects with regular shapes such as spheres, cubes, cylinders, cones, or wedges, called Geons (geometric ions). Extracting geons from 2D images is a very challenging task as it requires a good segmentation and the recognition of the 3D geons in a 2D space. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for extracting 2D geons from 2D images. The process is composed of three major parts: image preprocessing which includes image background removal and segmentation, arc-geon detection, and polygon-geon detection. We also propose a general procedure for matching the extracted 2D geons to given models for object recognition. Experiment results show that our approach is competitive compared to existing object recognition methodologies in general.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["New Jersey Institute of Technology", "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "University of Burgundy", "University of Paris"], "authors": ["Xiangqian Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Xiangqian", "Vincent Oria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oria:Vincent", "Pierre Gouton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gouton:Pierre", "Genevi\u00e8ve Jomier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jomier:Genevi=egrave=ve"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
