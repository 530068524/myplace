Reliability of the service-oriented systems heavily depends on the remote Web services as well as the unpredictable Internet. Designing effective and accurate reliability prediction approaches for the service-oriented systems has become an important research issue. In this paper, we propose a collaborative reliability prediction approach, which employs the past failure data of other similar users to predict the Web service reliability for the current user, without requiring real-world Web service invocations. We also present a user-collaborative failure data sharing mechanism and a reliability composition model for the service-oriented systems. Large-scale real-world experiments are conducted and the experimental results show that our collaborative reliability prediction approach obtains better reliability prediction accuracy than other approaches.", "citation": "Citations (258)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Zibin Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Zibin", "Michael R.
