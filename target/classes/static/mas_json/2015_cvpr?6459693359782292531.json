A video deblurring method is proposed based on two observations: (i) camera motion within capture of each individual frame leads to motion blur; (ii) camera motion between frames yields inter-frame mis-alignment that can be exploited for blur removal. The proposed method effectively leverages the information distributed across multiple video frames due to camera motion, jointly estimating the motion between consecutive frames and blur within each frame. This joint analysis is crucial for achieving effective restoration by leveraging temporal information. Extensive experiments are carried out on synthetic data as well as real-world blurry videos. Comparisons with several state-of-the-art methods verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Duke University", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Haichao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haichao", "Jianchao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jianchao"], "pages": 9}
