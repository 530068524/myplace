One only need to consider size- s  degree- s  circuits that depend on the first log \u2218  c    s  variables (where  c  is a constant and we are composing  c  logarithms). Thus, hitting-set generator (hsg) manifests a  bootstrapping  behavior\u2014 a partial hsg against very few variables can be efficiently grown to a complete hsg. A boolean analog, or a pseudorandom generator property of this type, is unheard-of. Our idea is to use the partial hsg and its annihilator polynomial to efficiently bootstrap the hsg exponentially wrt variables. This is repeated  c  times in an efficient way.    Pushing the envelope further we show that:  (1)  a quadratic-time blackbox PIT for 6913-variate degree- s  size- s  polynomials, will lead to a \u201cnear\u201d-complete derandomization of PIT, and  (2)  a blackbox PIT for  n -variate degree- s  size- s  circuits in  s   n  \u03b4  -time, for \u03b4 s   n  -time is trivial).    Our second idea is to study depth-4 circuits that depend on constantly many variables. We show that a polynomial-time computable,  O ( s  1.49 )-degree hsg for  trivariate  depth-4 circuits bootstraps to a quasipolynomial time hsg for general poly-degree circuits, and implies a lower bound that is a bit stronger than Kabanets-Impagliazzo (STOC 2003).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Manindra Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Manindra", "Sumanta Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Sumanta", "Nitin Saxena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saxena_0001:Nitin"], "pages": 14}
