{"title": "Grid Pathfinding on the 2", "fields": ["autonomous agent", "recursive definition", "grid", "planner", "pathfinding"], "abstract": "Grid pathfinding, an old AI problem, is central for the development of navigation systems for autonomous agents. A surprising fact about the vast literature on this problem is that very limited neighborhoods have been studied. Indeed, only the 4- and 8-neighborhoods are usually considered, and rarely the 16-neighborhood. This paper describes three contributions that enable the construction of effective grid path planners for extended 2  k  -neighborhoods. First, we provide a simple recursive definition of the 2  k  -neighborhood in terms of the 2  k \u20131 -neighborhood. Second, we derive distance functions, for any  k  >1, which allow us to propose admissible heurisitics which are perfect for obstacle-free grids. Third, we describe a canonical ordering which allows us to implement a version of A* whose performance scales well when increasing  k . Our empirical evaluation shows that the heuristics we propose are superior to the Euclidean distance (ED) when regular A* is used. For grids beyond 64 the overhead of computing the heuristic yields decreased time performance compared to the ED. We found also that a configuration of our A*-based implementation, without canonical orders, is competitive with the \"any-angle\" path planner Theta$^*$ both in terms of solution quality and runtime.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["King's College London", "Andr\u00e9s Bello National University", "Pontifical Catholic University of Chile"], "authors": ["Nicolas Rivera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rivera:Nicolas", "Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hern=aacute=ndez:Carlos", "Jorge A.
