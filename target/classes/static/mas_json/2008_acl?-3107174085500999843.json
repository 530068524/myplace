{"title": "A Tree Sequence Alignment-based Tree-to-Tree Translation Model.", "fields": ["phrase", "syntax", "expressive power", "nist", "typology"], "abstract": "This paper presents a translation model that is based on tree sequence alignment, where a tree sequence refers to a single sequence of subtrees that covers a phrase. The model leverages on the strengths of both phrase-based and linguistically syntax-based method. It automatically learns aligned tree sequence pairs with mapping probabilities from word-aligned biparsed parallel texts. Compared with previous models, it not only captures non-syntactic phrases and discontinuous phrases with linguistically structured features, but also supports multi-level structure reordering of tree typology with larger span. This gives our model stronger expressive power than other reported models. Experimental results on the NIST MT-2005 Chinese-English translation task show that our method statistically significantly outperforms the baseline systems.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "National University of Singapore", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Min", "Hongfei Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Hongfei", "AiTi Aw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aw:AiTi", "Haizhou Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Haizhou", "Chew Lim Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chew_Lim", "Sheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Sheng"], "pages": 9}
