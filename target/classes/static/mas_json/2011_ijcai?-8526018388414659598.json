Yet since different algorithms may yield dramatically different outputs on the same data, the choice of algorithm is crucial. When selecting a clustering algorithm, users tend to focus on cost-related considerations (software purchasing costs, running times, etc). Differences concerning the output of the algorithms are not usually considered. Recently, a formal approach for selecting a clustering algorithm has been proposed [2]. The approach involves distilling abstract properties of the input-output behavior of different clustering paradigms and classifying algorithms based on these properties.\n\nIn this paper, we extend the approach in [2] into the hierarchical setting. The class of linkage-based algorithms is perhaps the most popular class of hierarchical algorithms. We identify two properties of hierarchical algorithms, and prove that linkage-based algorithms are the only ones that satisfy both of these properties.\n\nOur characterization clearly delineates the difference between linkage-based algorithms and other hierarchical algorithms. We formulate an intuitive notion of locality of a hierarchical algorithm that distinguishes between linkage-based and \"global\" hierarchical algorithms like bisecting k-means, and prove that popular divisive hierarchical algorithms produce clusterings that cannot be produced by any linkage-based algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Margareta Ackerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ackerman:Margareta", "Shai Ben-David.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=David:Shai"], "pages": 6}
