Existing public display systems almost always feature a single point of control that is responsible for scheduling content for presentation on the network and provide sophisticated mechanisms for controlling play-out timing and relative ordering. Our experiences suggest that such complex feature-sets are unnecessary in many cases and may be counter productive in signage systems. We describe an alternative, simpler paradigm for encouraging widespread use of signage systems based on shared 'content channels' between content providers and display owners. Our system has been in continuous use for approximately 3 years. We reflect and draw lessons from how our user community has adopted and used the resulting public display network. We believe that these reflections will be of benefit to future developers of ubiquitous display networks.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Sarah Clinch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clinch:Sarah", "Nigel Davies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davies:Nigel", "Adrian Friday.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friday:Adrian", "Christos Efstratiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efstratiou:Christos"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
