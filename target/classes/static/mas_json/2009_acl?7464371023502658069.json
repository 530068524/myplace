In this paper, based on the observation that bilingual data in many web pages appear collectively following similar patterns, an adaptive pattern-based bilingual data mining method is proposed. Specifically, given a web page, the method contains four steps: 1) preprocessing: parse the web page into a DOM tree and segment the inner text of each node into snippets; 2) seed mining: identify potential translation pairs (seeds) using a word based alignment model which takes both translation and transliteration into consideration; 3) pattern learning: learn generalized patterns with the identified seeds; 4) pattern based mining: extract all bilingual data in the page using the learned patterns. Our experiments on Chinese web pages produced more than 7.5 million pairs of bilingual sentences and more than 5 million pairs of bilingual terms, both with over 80% accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Chongqing University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Chongqing University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Long Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Long", "Shiquan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shiquan", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Ming", "Xiaohua Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaohua", "Qingsheng Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Qingsheng"], "pages": 9}
