{"title": "Unsupervised Transformation Learning via Convex Relaxations.", "fields": ["regular polygon", "handwriting", "linear map", "linear combination", "training set"], "abstract": "Our goal is to extract meaningful transformations from raw images, such as varying the thickness of lines in handwriting or the lighting in a portrait. We propose an unsupervised approach to learn such transformations by attempting to reconstruct an image from a linear combination of transformations of its nearest neighbors. On handwritten digits and celebrity portraits, we show that even with linear transformations, our method generates visually high-quality modified images. Moreover, since our method is semiparametric and does not model the data distribution, the learned transformations extrapolate off the training data and can be applied to new types of images.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tatsunori B.
