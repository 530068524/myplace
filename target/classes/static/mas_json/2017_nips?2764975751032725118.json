{"title": "Revisiting Perceptron: Efficient and Label-Optimal Learning of Halfspaces.", "fields": ["homogeneous", "bounded function", "uniform distribution", "perceptron", "unit sphere"], "abstract": "It has been a long-standing problem to efficiently learn a halfspace using as few labels as possible in the presence of noise. In this work, we propose an efficient Perceptron-based algorithm for actively learning homogeneous halfspaces under the uniform distribution over the unit sphere. Under the bounded noise condition~\\cite{MN06}, where each label is flipped with probability at most $\\eta < \\frac 1 2$, our algorithm achieves a near-optimal label complexity of $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d}{(1-2\\eta)^2}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ in time $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d^2}{\\epsilon(1-2\\eta)^3}\\right)$. Under the adversarial noise condition~\\cite{ABL14, KLS09, KKMS08}, where at most a $\\tilde \\Omega(\\epsilon)$ fraction of labels can be flipped, our algorithm achieves a near-optimal label complexity of $\\tilde{O}\\left(d\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ in time $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d^2}{\\epsilon}\\right)$. Furthermore, we show that our active learning algorithm can be converted to an efficient passive learning algorithm that has near-optimal sample complexities with respect to $\\epsilon$ and $d$.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Songbai Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Songbai", "Chicheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chicheng"], "pages": 11}
