In particular, we develop a content-based categorization of the type of messages posted by Twitter users, based on which we examine users' activity. Our analysis shows two common types of user behavior in terms of the content of the posted messages, and exposes differences between users in respect to these activities.", "citation": "Citations (911)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Mor Naaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naaman:Mor", "Jeffrey Boase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boase:Jeffrey", "Chih-Hui Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Chih=Hui"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
