Yet, it remains a daunting task to accurately know the cross-layer dependency a prior. In this paper, we address the problem of inferring the missing cross-layer dependencies on multi-layered networks. The key idea behind our method is to view it as a collective collaborative filtering problem. By formulating the problem into a regularized optimization model, we propose an effective algorithm to find the local optima with linear complexity. Furthermore, we derive an online algorithm to accommodate newly arrived nodes, whose complexity is just linear wrt the size of the neighborhood of the new node. We perform extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed methods.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "City University of New York", "Arizona State University", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Chen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0022:Chen", "Hanghang Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Hanghang", "Lei Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Lei", "Lei Ying.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ying:Lei", "Qing He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Qing"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
