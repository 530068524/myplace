A significant side effect has been the use of social tagging sites as navigational signposts for interesting content. The collective behavior of users who tagged contents seems to offer a good basis for exploratory search interfaces, even for users who are not using social bookmarking sites. In this paper, we present the design of a tag-based exploratory system and detail an experiment in understanding its effectiveness. The tag-based search system allows users to utilize relevance feedback on tags to indicate their interest in various topics, enabling rapid exploration of the topic space. The experiment shows that the system seems to provide a kind of scaffold for users to learn new topics.", "citation": "Citations (118)", "departments": ["Media Research Center", "PARC", "PARC", "PARC"], "authors": ["Yvonne Kammerer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kammerer:Yvonne", "Rowan Nairn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nairn:Rowan", "Peter Pirolli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pirolli:Peter", "Ed Huai-hsin Chi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chi:Ed_Huai=hsin"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
