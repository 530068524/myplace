This challenging, multi-faceted task is recently gaining a growing attention, especially due to its many potential applications. One particularly important aspect of argumentation mining is claim identification. Most of the current approaches are engineered to address specific domains. However, argumentative sentences are often characterized by common rhetorical structures, independently of the domain. We thus propose a method that exploits structured parsing information to detect claims without resorting to contextual information, and yet achieve a performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods that heavily rely on the context.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["DISI, Universit ... udi di Bologna", "DISI, Universit ... udi di Bologna"], "authors": ["Marco Lippi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lippi_0001:Marco", "Paolo Torroni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torroni:Paolo"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
