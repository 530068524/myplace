However, existing hairstyle datasets, such as the Beauty e-Expert dataset, are too small for developing and evaluating computer vision models, especially the recent deep generative models such as generative adversarial network (GAN). In this paper, we contribute a new large-scale hairstyle dataset called Hairstyle30k, which is composed of 30k images containing 64 different types of hairstyles. To enable automated generating and modifying hairstyles in images, we also propose a novel GAN model termed Hairstyle GAN (H-GAN) which can be learned efficiently. Extensive experiments on the new dataset as well as existing benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed H-GAN model", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Queen Mary University of London"], "authors": ["Weidong Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Weidong", "Yanwei Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Yanwei", "Yiqing Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Yiqing", "Yu-Gang Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yu=Gang", "Tao Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Tao", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
