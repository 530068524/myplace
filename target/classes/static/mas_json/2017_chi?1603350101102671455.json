{"title": "Can I Think of Something Else when Using a BCI?: Cognitive Demand of an SSVEP-based BCI.", "fields": ["cognition", "cognitive resource theory", "workload", "brain computer interface", "cognitive load"], "abstract": "BCIs are presumably supposed to require the full attention of their users and to lose accuracy if they pay attention to another task. This assertion has been verified with several BCI paradigms (e.g. P300). But the cognitive demand of the promising SSVEP paradigm had never been specifically assessed yet. We measured the accuracy of an SSVEP-based BCI used by 26 participants in various conditions of mental workload. Our analysis revealed that surprisingly, for this type of BCI, little attention is actually needed from participants to reach optimal accuracy: participants were able to successfully perform a complex secondary task (N-back) without degrading the BCI accuracy. The same observation was made whether visual or auditive attention was solicited. These results indicate that SSVEP is a low-demanding paradigm in terms of cognitive resources, and are encouraging for its use in complex interaction settings.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Rennes", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Lille University of Science and Technology", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["And\u00e9ol \u00c9vain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Eacute=vain:And=eacute=ol", "Ferran Argelaguet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Argelaguet:Ferran", "Nicolas Roussel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roussel:Nicolas", "G\u00e9ry Casiez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casiez:G=eacute=ry", "Anatole L\u00e9cuyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=eacute=cuyer:Anatole"], "pages": 6}
