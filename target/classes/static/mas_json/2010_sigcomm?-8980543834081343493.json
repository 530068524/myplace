We analyze more than 200 Exabytes of commercial Internet traffic over a two year period through the instrumentation of 110 large and geographically diverse cable operators, international transit backbones, regional networks and content providers. Our analysis shows significant changes in inter-AS traffic patterns and an evolution of provider peering strategies. Specifically, we find the majority of inter-domain traffic by volume now flows directly between large content providers, data center / CDNs and consumer networks. We also show significant changes in Internet application usage, including a global decline of P2P and a significant rise in video traffic. We conclude with estimates of the current size of the Internet by inter-domain traffic volume and rate of annualized inter-domain traffic growth.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Arbor Networks", "Arbor Networks", "Arbor Networks", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "AT&T Labs", "NIKSUN, Inc.", "Technical University of Berlin", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Southern Illinois University Edwardsville", "AT&T", "AT&T", "AT&T", "AT&T", "Orange S.A.", "University of Surrey", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Thales Research ... gy (TRT) UK Ltd"], "authors": ["Craig Labovitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Labovitz:Craig", "Scott Iekel-Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iekel=Johnson:Scott", "Danny McPherson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McPherson:Danny", "Jon Oberheide.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oberheide:Jon", "Farnam Jahanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jahanian:Farnam"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
