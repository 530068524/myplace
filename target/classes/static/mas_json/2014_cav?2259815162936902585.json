{"title": "Symbolic Visibly Pushdown Automata.", "fields": ["deterministic pushdown automaton", "nested word", "xml validation", "embedded pushdown automaton", "executable"], "abstract": "Nested words model data with both linear and hierarchical structure such as XML documents and program traces. A nested word is a sequence of positions together with a matching relation that connects open tags (calls) with the corresponding close tags (returns). Visibly Pushdown Automata are a restricted class of pushdown automata that process nested words, and have many appealing theoretical properties such as closure under Boolean operations and decidable equivalence. However, like any classical automata models, they are limited to finite alphabets. This limitation is restrictive for practical applications to both XML processing and program trace analysis, where values for individual symbols are usually drawn from an unbounded domain. With this motivation, we introduce Symbolic Visibly Pushdown Automata (SVPA) as an executable model for nested words over infinite alphabets. In this model, transitions are labeled with predicates over the input alphabet, analogous to symbolic automata processing strings over infinite alphabets. A key novelty of SVPAs is the use of binary predicates to model relations between open and close tags in a nested word. We show how SVPAs still enjoy the decidability and closure properties of Visibly Pushdown Automata. We use SVPAs to model XML validation policies and program properties that are not naturally expressible with previous formalisms and provide experimental results for our implementation.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Loris D'Antoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=Antoni:Loris", "Rajeev Alur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alur:Rajeev"], "pages": 17}
