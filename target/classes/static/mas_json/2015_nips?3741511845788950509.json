This concept was shown to be useful for dimensionality reduction. We present basic definitions with interesting counter-intuitions. We give theoretical propositions to show that space-time is a more powerful representation than Euclidean space. We apply this concept to manifold learning for preserving local information. Empirical results on non-metric datasets show that more information can be preserved in space-time.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Geneva", "University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland", "University of Geneva", "Expedia, Switzerland"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ke Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Ke", "Jun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0017:Jun", "Alexandros Kalousis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalousis:Alexandros", "St\u00e9phane Marchand-Maillet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marchand=Maillet:St=eacute=phane"], "pages": 9}
