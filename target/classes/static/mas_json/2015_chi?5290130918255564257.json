{"title": "Provenance for the People: An HCI Perspective on the W3C PROV Standard through an Online Game.", "fields": ["information age", "human computer interaction", "machine readable data", "provenance", "multimedia"], "abstract": "In the information age, tools for examining the validity of data are invaluable. Provenance is one such tool, and the PROV model proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium in 2013 offers a means of expressing provenance in a machine readable format. In this paper, we examine from a user's standpoint notions of provenance, the accessibility of the PROV model, and the general attitudes towards history and the verifiability of information in modern data society. We do this through the medium of an online-game designed to explore these issues and present the findings of the study along with a discussion of some of its implications.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Southampton", "University of Nottingham"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Khaled Bachour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bachour:Khaled", "Richard Wetzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wetzel:Richard", "Martin Flintham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flintham:Martin", "Trung Dong Huynh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huynh:Trung_Dong", "Tom Rodden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodden:Tom", "Luc Moreau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moreau_0001:Luc"], "pages": 10}
