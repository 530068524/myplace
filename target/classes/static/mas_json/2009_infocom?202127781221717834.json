Although a sensor node is likely to be equipped with only one antenna, it is possible to group several sensors to form a virtual MIMO link. Such grouping can be formed by means of clustering. In this paper, we propose a distributed MIMO-adaptive energy-efficient clustering/routing scheme, coined cooperative MIMO (CMIMO), which aims at reducing energy consumption in multi- hop WSNs. In CMIMO, each cluster has up to two cluster heads (CHs), which are responsible for routing traffic between clusters (i.e., inter-cluster communications). CMIMO has the ability to adapt the transmission mode and transmission power on a per-packet basis. The transmission mode can be one of four transmit/receive configurations: 1 times 1 (SISO), 2 times 1 (MISO), 1 times 2 (SIMO), and 2 times 2 (MIMO). We study the performance of CMIMO via simulations. Results indicate that our proposed scheme achieves a significant reduction in energy consumption, compared to non-adaptive clustered WSNs.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "departments": ["University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "Telcordia Technologies"], "authors": ["Mohammad Z.
