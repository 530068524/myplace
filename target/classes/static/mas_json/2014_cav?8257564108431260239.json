{"title": "String Constraints for Verification.", "fields": ["horn clause", "regular language", "correctness", "string", "decidability"], "abstract": "We present a decision procedure for a logic that combines (i)aword equations over string variables denoting words of arbitrary lengths, together with (ii)aconstraints on the length of words, and on (iii)athe regular languages to which words belong. Decidability of this general logic is still open. Our procedure is sound for the general logic, and a decision procedure for a particularly rich fragment that restricts the form in which word equations are written. In contrast to many existing procedures, our method does not make assumptions about the maximum length of words. We have developed a prototypical implementation of our decision procedure, and integrated it into a CEGAR-based model checker for the analysis of programs encoded as Horn clauses. Our tool is able to automatically establish the correctness of several programs that are beyond the reach of existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Uppsala University", "Academia Sinica", "Brno University of Technology", "Link\u00f6ping University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Parosh Aziz Abdulla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdulla:Parosh_Aziz", "Mohamed Faouzi Atig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atig:Mohamed_Faouzi", "Yu-Fang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yu=Fang", "Luk\u00e1s Hol\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hol=iacute=k:Luk=aacute=s", "Ahmed Rezine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rezine:Ahmed", "Philipp R\u00fcmmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=uuml=mmer:Philipp", "Jari Stenman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stenman:Jari"], "pages": 17}
