{"title": "Unidirectional Key Distribution Across Time and Space with Applications to RFID Security.", "fields": ["key distribution", "supply chain", "distributed computing", "computer network", "key management", "computer science", "spacetime", "communication source"], "abstract": "We explore the problem of secret-key distribution in unidirectional channels, those in which a sender transmits information blindly to a receiver. We consider two approaches: (1) Key sharing across space, i.e., via simultaneously emitted values that may follow different data paths and (2) Key sharing across time, i.e., in temporally staggered emissions. Our constructions are of general interest, treating, for instance, the basic problem of constructing highly compact secret shares. Our main motivating problem, however, is practical key management in RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) systems. We describe the application of our techniques to RFID-enabled supply chains and a prototype privacy-enhancing system.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "RSA Laboratories, Bedford, MA", "ThingMagic Inc, Cambridge, MA"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Ari Juels.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juels:Ari", "Ravikanth Pappu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pappu:Ravikanth", "Bryan Parno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parno:Bryan"], "pages": 16}
