We investigate the following decision problem: given two regular input languages of finite words, decide whether there exists a first-order definable separator. We prove that in order to answer this question, sufficient information can be extracted from semigroups recognizing the input languages, using a fixpoint computation. This yields an Exptime algorithm for checking first-order separability. Moreover, the correctness proof of this algorithm yields a stronger result, namely a description of a possible separator. Finally, we prove that this technique can be generalized to answer the same question for regular languages of infinite words.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["L'Abri", "L'Abri"], "authors": ["Thomas Place.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Place:Thomas", "Marc Zeitoun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeitoun:Marc"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
