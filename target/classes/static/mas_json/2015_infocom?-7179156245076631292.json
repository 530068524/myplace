In this paper we present WRH-ONoC, a novel wavelength-reused hierarchical architecture that is capable of interconnecting thousands of cores using a limited number of wavelengths while providing extremely high-throughput data communication between connected cores. In WRH-ONoC, the cores are divided into small subsystems that are interconnected using multiple \u03bb-routers and gateways in a hierarchical manner. Each \u03bb-router can provide non-blocking parallel communication among the directly connected cores or gateways, and all \u03bb-routers can reuse the limited number of available wavelengths. Communications between cores in different subsystems are routed via gateways in which optical signals can change their wavelengths via optical-electrical signal conversions. For a given number of cores, we give the minimum number of levels, \u03bb-routers, and gateways required to interconnect these cores, and derive the expected end-to-end data communication delay under the Uniform-Poisson traffic pattern. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that WRH-ONoC can achieve significant improvement on performance and reduction on hardware cost in comparison with the existing solutions.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Otago", "University of Otago", "University of Otago", "University of Otago", "Xidian University"], "authors": ["Feiyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Feiyang", "Haibo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Haibo", "Yawen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yawen", "Zhiyi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Zhiyi", "Huaxi Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Huaxi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
