{"title": "Improved testing of low rank matrices.", "fields": ["mean reciprocal rank", "low rank approximation", "small number", "rank"], "abstract": "We study the problem of determining if an input matrix  A  e R   m  x  n   can be well-approximated by a low rank matrix. Specifically, we study the problem of quickly estimating the rank or stable rank of  A , the latter often providing a more robust measure of the rank. Since we seek significantly sublinear time algorithms, we cast these problems in the property testing framework. In this framework,  A  either has low rank or stable rank, or is far from having this property. The algorithm should read only a small number of entries or rows of  A  and decide which case  A  is in with high probability. If neither case occurs, the output is allowed to be arbitrary. We consider two notions of being far: (1)  A  requires changing at least an e-fraction of its entries, or (2)  A  requires changing at least an e-fraction of its rows. We call the former the \"entry model\" and the latter the \"row model\". We show:   For testing if a matrix has rank at most  d  in the entry model, we improve the previous number of entries of  A  that need to be read from  O ( d  2 /e 2 ) (Krauthgamer and Sasson, SODA 2003) to  O (d 2 /e). Our algorithm is the first to  adaptively  query the entries of  A , which for constant  d  we show is necessary to achieve  O (1/e) queries. For the important case of  d  = 1 we also give a new non-adaptive algorithm, improving the previous  O (1/e 2 ) queries to  O (log 2 (1/e) / e).   For testing if a matrix has rank at most  d  in the row model, we prove an \u03a9( d /e) lower bound on the number of rows that need to be read, even for adaptive algorithms. Our lower bound matches a non-adaptive upper bound of Krauthgamer and Sasson.   For testing if a matrix has stable rank at most  d  in the row model or requires changing an e/ d -fraction of its rows in order to have stable rank at most  d , we prove that reading \u03b8( d /e 2 ) rows is necessary and sufficient.   We also give an empirical evaluation of our rank and stable rank algorithms on real and synthetic datasets.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Tsinghua University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Yi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0002:Yi", "Zhengyu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhengyu", "David P.
