Discriminatively trained convolutional neural networks, in particular, were recently shown to yield state-of-the-art performance in challenging image classification benchmarks such as ImageNet. However, elements of these architectures are similar to standard hand-crafted representations used in computer vision. In this paper, we explore the extent of this analogy, proposing a version of the state-of-the-art Fisher vector image encoding that can be stacked in multiple layers. This architecture significantly improves on standard Fisher vectors, and obtains competitive results with deep convolutional networks at a smaller computational learning cost. Our hybrid architecture allows us to assess how the performance of a conventional hand-crafted image classification pipeline changes with increased depth. We also show that convolutional networks and Fisher vector encodings are complementary in the sense that their combination further improves the accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (159)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Karen Simonyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simonyan:Karen", "Andrea Vedaldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vedaldi:Andrea", "Andrew Zisserman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zisserman:Andrew"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
