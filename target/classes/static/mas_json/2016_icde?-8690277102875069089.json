Fast top-k search in knowledge graphs is challenging as both graph traversal and similarity search are expensive. Conventional top-k graph search is typically based on threshold algorithm (TA), which can no long fit the demand in the new setting. This work proposes STAR, a top-k knowledge graph search framework. It has two components: (a) a fast top-k algorithm for star queries, and (b) an assembling algorithm for general graph queries. The assembling algorithm uses star query as a building block and iteratively sweeps the star match lists with a dynamically adjusted bound. For top-k star graph query where an edge can be matched to a path with bounded length d, we develop a message passing algorithm, achieving time complexity O(d2|E| + md) and space complexity linear to d|V| (assuming the size of Q and k is bounded by a constant), where m is the maximum node degree in G. STAR can further be leveraged to answer general graph queries by decomposing a query to multiple star queries and joining their results later. Learning-based techniques to optimize query decomposition are also developed. We experimentally verify that STAR is 5\u201310 times faster than the state-of-the-art TA-style graph search algorithm, and 10\u2013100 times faster than a belief propagation approach.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "Washington State University", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Shengqi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shengqi", "Fangqiu Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Fangqiu", "Yinghui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yinghui", "Xifeng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Xifeng"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
