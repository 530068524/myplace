{"title": "Parallel Materialisation of Datalog Programs in Centralised, Main-Memory RDF Systems.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "datalog", "workload", "rdf", "multi core processor"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach to parallel materialisation (i.e., fixpoint computation) of datalog programs in centralised, main-memory, multi-core RDF systems. Our approach comprises an algorithm that evenly distributes the workload to cores, and an RDF indexing data structure that supports efficient, 'mostly' lock-free parallel updates. Our empirical evaluation shows that our approach parallelises computation very well: with 16 physical cores, materialisation can be up to 13.9 times faster than with just one core.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Boris Motik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Motik:Boris", "Yavor Nenov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nenov:Yavor", "Robert Piro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piro:Robert", "Ian Horrocks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horrocks:Ian", "Dan Olteanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olteanu:Dan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
