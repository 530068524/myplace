{"title": "Rhizome: A Feature Modeling and Generation Platform.", "fields": ["software design", "modeling language", "software product line", "software maintenance", "object code"], "abstract": "Rhizome is an end-to-end feature modeling and code generation platform that includes a feature modeling language (FeatureML), a template language (MarkerML) and a template-based code generator. A software designer creates feature models using FeatureML by selecting and defining design choices. These design choices can be automatically associated with code templates and interpreted as parameter values for code generation. The code generator then replaces markers embedded in the code templates with dynamically generated code blocks to produce source code.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Guozheng Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Guozheng", "E.
