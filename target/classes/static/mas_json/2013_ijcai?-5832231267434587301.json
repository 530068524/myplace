{"title": "Sufficiency-Based Selection Strategy for MCTS.", "fields": ["computer go", "machine learning", "general game playing", "artificial intelligence", "game tree"], "abstract": "Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has proved a remarkably effective decision mechanism in many different game domains, including computer Go and general game playing (GGP). However, in GGP, where many disparate games are played, certain type of games have proved to be particularly problematic for MCTS. One of the problems are game trees with so-called optimistic moves, that is, bad moves that superficially look good but potentially require much simulation effort to prove otherwise. Such scenarios can be difficult to identify in real time and can lead to suboptimal or even harmful decisions. In this paper we investigate a selection strategy for MCTS to alleviate this problem. The strategy, called sufficiency threshold, concentrates simulation effort better for resolving potential optimistic move scenarios. The improved strategy is evaluated empirically in an n-arm-bandit test domain for highlighting its properties as well as in a state-of-the-art GGP agent to demonstrate its effectiveness in practice. The new strategy shows significant improvements in both domains.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Reykjav\u00edk University", "Reykjav\u00edk University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Stefan Freyr Gudmundsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gudmundsson:Stefan_Freyr", "Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bj=ouml=rnsson:Yngvi"], "pages": 7}
