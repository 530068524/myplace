For the first, we assume that all the peers are solving the same linear bandit problem, and prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal asymptotic regret rate of any centralised algorithm that can instantly communicate information between the peers. For the second, we assume that there are clusters of peers solving the same bandit problem within each cluster, and we prove that our algorithm discovers these clusters, while achieving the optimal asymptotic regret rate within each one. Through experiments on several real-world datasets, we demonstrate the performance of proposed algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Insubria"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Nathan Korda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korda:Nathan", "Bal\u00e1zs Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sz=ouml=r=eacute=nyi:Bal=aacute=zs", "Shuai Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shuai"], "pages": 9}
