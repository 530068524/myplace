Runtime error detection tools aid in the removal of these errors. We develop MUST as one such tool that provides a wide variety of automatic correctness checks. Its correctness checks can be run in a distributed mode, except for its deadlock detection. This limitation applies to a wide range of tools that either use centralized detection algorithms or a timeout approach. In order to provide scalable and distributed deadlock detection with detailed insight into deadlock situations, we propose a model for MPI blocking conditions that we use to formulate a distributed algorithm. This algorithm implements scalable MPI deadlock detection in MUST. Stress tests at up to 4,096 processes demonstrate the scalability of our approach. Finally, overhead results for a complex benchmark suite demonstrate an average runtime increase of 34% at 2,048 processes.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Dresden University of Technology", "RWTH Aachen University", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Tobias Hilbrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hilbrich:Tobias", "Bronis R. de Supinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Supinski:Bronis_R=_de", "Wolfgang E.
