An important problem that needs to be solved for these systems is how to choose the best set of indexes for a given workload. We have developed an XML Index Advisor that solves this XML index recommendation problem and is tightly coupled with the query optimizer of the database system. We have implemented our XML Index Advisor for DB2. In this demonstration we showcase the new query optimizer modes that we added to DB2, the index recommendation process, and the effectiveness of the recommended indexes.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "IBM", "University of Toronto", "IBM"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Iman Elghandour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elghandour:Iman", "Ashraf Aboulnaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aboulnaga:Ashraf", "Daniel C.
