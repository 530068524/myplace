Mobile assignments delivered to mobile journalists' smartphones are one potential future development step. We present findings on using mobile assignments from two exploratory user studies in which smartphones were used as news reporting tools. Mobile assignments were perceived as handy for fast reporting situations and simple stories but challenging in case of more complex tasks. Structured information content of assignments, process phase based information and supporting situation and activity awareness would support the work of both editorial staff and mobile journalists. The locationing of reporters for sending location-based assignments was found acceptable for coordinating the work although some privacy concerns were expressed. The findings provide new information on using mobile assignments in work where carrying out tasks involves creativity and the tasks may be complex, not strictly limited or they may not have clear completion criteria.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Tampere University of Technology", "University of Central Lancashire"], "authors": ["Heli V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4j\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/V=auml==auml=t=auml=j=auml=:Heli", "Paul Egglestone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egglestone:Paul"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
