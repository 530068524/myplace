{"title": "Tight query complexity lower bounds for PCA via finite sample deformed wigner law.", "fields": ["symmetric matrix", "random matrix", "orthonormal basis", "eigengap", "polynomial"], "abstract": "We prove a  query complexity  lower bound for approximating the top  r  dimensional eigenspace of a matrix. We consider an oracle model where, given a symmetric matrix  M  \u2208 \u211d  d  \u00d7  d  , an algorithm  Alg  is allowed to make  T  exact queries of the form  w  ( i )  =  M   v  ( i )  for  i  in {1,..., T }, where  v  ( i )  is drawn from a distribution which depends arbitrarily on the past queries and measurements { v  ( j ) , w  ( i ) } 1 \u2264  j  \u2264  i \u22121 . We show that for every  gap  \u2208 (0,1/2], there exists a distribution over matrices  M  for which 1)  gap   r  ( M ) = \u03a9( gap ) (where  gap   r  ( M ) is the normalized gap between the  r  and  r +1-st largest-magnitude eigenvector of  M ), and 2) any  Alg  which takes fewer than  const  \u00d7  r  log d /\u221a gap  queries fails (with overwhelming probability) to identity a matrix  V  \u2208 \u211d  d  \u00d7  r   with orthonormal columns for which \u27e8  V ,  M   V \u27e9 \u2265 (1 \u2212  const  \u00d7  gap )\u2211  i =1   r   \u03bb  i  ( M ). Our bound requires only that  d  is a small polynomial in 1/ gap  and  r , and matches the upper bounds of Musco and Musco \u201915. Moreover, it establishes a strict separation between convex optimization and \u201cstrict-saddle\u201d non-convex optimization of which PCA is a canonical example: in the former, first-order methods can have dimension-free iteration complexity, whereas in PCA, the iteration complexity of gradient-based methods must necessarily grow with the dimension.    Our argument proceeds via a reduction to estimating a rank- r  spike in a deformed Wigner model  M  = W  +  \u03bb   U   U  \u22a4 , where  W  is from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble,  U  is uniform on the  d  \u00d7  r -Stieffel manifold and  \u03bb  > 1 governs the size of the perturbation. Surprisingly, this ubiquitous random matrix model witnesses the worst-case rate for eigenspace approximation, and the \u2018accelerated\u2019  gap  \u22121/2  in the rate follows as a consequence of the correspendence between the asymptotic eigengap and the size of the perturbation  \u03bb , when  \u03bb  is near the \u201cphase transition\u201d  \u03bb  = 1. To verify that  d  need only be polynomial in  gap  \u22121  and  r , we prove a finite sample convergence theorem for top eigenvalues of a deformed Wigner matrix, which may be of independent interest. We then lower bound the above estimation problem with a novel technique based on Fano-style data-processing inequalities with truncated likelihoods; the technique generalizes the Bayes-risk lower bound of Chen et al. \u201916, and we believe it is particularly suited to lower bounds in adaptive settings like the one considered in this paper.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Max Simchowitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simchowitz:Max", "Ahmed El Alaoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alaoui:Ahmed_El", "Benjamin Recht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Recht:Benjamin"], "pages": 11}
