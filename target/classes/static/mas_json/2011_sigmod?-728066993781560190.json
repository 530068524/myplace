{"title": "A latency and fault-tolerance optimizer for online parallel query plans.", "fields": ["online aggregation", "web query classification", "query expansion", "sargable", "query plan"], "abstract": "We address the problem of making online, parallel query plans fault-tolerant: i.e., provide intra-query fault-tolerance without blocking. We develop an approach that not only achieves this goal but does so through the use of different fault-tolerance techniques at different operators within a query plan. Enabling each operator to use a different fault-tolerance strategy leads to a space of fault-tolerance plans amenable to cost-based optimization. We develop FTOpt, a cost-based fault-tolerance optimizer that automatically selects the best strategy for each operator in a query plan in a manner that minimizes the expected processing time with failures for the entire query. We implement our approach in a prototype parallel query-processing engine. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) there is no single best fault-tolerance strategy for all query plans, (2) often hybrid strategies that mix-and-match recovery techniques outperform any uniform strategy, and (3) our optimizer correctly identifies winning fault-tolerance configurations.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Prasang Upadhyaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Upadhyaya:Prasang", "YongChul Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:YongChul", "Magdalena Balazinska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balazinska:Magdalena"], "pages": 12}
