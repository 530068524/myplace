{"title": "Exploiting double opportunities for deadline based content propagation in wireless networks.", "fields": ["mobility model", "multicast", "throughput", "controller", "channel"], "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on mobile wireless networks comprising of a powerful communication center and a multitude of mobile users. We investigate the propagation of deadline-based content in the wireless network characterized by heterogeneous (time-varying and user-dependent) wireless channel conditions, heterogeneous user mobility, and where communication could occur in a hybrid format (e.g., directly from the central controller or by exchange with other mobiles in a peer-to-peer manner). We show that exploiting double opportunities, i.e., both time-varying channel conditions and mobility, can result in substantial performance gains. We develop a class of double opportunistic multicast schedulers and prove their optimality in terms of both utility and fairness under heterogeneous channel conditions and user mobility. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate that these algorithms can not only substantially boost the throughput of all users (e.g., by 50% to 150%), but also achieve different consideration of fairness among individual users and groups of users.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Han Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Han", "Irem Koprulu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koprulu:Irem", "Ness B.
