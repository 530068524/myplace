We present  EyeCVE , which uses mobile eye-trackers to drive the gaze of each participant's virtual avatar, thus supporting remote mutual eye-contact and awareness of others' gaze in a perceptually unfragmented shared virtual workspace. We detail trials in which participants took part in three-way conferences between remote CAVE\u2122 systems linked via  EyeCVE . Eye-tracking data was recorded and used to evaluate interaction, confirming the system's support for the use of gaze as a communicational and management resource in multiparty conversational scenarios. We point toward subsequent investigation of eye-tracking in ICVEs for enhanced remote social-interaction and analysis.", "citation": "Citations (40)", "departments": ["University College London", "University of Salford", "University of Reading", "University of Roehampton", "University of Roehampton"], "authors": ["William Steptoe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steptoe:William", "Robin Wolff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolff:Robin", "Alessio Murgia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murgia:Alessio", "Estefania Guimaraes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guimaraes:Estefania", "John Rae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rae:John", "Paul M.
