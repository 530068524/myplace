Instances of real-world LBS range from mapping services (e.g., Google Maps) to lifestyle recommendations (e.g., Yelp) to real-estate search (e.g., Redfin). In general, an LBS provides a public (often web-based) search interface over its backend database (of tuples with 2D geolocations), taking as input a 2D query point and returning k tuples in the database that are closest to the query point, where k is usually a small constant such as 20 or 50. Such a public interface is often called a k-Nearest-Neighbor, i.e., kNN, interface.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "George Washington University", "George Washington University", "George Washington University", "QCRI HBKUU"], "authors": ["Md Farhadur Rahman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahman:Md_Farhadur", "Weimo Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Weimo", "Saad Bin Suhaim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suhaim:Saad_Bin", "Saravanan Thirumuruganathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thirumuruganathan:Saravanan", "Nan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Nan", "Gautam Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das_0001:Gautam"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
