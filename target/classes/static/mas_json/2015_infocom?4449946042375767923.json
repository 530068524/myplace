The open wireless medium subjects DSA systems to unauthorized spectrum use by illegitimate users. This paper presents SpecGuard, the first crowdsourced spectrum misuse detection framework for DSA systems. In SpecGuard, a transmitter is required to embed a spectrum permit into its physical-layer signals, which can be decoded and verified by ubiquitous mobile users. We propose three novel schemes for embedding and detecting a spectrum permit at the physical layer. Detailed theoretical analyses, MATLAB simulations, and USRP experiments confirm that our schemes can achieve correct, low-intrusive, and fast spectrum misuse detection.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "University of Hawaii", "Arizona State University", "Google", "Yahoo!", "University of Delaware", "Arizona State University", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of S ... nology of China"], "authors": ["Xiaocong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xiaocong", "Jingchao Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jingchao", "Rui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Rui", "Yanchao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanchao", "Chi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Chi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
