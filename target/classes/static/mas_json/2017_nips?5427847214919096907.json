Currently, they are often characterized via intensity function which limits model's expressiveness due to unrealistic assumptions on its parametric form used in practice. Furthermore, they are learned via maximum likelihood approach which is prone to failure in multi-modal distributions of sequences. In this paper, we propose an intensity-free approach for point processes modeling that transforms nuisance processes to a target one. Furthermore, we train the model using a likelihood-free leveraging Wasserstein distance between point processes. Experiments on various synthetic and real-world data substantiate the superiority of the proposed point process model over conventional ones.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia State University", "IBM", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shuai Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Shuai", "Mehrdad Farajtabar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farajtabar:Mehrdad", "Xiaojing Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Xiaojing", "Junchi Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Junchi", "Xiaokang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiaokang", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan"], "pages": 10}
