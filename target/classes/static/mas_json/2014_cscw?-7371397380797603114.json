However, finding the many details needed for a non-trivial decision can be very labor-intensive. We present AskSheet, a general system that leverages human computation to acquire the inputs to an arbitrary decision spreadsheet provided by the user. The key innovation is the ability to prioritize the inputs by analyzing the user's spreadsheet formulas to calculate value of information for each of the blanks. By directing workers to find the details that impact the end result most, it results in a conclusive decision without gathering all of the inputs.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Alexander J.
