A common approach is to place thumbnail images of video keyframes in appropriate locations. Here we consider the challenge of determining which keyframes to select and where to place them on the map. Our proposed technique leverages sensor-collected meta-data which are automatically acquired as a continuous stream together with the video. Our approach is able to detect interesting regions and objects (hotspots) and their distances from the camera in a fully automated way. Meaningful keyframes are adaptively selected based on the popularity of the hotspots. Our experiments show very promising results and demonstrate excellent utility for the users.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Jia Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Jia", "Guanfeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Guanfeng", "Beomjoo Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Beomjoo", "Roger Zimmermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmermann:Roger"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
