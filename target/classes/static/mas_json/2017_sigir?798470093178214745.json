{"title": "Event Detection on Curated Tweet Streams.", "fields": ["social media", "exploit", "streams", "push technology", "intelligent agent"], "abstract": "We present a system for identifying interesting social media posts on Twitter and delivering them to users' mobile devices in real time as push notifications. In our problem formulation, users are interested in broad topics such as politics, sports, and entertainment: our system processes tweets in real time to identify relevant, novel, and salient content. There are three interesting aspects to our work: First, instead of attempting to tame the cacophony of unfiltered tweets, we exploit a smaller, but still sizeable, collection of curated tweet streams corresponding to the Twitter accounts of different media outlets. Second, we apply distant supervision to extract topic labels from curated streams that have a specific focus, which can then be leveraged to build high-quality topic classifiers essentially \"for free\". Finally, our system delivers content via Twitter direct messages, supporting  in situ  interactions modeled after conversations with intelligent agents. These ideas are demonstrated in an end-to-end working prototype.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Nimesh Ghelani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghelani:Nimesh", "Salman Mohammed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohammed:Salman", "Shine Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shine", "Jimmy Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Jimmy"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
