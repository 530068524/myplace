The result holds with high probability simultaneously at all points x in a general metric space X of unknown structure.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute", "Toyota Technological Institute"], "authors": ["Samory Kpotufe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kpotufe:Samory", "Vikas K.
