Thus, finite network lifetime is widely regarded as a fundamental performance bottleneck. Recent breakthrough in the area of wireless energy transfer offers the potential of removing such performance bottleneck, i.e., allowing a sensor network remain operational forever. In this paper, we investigate the operation of a sensor network under this new enabling energy transfer technology. We consider the scenario of a mobile charging vehicle periodically traveling inside the sensor network and charging each sensor node's battery wirelessly. We introduce the concept of renewable energy cycle and offer both necessary and sufficient conditions. We study an optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the ratio of the wireless charging vehicle (WCV)'s vacation time over the cycle time. For this problem, we prove that the optimal traveling path for the WCV is the shortest Hamiltonian cycle and provide a number of important properties. Subsequently, we develop a near-optimal solution and prove its performance guarantee.", "citation": "Citations (256)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Yi Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi_0001:Yi", "Liguang Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Liguang", "Y.
