{"title": "SCONE: Secure Linux Containers with Intel SGX.", "fields": ["asynchronous system", "hypervisor", "synchronization", "trusted computing base", "c standard library"], "abstract": "In multi-tenant environments, Linux containers managed by Docker or Kubernetes have a lower resource footprint, faster startup times, and higher I/O performance compared to virtual machines (VMs) on hypervisors. Yet their weaker isolation guarantees, enforced through software kernel mechanisms, make it easier for attackers to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of application data within containers.\n\nWe describe SCONE, a secure container mechanism for Docker that uses the SGX trusted execution support of Intel CPUs to protect container processes from outside attacks. The design of SCONE leads to (i) a small trusted computing base (TCB) and (ii) a low performance overhead: SCONE offers a secure C standard library interface that transparently encrypts/decrypts I/O data; to reduce the performance impact of thread synchronization and system calls within SGX enclaves, SCONE supports user-level threading and asynchronous system calls. Our evaluation shows that it protects unmodified applications with SGX, achieving 0.6\u00d7-1.2\u00d7 of native throughput.", "citation": "Citations (172)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Sergei Arnautov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arnautov:Sergei", "Bohdan Trach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trach:Bohdan", "Franz Gregor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gregor:Franz", "Thomas Knauth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knauth:Thomas", "Andr\u00e9 Martin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martin:Andr=eacute=", "Christian Priebe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Priebe:Christian", "Joshua Lind.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lind:Joshua", "Divya Muthukumaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muthukumaran:Divya", "Dan O'Keeffe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Keeffe:Dan", "Mark Stillwell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stillwell:Mark", "David Goltzsche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goltzsche:David", "David M.
