To this end we introduce a new scalable, alternation-based algorithm for co-segmentation, BiCoS, which is simpler than many of its predecessors, and yet has superior performance on standard benchmark image datasets.", "citation": "Citations (170)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yuning Chai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chai:Yuning", "Victor S.
