{"title": "ATraPos: Adaptive transaction processing on hardware Islands.", "fields": ["latency", "transaction processing", "multi core processor", "thread", "online transaction processing"], "abstract": "Nowadays, high-performance transaction processing applications increasingly run on multisocket multicore servers. Such architectures exhibit non-uniform memory access latency as well as non-uniform thread communication costs. Unfortunately, traditional shared-everything database management systems are designed for uniform inter-core communication speeds. This causes unpredictable access latencies in the critical path. While lack of data locality may be a minor nuisance on systems with fewer than 4 processors, it becomes a serious scalability limitation on larger systems due to accesses to centralized data structures.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Danica Porobic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Porobic:Danica", "Erietta Liarou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liarou:Erietta", "Pinar T\u00f6z\u00fcn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/T=ouml=z=uuml=n:Pinar", "Anastasia Ailamaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ailamaki:Anastasia"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
