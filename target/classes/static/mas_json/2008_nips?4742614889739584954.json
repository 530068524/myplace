It turns out that these bounds are asymptotically tight under mild assumptions on the data generating distribution. Finally, we briefly discuss a trade-off in epsilon between sparsity and accuracy if the SVM is used to estimate the conditional median.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Los Alamos National Laboratory", "University of Bayreuth"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ingo Steinwart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinwart:Ingo", "Andreas Christmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Christmann:Andreas"], "pages": 8}
