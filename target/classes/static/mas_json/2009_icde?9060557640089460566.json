{"title": "Exploring a Few Good Tuples from Text Databases.", "fields": ["information extraction", "knowledge acquisition", "text processing", "superkey", "tuple"], "abstract": "Information extraction from text databases is a useful paradigm to populate relational tables and unlock the considerable value hidden in plain-text documents. However, information extraction can be expensive, due to various complex text processing steps necessary in uncovering the hidden data. There are a large number of text databases available, and not every text database is necessarily relevant to every relation. Hence, it is important to be able to quickly explore the utility of running an extractor for a specific relation over a given text database before carrying out the expensive extraction task. In this paper, we present a novel exploration methodology of {\\em finding a few good tuples} for a relation that can be extracted from a database which allows for judging the relevance of the database for the relation. Specifically, we propose the notion of a good(k, $\\ell$) query as one that can return any $k$ tuples for a relation among the top-$\\ell$ fraction of tuples ranked by their aggregated confidence scores, provided by the extractor; if these tuples have high scores, the database can be determined as relevant to the relation. We formalize the access model for information extraction, and investigate efficient query processing algorithms for good(k, $\\ell$) queries, which do not rely on any prior knowledge about the extraction task or the database. We demonstrate the viability of our algorithms using a detailed experimental study with real text databases.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "AT&T Labs"], "authors": ["Alpa Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Alpa", "Divesh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Divesh"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
