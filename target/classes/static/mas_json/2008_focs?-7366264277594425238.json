Such routing algorithms have proven to be both simple to implement and heuristically effective when applied to wireless sensor networks. Greedy routing is a natural abstraction of this model in which nodes are assigned virtual coordinates in a metric space, and these coordinates are used to perform point-to-point routing. Here we resolve a conjecture of Papadimitriou and Ratajczak that every 3-connected planar graph admits a greedy embedding into the Euclidean plane. This immediately implies that all 3-connected graphs that exclude K 3.3  as a minor admit a greedy embedding into the Euclidean plane. Additionally, we provide the first non-trivial examples of graphs that admit no such embedding. These structural results provide efficiently verifiable certificates that a graph admits a greedy embedding or that a graph admits no greedy embedding into the Euclidean plane.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ankur Moitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moitra:Ankur", "Tom Leighton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leighton:Tom"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
