Partly due to its simplicity, Path ORAM is the most practical ORAM scheme for small client storage known to date. We formally prove that Path ORAM requires log^2 N / log X bandwidth overhead for block size B = X log N. For block sizes bigger than Omega(log^2 N), Path ORAM is asymptotically better than the best known ORAM scheme with small client storage. Due to its practicality, Path ORAM has been adopted in the design of secure processors since its proposal.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Connecticut", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Connecticut", "Cornell University", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Emil Stefanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stefanov:Emil", "Marten van Dijk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dijk:Marten_van", "Elaine Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Elaine", "Christopher W.
