In this paper, we present InkAnchor, a digital ink editor that allows users to easily create ink-based notes by finger drawing and writing on a mobile phone touchscreen. InkAnchor incorporates flexible anchoring, focus-plus-context input, content chunking, and lightweight editing mechanisms to support the capture of informal notes and annotations. We describe the design and evaluation of InkAnchor through a series of user studies, which revealed that the integrated support enabled by InkAnchor is a significant improvement over current mobile note taking applications on a range of mobile note-taking tasks.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Google", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yi Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Yi", "Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yang", "Edward Lank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lank:Edward"], "pages": 10}
