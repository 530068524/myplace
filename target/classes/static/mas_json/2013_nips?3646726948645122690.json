This paper observes that if the inference problem is \"smoothed\" through the addition of entropy terms, for fixed messages, the learning objective reduces to a traditional (non-structured) logistic regression problem with respect to parameters. In these logistic regression problems, each training example has a bias term determined by the current set of messages. Based on this insight, the structured energy function can be extended from linear factors to any function class where an \"oracle\" exists to minimize a logistic loss.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Australian National University"], "authors": ["Justin Domke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Domke:Justin"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
