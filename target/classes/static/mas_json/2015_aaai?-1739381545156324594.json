MatchMaps uses reasoning in qualitative spatial logic, description logic and truth maintenance techniques, to produce a consistent set of matches. We report the results of an initial evaluation of MatchMaps by experts from Ordnance Survey (Great Britain's National Mapping Authority). In both the case studies considered, MatchMaps was able to correctly match spatial objects (high precision and recall) with minimal human intervention.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Aberdeen", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Heshan Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Heshan", "Hai H.
