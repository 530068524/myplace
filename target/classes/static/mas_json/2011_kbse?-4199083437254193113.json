{"title": "SAUML: A tool for symbolic analysis of UML-RT models.", "fields": ["goal driven software development process", "software development", "use case points", "symbolic data analysis", "symbolic execution"], "abstract": "Model Driven Development (MDD) is an approach to software development built around the notion of models. One of its implementation is the IBM RSA RTE, which uses the UML-RT modeling language. In this paper we introduce the tool SAUML (Symbolic Analysis of UML-RT Models) that enhances the current practice of MDD with the analyses of UML-RT models. The implemented technique is based on symbolic execution, features modularity and supports the reuse of analysis results. The paper gives an overview of this technique and its implementation in the IBM RSA RTE tool.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Queen's University", "Queen's University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Karolina Zurowska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zurowska:Karolina", "J\u00fcrgen Dingel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dingel:J=uuml=rgen"], "pages": 4}
