The neural encoding of such distributions remains however highly controversial. Here we present a novel circuit model for representing multidimensional real-valued distributions using a spike based spatio-temporal code. Our model combines the computational advantages of the currently competing models for probabilistic codes and exhibits realistic neural responses along a variety of classic measures. Furthermore, the model highlights the challenges associated with interpreting neural activity in relation to behavioral uncertainty and points to alternative population-level approaches for the experimental validation of distributed representations.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Cristina Savin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savin:Cristina", "Sophie Den\u00e8ve.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Den=egrave=ve:Sophie"], "pages": 9}
