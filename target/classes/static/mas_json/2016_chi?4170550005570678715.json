{"title": "HapTurk: Crowdsourcing Affective Ratings of Vibrotactile Icons.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "user experience design", "communication design", "haptic technology", "modalities"], "abstract": "Vibrotactile (VT) display is becoming a standard component of informative user experience, where notifications and feedback must convey information eyes-free. However, effective design is hindered by incomplete understanding of relevant perceptual qualities, together with the need for user feedback to be accessed in-situ. To access evaluation streamlining now common in visual design, we introduce proxy modalities as a way to crowdsource VT sensations by reliably communicating high-level features through a crowd-accessible channel. We investigate two proxy modalities to represent a high-fidelity tactor: a new VT visualization, and low-fidelity vibratory translations playable on commodity smartphones. We translated 10 high-fidelity vibrations into both modalities, and in two user studies found that both proxy modalities can communicate affective features, and are consistent when deployed remotely over Mechanical Turk. We analyze fit of features to modalities, and suggest future improvements.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Oliver S.
