In this paper, it is shown that bounded deadline tardiness can be ensured for such applications on a multiprocessor with no utilization loss. This result is general: it is applicable to periodic, sporadic, and rate-based directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) models and allows sophisticated notions of precedence to be supported (particularly, notions allowed by the processing graph method). This paper is the first to show that bounded tardiness can be ensured for globally-scheduled DAG-based applications without utilization loss.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Cong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Cong", "James H.
