{"title": "Synergistic debug-repair of heap manipulations.", "fields": ["fault injection", "slicing", "programmer", "avl tree", "splay tree"], "abstract": "We present Wolverine, an integrated Debug-Repair environment for heap manipulating programs. Wolverine facilitates stepping through a concrete program execution, provides visualizations of the abstract program states (as box-and-arrow diagrams) and integrates a novel, proof-directed repair algorithm to synthesize repair patches. To provide a seamless environment, Wolverine supports \"hot-patching\" of the generated repair patches, enabling the programmer to continue the debug session without requiring an abort-compile-debug cycle. We also propose new debug-repair possibilities, \"specification refinement\" and \"specification slicing\" made possible by Wolverine. We evaluate our framework on 1600 buggy programs (generated using fault injection) on a variety of data-structures like singly, doubly and circular linked-lists, Binary Search Trees, AVL trees, Red-Black trees and Splay trees; Wolverine could repair all the buggy instances within reasonable time (less than 5 sec in most cases). We also evaluate Wolverine on 247 (buggy) student submissions; Wolverine could repair more than 80% of programs where the student had made a reasonable attempt.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur"], "authors": ["Sahil Verma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verma:Sahil", "Subhajit Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Subhajit"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
