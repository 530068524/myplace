We designed an interactive sound installation that supports kinesthetic awareness of a participant's micro-movements. The installation's interaction design uses continuous auditory feedback and leverages an adaptive mapping strategy, refining its sensitivity to increase sonic resolution at lower levels of movement activity. The installation uses field recordings as rich source materials to generate a sound environment that attunes to a participant's micro-movements. Through a qualitative study using a second-person interview technique, we gained nuanced insights into the participants' subjective experiences of the installation. These reveal consistent temporal patterns, as participants build on a gradual process of integration to increase the complexity and capacity of their kinesthetic awareness during interaction.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "University of Paris-Sud", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jules Fran\u00e7oise.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fran=ccedil=oise:Jules", "Yves Candau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Candau:Yves", "Sarah Fdili Alaoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alaoui:Sarah_Fdili", "Thecla Schiphorst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiphorst:Thecla"], "pages": 13}
