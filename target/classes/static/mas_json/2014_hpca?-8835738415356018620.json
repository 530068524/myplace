{"title": "A detailed GPU cache model based on reuse distance theory.", "fields": ["cache algorithms", "snoopy cache", "cache coloring", "cache oblivious algorithm", "smart cache"], "abstract": "As modern GPUs rely partly on their on-chip memories to counter the imminent off-chip memory wall, the efficient use of their caches has become important for performance and energy. However, optimising cache locality system-atically requires insight into and prediction of cache behaviour. On sequential processors, stack distance or reuse distance theory is a well-known means to model cache behaviour. However, it is not straightforward to apply this theory to GPUs, mainly because of the parallel execution model and fine-grained multi-threading. This work extends reuse distance to GPUs by modelling: 1) the GPU's hierarchy of threads, warps, threadblocks, and sets of active threads, 2) conditional and non-uniform latencies, 3) cache associativity, 4) miss-status holding-registers, and 5) warp divergence. We implement the model in C++ and extend the Ocelot GPU emulator to extract lists of memory addresses. We compare our model with measured cache miss rates for the Parboil and PolyBench/GPU benchmark suites, showing a mean absolute error of 6% and 8% for two cache configurations. We show that our model is faster and even more accurate compared to the GPGPU-Sim simulator.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "VU University Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Cedric Nugteren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nugteren:Cedric", "Gert-Jan van den Braak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braak:Gert=Jan_van_den", "Henk Corporaal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Corporaal:Henk", "Henri E.
