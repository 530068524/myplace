{"title": "On progressive network recovery after a major disruption.", "fields": ["heuristic", "network planning and design", "maintenance engineering", "flow network", "limited availability"], "abstract": "A major disruption may affect many network components and significantly lower the capacity of a network measured in terms of the maximum total flow among a set of source-destination pairs. Since only a subset of the failed components may be repaired at a time due to e.g., limited availability of repair resources, the network capacity can only be progressively increased over time by following a recovery process that involves multiple recovery stages. Different recovery processes will restore the failed components in different orders, and accordingly, result in different amount of network capacity increase after each stage. This paper aims to investigate how to optimally recover the network capacity progressively, or in other words, to determine the optimal recovery process, subject to limited available repair resources. We formulate the optimization problem, analyze its computational complexity, devise solution schemes, and conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the algorithms. The concept of progressive network recovery proposed in this paper represents a paradigm-shift in the field of resilient and survivable networking to handle large-scale failures, and will motivate a rich body of research in network design and other applications.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "University at Buffalo", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Jianping Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Jianping", "Chunming Qiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiao:Chunming", "Hongfang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Hongfang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
