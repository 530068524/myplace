This measure, called the randomized shortest-path (RSP) dissimilarity, depends on a parameter  \u03b8  and has the interesting property of reducing, on one end, to the standard shortest-path distance when  \u03b8  is large and, on the other end, to the commute-time (or resistance) distance when  \u03b8  is small (near zero). Intuitively, it corresponds to the expected cost incurred by a random walker in order to reach a destination node from a starting node while maintaining a constant entropy (related to  \u03b8 ) spread in the graph. The parameter  \u03b8  is therefore biasing gradually the simple random walk on the graph towards the shortest-path policy. By adopting a statistical physics approach and computing a sum over all the possible paths (discrete path integral), it is shown that the RSP dissimilarity from every node to a particular node of interest can be computed efficiently by solving two linear systems of  n  equations, where  n  is the number of nodes. On the other hand, the dissimilarity between every couple of nodes is obtained by inverting an  n  x  n  matrix. The proposed measure can be used for various graph mining tasks such as computing betweenness centrality, finding dense communities, etc, as shown in the experimental section.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Luh Yen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yen:Luh", "Marco Saerens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saerens:Marco", "Amin Mantrach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mantrach:Amin", "Masashi Shimbo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimbo:Masashi"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
