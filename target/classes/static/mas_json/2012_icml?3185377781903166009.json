Several key applications of LFMs need nonlinearities, which results in analytically intractable inference. In this work we show how non-linear LFMs can be represented as nonlinear white noise driven state-space models and present an efficient non-linear Kalman filtering and smoothing based method for approximate state and parameter inference. We illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology via two simulated examples, and apply it to a real-world problem of long-term prediction of GPS satellite orbits.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Tampere University of Technology", "Aalto University"], "authors": ["Jouni Hartikainen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartikainen:Jouni", "Mari Sepp\u00e4nen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sepp=auml=nen:Mari", "Simo S\u00e4rkk\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=auml=rkk=auml=:Simo"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
