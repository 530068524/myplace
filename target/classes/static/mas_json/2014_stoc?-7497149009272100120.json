The previously fastest construction algorithms that used  O ( n  log  \u03c3 ) bits of space took times  O ( n  log log  \u03c3 ) and  O ( n  log  e    n ) respectively (where  e  is any positive constant smaller than 1).", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Helsinki"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Djamal Belazzougui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belazzougui:Djamal"], "pages": 46}
