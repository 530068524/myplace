As the algorithm generates dependency trees for partial translations left-to-right in decoding, it allows for efficient integration of both n-gram and dependency language models. To resolve conflicts in shift-reduce parsing, we propose a maximum entropy model trained on the derivation graph of training data. As our approach combines the merits of phrase-based and string-todependency models, it achieves significant improvements over the two baselines on the NIST Chinese-English datasets.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Tsinghua University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Yang"], "pages": 10}
