{"title": "Nearly complete graphs decomposable into large induced matchings and their applications.", "fields": ["conjecture", "complete graph", "combinatorics", "cograph", "discrete mathematics", "disjoint sets", "disjoint union", "graph", "mathematics"], "abstract": "We describe two constructions of (very) dense graphs which are edge disjoint unions of large  induced  matchings. The first construction exhibits graphs on N vertices with ( N  2 )-o(N 2 ) edges, which can be decomposed into pairwise disjoint induced matchings, each of size N 1-o(1) . The second construction provides a covering of all edges of the complete graph K N  by two graphs, each being the edge disjoint union of at most N 2-\u03b4  induced matchings, where \u03b4>0.076. This disproves (in a strong form) a conjecture of Meshulam, substantially improves a result of Birk, Linial and Meshulam on communicating over a shared channel, and (slightly) extends the analysis of Hastad and Wigderson of the graph test of Samorodnitsky and Trevisan for linearity. Additionally, our constructions settle a combinatorial question of Vempala regarding a candidate rounding scheme for the directed Steiner tree problem.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Institute for Advanced Study", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Noga Alon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alon:Noga", "Ankur Moitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moitra:Ankur", "Benny Sudakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sudakov:Benny"], "pages": 12}
