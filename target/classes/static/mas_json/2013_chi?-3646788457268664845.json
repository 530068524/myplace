We investigated whether the classic think-aloud and a think-aloud with an explicit instruction leads to different task-solving performance compared to silent working. The results suggest that the classic method had no impact on task performance whereas the explicit instruction led to an increase in within-page and between-page navigation and scrolling activity. The classic method was linked to an increase in mental workload in terms of effort and frustration. The explicit think-aloud led to an increase in mental demand, performance, effort and frustration.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Sunderland", "University of York"], "authors": ["Sharon McDonald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McDonald:Sharon", "Helen Petrie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrie:Helen"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
