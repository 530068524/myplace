Uniqueness of Tensor Tucker Decompositions with Structured Sparsity.", "fields": ["observable", "feature learning", "topic model", "uniqueness", "probabilistic logic", "identifiability"], "abstract": "Overcomplete latent representations have been very popular for unsupervised feature learning in recent years. In this paper, we specify which overcomplete models can be identified given observable moments of a certain order. We consider probabilistic admixture or topic models in the overcomplete regime, where the number of latent topics can greatly exceed the size of the observed word vocabulary. While general overcomplete topic models are not identifiable, we establish generic identifiability under a constraint, referred to as topic persistence. Our sufficient conditions for identifiability involve a novel set of \"higher order\" expansion conditions on the topic-word matrix or the population structure of the model. This set of higher-order expansion conditions allow for overcomplete models, and require the existence of a perfect matching from latent topics to higher order observed words. We establish that random structured topic models are identifiable w.h.p. in the overcomplete regime. Our identifiability results allows for general (non-degenerate) distributions for modeling the topic proportions, and thus, we can handle arbitrarily correlated topics in our framework. Our identifiability results imply uniqueness of a class of tensor decompositions with structured sparsity which is contained in the class of Tucker decompositions, but is more general than the Candecomp/Parafac (CP) decomposition.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "Columbia University", "University of California, Irvine", "University of Washington", "University of California, Irvine", "Columbia University", "University of California, Irvine", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Anima Anandkumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anandkumar:Anima", "Daniel J.
