{"title": "Relative debugging for a highly parallel hybrid computer system.", "fields": ["porting", "coprocessor", "hybrid computer", "debugger", "algorithmic program debugging"], "abstract": "Relative debugging traces software errors by comparing two executions of a program concurrently - one code being a reference version and the other faulty. Relative debugging is particularly effective when code is migrated from one platform to another, and this is of significant interest for hybrid computer architectures containing CPUs accelerators or coprocessors. In this paper we extend relative debugging to support porting stencil computation on a hybrid computer. We describe a generic data model that allows programmers to examine the global state across different types of applications, including MPI/OpenMP, MPI/OpenACC, and UPC programs. We present case studies using a hybrid version of the `stellarator' particle simulation DELTA5D, on Titan at ORNL, and the UPC version of Shallow Water Equations on Crystal, an internal supercomputer of Cray. These case studies used up to 5,120 GPUs and 32,768 CPU cores to illustrate that the debugger is effective and practical.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Cray", "Cray", "Cray", "Cray", "University of Queensland"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Luiz De Rose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rose:Luiz_De", "Andrew Gontarek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gontarek:Andrew", "Aaron Vose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vose:Aaron", "Robert Moench.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moench:Robert", "David Abramson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abramson:David", "Minh Ngoc Dinh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinh:Minh_Ngoc", "Chao Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Chao"], "pages": 12}
