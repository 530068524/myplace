{"title": "Semantic 3D Reconstruction with Continuous Regularization and Ray Potentials Using a Visibility Consistency Constraint.", "fields": ["regularization", "machine learning", "visibility", "3d reconstruction", "critical point"], "abstract": "We propose an approach for dense semantic 3D reconstruction which uses a data term that is defined as potentials over viewing rays, combined with continuous surface area penalization. Our formulation is a convex relaxation which we augment with a crucial non-convex constraint that ensures exact handling of visibility. To tackle the non-convex minimization problem, we propose a majorizeminimize type strategy which converges to a critical point. We demonstrate the benefits of using the non-convex constraint experimentally. For the geometry-only case, we set a new state of the art on two datasets of the commonly used Middlebury multi-view stereo benchmark. Moreover, our general-purpose formulation directly reconstructs thin objects, which are usually treated with specialized algorithms. A qualitative evaluation on the dense semantic 3D reconstruction task shows that we improve significantly over previous methods.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Nikolay Savinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savinov:Nikolay", "Christian H\u00e4ne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=ne:Christian", "Lubor Ladicky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ladicky:Lubor", "Marc Pollefeys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pollefeys:Marc"], "pages": 10}
