{"title": "Assisting Users with Clustering Tasks by Combining Metric Learning and Classification.", "fields": ["correlation clustering", "consensus clustering", "clustering high dimensional data", "fuzzy clustering", "conceptual clustering"], "abstract": "Interactive clustering refers to situations in which a human labeler is willing to assist a learning algorithm in automatically clustering items. We present a related but somewhat different task, assisted clustering, in which a user creates explicit groups of items from a large set and wants suggestions on what items to add to each group. While the traditional approach to interactive clustering has been to use metric learning to induce a distance metric, our situation seems equally amenable to classification. Using clusterings of documents from human subjects, we found that one or the other method proved to be superior for a given cluster, but not uniformly so. We thus developed a hybrid mechanism for combining the metric learner and the classifier. We present results from a large number of trials based on human clusterings, in which we show that our combination scheme matches and often exceeds the performance of a method which exclusively uses either type of learner.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Sumit Basu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basu:Sumit", "Danyel Fisher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fisher:Danyel", "Steven M.
