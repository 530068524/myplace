{"title": "Two concurrent data structures for efficient datalog query processing.", "fields": ["datalog", "theoretical computer science", "syntax", "distributed computing", "concurrent data structure"], "abstract": "In recent years, Datalog has gained popularity for the implementation of advanced data analysis. Applications benefit from Datalog's high-level, declarative syntax, and availability of efficient algorithms for computing solutions. The efficiency of Datalog engines has reached a point where engines such as Souffle have reported performance results comparable to low-level hand-crafted alternatives [3].", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Innsbruck", "University of Sydney", "University College London"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Herbert Jordan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jordan:Herbert", "Bernhard Scholz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scholz:Bernhard", "Pavle Subotic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subotic:Pavle"], "pages": 2}
