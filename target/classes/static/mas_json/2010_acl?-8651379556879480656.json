To answer this question, we focus on two broad-coverage lexical resources of a different nature: WordNet, as a de-facto standard used in Word Sense Disambiguation experiments; and Wikipedia, as a large coverage, updated encyclopaedic resource which may have a better coverage of relevant senses in Web pages.\n\nOur results indicate that (i) Wikipedia has a much better coverage of search results, (ii) the distribution of senses in search results can be estimated using the internal graph structure of the Wikipedia and the relative number of visits received by each sense in Wikipedia, and (iii) associating Web pages to Wikipedia senses with simple and efficient algorithms, we can produce modified rankings that cover 70% more Wikipedia senses than the original search engine rankings.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National University of Distance Education", "National University of Distance Education", "National University of Distance Education"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Celina Santamar\u00eda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santamar=iacute=a:Celina", "Julio Gonzalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonzalo:Julio", "Javier Artiles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Artiles:Javier"], "pages": 10}
