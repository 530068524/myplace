{"title": "ClaimEval: Integrated and Flexible Framework for Claim Evaluation Using Credibility of Sources.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "web mining", "correctness", "baseline", "credibility"], "abstract": "The World Wide Web (WWW) has become a rapidly growing platform consisting of numerous sources which provide supporting or contradictory information about claims (e.g., \"Chicken meat is healthy\"). In order to decide whether a claim is true or false, one needs to analyze content of different sources of information on the Web, measure credibility of information sources, and aggregate all these information. This is a tedious process and the Web search engines address only part of the overall problem, viz., producing only a list of relevant sources. In this paper, we present ClaimEval, a novel and integrated approach which given a set of claims to validate, extracts a set of pro and con arguments from the Web information sources, and jointly estimates credibility of sources and correctness of claims. ClaimEval uses Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), resulting in a flexible and principled framework which makes it easy to state and incorporate different forms of prior-knowledge. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate ClaimEval's capability in determining validity of a set of claims, resulting in improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Indian Institute of Science", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Mehdi Samadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samadi:Mehdi", "Partha Pratim Talukdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talukdar:Partha_Pratim", "Manuela M.
