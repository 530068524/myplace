Previous works[11][2][10] have already showed the relationship between transmission delay and distance from source to destination. However, it still remains as an open question how transmission delay varies in accordance with node density. Answering this question can provide guidance for determining the number of nodes to meet the delay requirement when designing ad hoc networks. In this paper, we study the impact of node density \u03bb on the ratio of delay and distance, denoted by \u03b3(\u03bb). We analytically characterize the properties of \u03b3(\u03bb) as a function of \u03bb. And then we present upper and lower bounds to \u03b3(\u03bb). Next, we take propagation delay into consideration and obtain further results on the upper and lower bounds of \u03b3(\u03bb). Finally, we make simulations to verify our theoretical analysis.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of Science and Technology, Sana'a"], "authors": ["Shizhen Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shizhen", "Luoyi Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Luoyi", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing", "Qian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qian"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
