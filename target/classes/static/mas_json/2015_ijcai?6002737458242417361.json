Generating high-quality parallel test papers is challenging due to its NP-hardness in maximizing the collective objective functions. In this paper, we propose a Collective Biobjective Optimization (CBO) algorithm for solving k-TPG. CBO is a multi-step greedy-based approximation algorithm, which exploits the submodular property for biobjective optimization of k-TPG. Experiment results have shown that CBO has drastically outperformed the current techniques in terms of paper quality and runtime efficiency.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "University of Glasgow", "Data Analytics  ... rch, Singapore"], "authors": ["Minh Luan Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Minh_Luan", "Siu Cheung Hui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hui:Siu_Cheung", "Alvis Cheuk Ming Fong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fong:Alvis_Cheuk_Ming"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
