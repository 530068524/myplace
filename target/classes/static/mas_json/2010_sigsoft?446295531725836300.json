In particular, I focus on the problem of automatic generation of integration test cases from unit test cases. I start from the observation that software is usually provided with many unit test cases, and that unit test cases carry a lot of information about the unit execution that can be used to generate integration test cases. This paper illustrates the approach that I am investigating and that consists in capturing information in unit test cases with static analysis techniques to automatically merge unit test cases to produce useful integration test cases. The preliminary results reported in this paper provide evidence of the effectiveness of the approach. My current research is developing the approach further and producing additional experimental evidence. I expect to complete the research by defining a set of design for testability rules to produce software that facilitates the automatic generation of integration test cases.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Konstantin Rubinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubinov:Konstantin"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
