{"title": "Facial Expression Transfer with Input-Output Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machines.", "fields": ["exponential growth", "boltzmann machine", "restricted boltzmann machine", "inference", "facial expression"], "abstract": "We present a type of Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine that defines a probability distribution over an output sequence conditional on an input sequence. It shares the desirable properties of RBMs: efficient exact inference, an exponentially more expressive latent state than HMMs, and the ability to model nonlinear structure and dynamics. We apply our model to a challenging real-world graphics problem: facial expression transfer. Our results demonstrate improved performance over several baselines modeling high-dimensional 2D and 3D data.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "Disney Research", "Disney Research", "New York University"], "authors": ["Matthew D.
