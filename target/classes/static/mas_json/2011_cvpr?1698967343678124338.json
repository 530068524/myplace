The proposed framework exploits parametric dictionaries for sparse volumetric representations, l 1  dissimilarities and DC (Difference of Convex functions) decomposition. The SAD (sum of absolute differences) criterion is applied to the sparse representation of the reference volume and a DC decomposition of this criterion with respect to the transformation parameters is derived. This permits to employ a cutting plane algorithm for determining the optimal relative transformation parameters of the query volume. It further provides a guarantee for the global optimality of the obtained solution, which\u2013to the best of our knowledge\u2013is not offered by any other existing approach. A numerical validation demonstrates the effectiveness and the large potential of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Effrosini Kokiopoulou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kokiopoulou:Effrosini", "Daniel Kressner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kressner:Daniel", "Michail Zervos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zervos:Michail", "Nikos Paragios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paragios:Nikos"], "pages": 8}
