We apply the principles of social exchange and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to a qualitative study of Airbnb hosts to 1) describe activities that are facilitated by the peer-to-peer exchange platform and 2) how the assurance of the initial financial exchange facilitates additional social exchanges between hosts and guests. The study illustrates that the financial benefits of hosting do not necessarily crowd out intrinsic motivations for hosting but instead strengthen them and even act as a gateway to further social exchange and interpersonal interaction. We describe the assurance structures in networked peer-to-peer exchange, and explain how such assurances can reconcile contention between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. We conclude with implications for design and future research.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stockholm University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Airi Lampinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampinen:Airi", "Coye Cheshire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheshire:Coye"], "pages": 12}
