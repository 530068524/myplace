{"title": "Camouflaging an Object from Many Viewpoints.", "fields": ["cube", "viewpoints", "deep sky object", "perception", "distortion"], "abstract": "We address the problem of camouflaging a 3D object from the many viewpoints that one might see it from. Given photographs of an object's surroundings, we produce a surface texture that will make the object difficult for a human to detect. To do this, we introduce several background matching algorithms that attempt to make the object look like whatever is behind it. Of course, it is impossible to exactly match the background from every possible viewpoint. Thus our models are forced to make trade-offs between different perceptual factors, such as the conspicuousness of the occlusion boundaries and the amount of texture distortion. We use experiments with human subjects to evaluate the effectiveness of these models for the task of camouflaging a cube, finding that they significantly outperform naive strategies.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Virginia", "Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Flyby Media, USA"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Andrew Owens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Owens:Andrew", "Connelly Barnes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barnes:Connelly", "Alex Flint.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flint:Alex", "Hanumant Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Hanumant", "William T.
