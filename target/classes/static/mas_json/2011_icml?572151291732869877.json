We give efficient algorithms for calculating the continuous regularization path of solutions, and discuss relative advantages of the parameters. Our method experimentally gives state-of-the-art results similar to spectral clustering for non-convex clusters, and has the added benefit of learning a tree structure from the data.", "citation": "Citations (130)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Mines ParisTech", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Toby Hocking.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hocking:Toby", "Jean-Philippe Vert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vert:Jean=Philippe", "Francis R.
