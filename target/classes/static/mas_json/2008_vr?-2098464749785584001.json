The common spatial patterns were for the first time applied to EEG-based BCI system in CAVE with five-screen configuration. The interfacing system was based on two brain states of left and right hand phantom movements. It was suggested that the navigation could be demonstrated with no subject training in immersing virtual environment.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Junya Fujisawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujisawa:Junya", "Hideaki Touyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Touyama:Hideaki", "Michitaka Hirose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirose:Michitaka"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
