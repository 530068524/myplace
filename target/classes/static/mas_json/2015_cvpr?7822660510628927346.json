{"title": "Rolling shutter motion deblurring.", "fields": ["motion field", "scan line", "motion blur", "deblurring", "rolling shutter"], "abstract": "Although motion blur and rolling shutter deformations are closely coupled artifacts in images taken with CMOS image sensors, the two phenomena have so far mostly been treated separately, with deblurring algorithms being unable to handle rolling shutter wobble, and rolling shutter algorithms being incapable of dealing with motion blur. We propose an approach that delivers sharp and undistorted output given a single rolling shutter motion blurred image. The key to achieving this is a global modeling of the camera motion trajectory, which enables each scanline of the image to be deblurred with the corresponding motion segment. We show the results of the proposed framework through experiments on synthetic and real data.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shuochen Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Shuochen", "Wolfgang Heidrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heidrich:Wolfgang"], "pages": 9}
