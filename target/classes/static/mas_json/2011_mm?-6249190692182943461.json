During these sessions, users often want to share a printed document or other planar rectangular objects (a photograph, the whiteboard on the wall, etc.) with the other participants. If the object is simply held in front of the camera (or if the camera is turned towards the object), the object will undergo perspective distortion and a rectangular object will appear in the video as a quadrilateral. In addition, a handheld document will not be steady and it will be difficult for other users to read its contents. In this paper, we present an algorithm that uses real-time predictive keystone correction to automatically lock on to object and present it with the proper orientation and shape.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Alcatel-Lucent", "Alcatel-Lucent", "Alcatel-Lucent"], "authors": ["Senthil Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Senthil", "Sreedal Menon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menon:Sreedal", "Francis Zane.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zane:Francis"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
