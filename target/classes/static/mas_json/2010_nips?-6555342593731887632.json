{"title": "Constructing Skill Trees for Reinforcement Learning Agents from Demonstration Trajectories.", "fields": ["mobile manipulator", "trajectory", "abstraction", "reinforcement learning", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We introduce CST, an algorithm for constructing skill trees from demonstration trajectories in continuous reinforcement learning domains. CST uses a change-point detection method to segment each trajectory into a skill chain by detecting a change of appropriate abstraction, or that a segment is too complex to model as a single skill. The skill chains from each trajectory are then merged to form a skill tree. We demonstrate that CST constructs an appropriate skill tree that can be further refined through learning in a challenging continuous domain, and that it can be used to segment demonstration trajectories on a mobile manipulator into chains of skills where each skill is assigned an appropriate abstraction.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["George Konidaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konidaris:George", "Scott Kuindersma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuindersma:Scott", "Andrew G.
