Our proposed concept aligns layers of object-sized patches (nets) onto highly fragmented occlusion resistant line-segment midpoints (linelets) to encode regional information into efficient binary strings. These lightweight nets encourage discriminative object description through their high-spatial resolution, enabling highly precise encoding of the objects edges and internal texture-less information. BIND achieved various invariant properties such as rotation, scale and edge-polarity through its unique binary logical-operated encoding and matching techniques, while performing remarkably well in occlusion and clutter. Apart from yielding efficient computational performance, BIND also attained remarkable recognition rates surpassing recent state-of-the-art texture-less object detectors such as BORDER, BOLD and LINE2D.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jacob Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Jacob", "Jimmy Addison Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jimmy_Addison", "Qian Kemao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kemao:Qian"], "pages": 9}
