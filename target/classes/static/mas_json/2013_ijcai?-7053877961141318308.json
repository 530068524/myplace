A common approach is to combine a number of heuristics by maximizing over the values from each. If a limit is placed on this number, then a subset selection problem arises. We treat this as an optimization problem, and proceed by translating a natural loss function into a submodular and monotonic utility function under which greedy selection is guaranteed to be near-optimal. We then extend this approach with a sampling scheme that retains provable optimality. Our empirical results show large improvements over existing methods, and give new insight into building heuristics for directed domains.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Denver", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["D.
