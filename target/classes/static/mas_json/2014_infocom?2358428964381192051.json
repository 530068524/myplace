The increasing speed of the network links, together with the increased complexity of application protocol processing, require a new way of hardware acceleration. We propose a new concept of hardware acceleration for flexible flow-based application level traffic monitoring which we call Software Defined Monitoring. Application layer processing is performed by monitoring tasks implemented in the software in conjunction with a configurable hardware accelerator. The accelerator is a high-speed application-specific processor tailored to stateful flow processing. The software monitoring tasks control the level of detail retained by the hardware for each flow in such a way that the usable information is always retained, while the remaining data is processed by simpler methods. Flexibility of the concept is provided by a plugin-based design of both hardware and software, which ensures adaptability in the evolving world of network monitoring. Our high-speed implementation using FPGA acceleration board in a commodity server is able to perform a 100\u00a0Gb/s flow traffic measurement augmented by a selected application-level protocol analysis.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["CESNET", "CESNET", "Brno University of Technology", "CESNET", "CESNET", "CESNET", "Brno University of Technology", "Lule\u00e5 University of Technology"], "authors": ["Lukas Kekely.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kekely:Lukas", "Viktor Pus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pus:Viktor", "Jan Korenek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korenek:Jan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
