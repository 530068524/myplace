The simplest version assumes that the user is eating at a restaurant for which we know the menu. In this case, we can collect images offline to train a multi-label classifier. At run time, we apply the classifier (running on your phone) to predict which foods are present in your meal, and we lookup the corresponding nutritional facts. We apply this method to a new dataset of images from 23 different restaurants, using a CNN-based classifier, significantly outperforming previous work. The more challenging setting works outside of restaurants. In this case, we need to estimate the size of the foods, as well as their labels. This requires solving segmentation and depth / volume estimation from a single image. We present CNN-based approaches to these problems, with promising preliminary results.", "citation": "Citations (119)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Google", "Google"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Austin Myers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Myers:Austin", "Nick Johnston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnston:Nick", "Vivek Rathod.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rathod:Vivek", "Anoop Korattikara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korattikara:Anoop", "Alexander N.
