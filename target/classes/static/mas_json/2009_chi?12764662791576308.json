{"title": "GestureBar: improving the approachability of gesture-based interfaces.", "fields": ["gesture", "simulation", "ecological validity", "toolbar", "design elements and principles"], "abstract": "GestureBar is a novel, approachable UI for learning gestural interactions that enables a walk-up-and-use experience which is in the same class as standard menu and toolbar interfaces. GestureBar leverages the familiar, clean look of a common toolbar, but in place of executing commands, richly discloses how to execute commands with gestures, through animated images, detail tips and an out-of-document practice area. GestureBar's simple design is also general enough for use with any recognition technique and for integration with standard, non-gestural UI components. We evaluate GestureBar in a formal experiment showing that users can perform complex, ecologically valid tasks in a purely gestural system without training, introduction, or prior gesture experience when using GestureBar, discovering and learning a high percentage of the gestures needed to perform the tasks optimally, and significantly outperforming a state of the art crib sheet. The relative contribution of the major design elements of GestureBar is also explored. A second experiment shows that GestureBar is preferred to a basic crib sheet and two enhanced crib sheet variations.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "University of Central Florida", "Brown University", "University of Central Florida"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Andrew Bragdon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bragdon:Andrew", "Robert C.
