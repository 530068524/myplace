However, the large amount of data that traditional record-and-reply techniques record precludes its practical applicability to massively parallel applications. In this paper, we propose a new compression algorithm, Clock Delta Compression (CDC), for scalable record and replay of non-deterministic MPI applications. CDC defines a reference order of message receives based on a totally ordered relation using Lamport clocks, and only records the differences between this reference logical-clock order and an observed order. Our evaluation shows that CDC significantly reduces the record data size. For example, when we apply CDC to Monte Carlo particle transport Benchmark (MCB), which represents common non-deterministic communication patterns, CDC reduces the record size by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to traditional techniques and incurs between 13.1% and 25.5% of runtime overhead.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Kento Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Kento", "Dong H.
