Unlike previous methods, we neither assume the data are given in terms of distributions nor impose any parametric model on the within-cluster distribution. Instead, we utilize a non-parametric estimation of the average cluster entropies and search for a clustering that maximizes the estimated mutual information between data points and clusters. The improved performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several standard datasets.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University"], "authors": ["Lev Faivishevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faivishevsky:Lev", "Jacob Goldberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldberger:Jacob"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
