The core idea is to equip each original convolutional layer with another low-cost collaborative layer (LCCL), and the element-wise multiplication of the ReLU outputs of these two parallel layers produces the layer-wise output. The combined layer is potentially more discriminative than the original convolutional layer, and its inference is faster for two reasons: 1) the zero cells of the LCCL feature maps will remain zero after element-wise multiplication, and thus it is safe to skip the calculation of the corresponding high-cost convolution in the original convolutional layer, 2) LCCL is very fast if it is implemented as a 1*1 convolution or only a single filter shared by all channels. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ILSCRC-2012 benchmarks show that our proposed network structure can accelerate the inference process by 32% on average with negligible performance drop.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xuanyi Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Xuanyi", "Junshi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Junshi", "Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yi", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng"], "pages": 9}
