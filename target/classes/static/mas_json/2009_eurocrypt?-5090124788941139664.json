Our approach provides an efficient generic transformation from 1-universal to 2-universal hash proof systems. The transformation involves a randomness extractor based on a 4-wise independent hash function as the key derivation function. Our methodology can be instantiated with efficient schemes based on standard intractability assumptions such as Decisional Diffie-Hellman, Quadratic Residuosity, and Paillier's Decisional Composite Residuosity. Interestingly, our framework also allows to prove IND-CCA2 security of a hybrid version of 1991's Damgard's ElGamal public-key encryption scheme under the DDH assumption.", "citation": "Citations (411)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Columbia University", "Cryptology & In ... he Netherlands", "Cryptology & In ... he Netherlands"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Eike Kiltz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiltz:Eike", "Krzysztof Pietrzak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietrzak:Krzysztof", "Martijn Stam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stam:Martijn", "Moti Yung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yung:Moti"], "pages": 20}
