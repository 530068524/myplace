We developed and prototyped a future scenario with highly variable, real-time electricity prices due to a grid that mainly relies on renewables. We designed and deployed an agent-based interactive system that enables users to effectively operate the washing machine in this scenario. The system is used to book timeslots of washing machine use so that the agent can help to minimize the cost of a wash by charging a battery at times when electricity is cheap. We carried out a deployment in 10 households in order to uncover the socio-technical challenges around integrating new technologies into everyday routines. The findings reveal tensions that arise when deploying a rationalistic system to manage contingently and socially organized domestic practices. We discuss the trade-offs between utility and convenience inherent in smart grid applications; and illustrate how certain design choices position applications along this spectrum.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Southampton"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Enrico Costanza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costanza:Enrico", "Joel E.
