The generators are designed to learn the two-way conditional distributions between the two domains, while the discriminators implicitly define a ternary discriminative function, which is trained to distinguish real data pairs and two kinds of fake data pairs. The generators and discriminators are trained together using adversarial learning. Under mild assumptions, in theory the joint distributions characterized by the two generators concentrate to the data distribution. In experiments, three different kinds of domain pairs are considered, image-label, image-image and image-attribute pairs. Experiments on semi-supervised image classification, image-to-image translation and attribute-based image generation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zhe Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Zhe", "Liqun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Liqun", "Weiyao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Weiyao", "Yunchen Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Yunchen", "Yizhe Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yizhe", "Hao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0015:Hao", "Chunyuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chunyuan", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "pages": 10}
