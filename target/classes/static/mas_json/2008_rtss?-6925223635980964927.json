A sufficient schedulability test is presented and proved correct. It is shown that this test generalizes the previously-known exact uniprocessor, and sufficient identical multiprocessor, EDF- schedulability tests.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Univ.
