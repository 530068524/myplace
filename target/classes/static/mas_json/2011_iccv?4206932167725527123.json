Instead, we propose a variational formulation of scene flow relative to a coarse proxy geometry, which is better suited for many views. Furthermore, a linear basis is used to represent temporal surface flow, allowing for longer-range temporal correspondence with fewer variables. Our formulation takes known proxy motion into account (e.g, if the proxy is a tracked human subject), which enables 3D trajectory reconstruction when only a single view is available. Additionally, through the appropriate proxy and basis, our framework generalizes existing approaches for scene flow, optic-flow, and two-frame stereo. We illustrate results on real-data for both static and moving proxy surfaces over several frames.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Neil Birkbeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Birkbeck:Neil", "Dana Cobzas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cobzas:Dana", "Martin J\u00e4gersand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=auml=gersand:Martin"], "pages": 8}
