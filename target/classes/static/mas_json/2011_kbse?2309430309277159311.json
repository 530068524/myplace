For stakeholders of software, it is important to understand which requirements were tested, whether sufficiently, if at all. Hence tracing requirements in test-cases is an important problem. In this paper, we build on existing research and use features, realization of functional requirements in software [15], to automatically create requirements traceability links between requirements and test-cases. We evaluate our approach on a chat system, Apache Pool [21] and Apache Log4j [11]. We obtain precision/recall levels of more than 90%, an improvement upon currently existing Information Retrieval approaches when tested on the same case studies.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Celal Ziftci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Ziftci:Celal", "Ingolf Krueger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krueger:Ingolf"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
