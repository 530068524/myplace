There are arbitrary interference constraints on the set of links that can be served simultaneously at any given time. These interference constraints impose a fundamental lower bound on the delay performance of any scheduling policy for the system. We present a methodology to derive such lower bounds. For the tandem queue network, where the delay optimal policy is known, the expected delay of the optimal policy numerically coincides with the lower bound. We conduct extensive numerical studies to suggest that the average delay of the back-pressure scheduling policy can be made close to the lower bound by using appropriate functions of queue length.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Gagan Rajesh Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Gagan_Rajesh", "Ness B.
