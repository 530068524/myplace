{"title": "Approximating connectivity domination in weighted bounded-genus graphs.", "fields": ["maximal independent set", "bidimensionality", "pathwidth", "clique sum", "vertex cover"], "abstract": "We present a framework for addressing several problems on weighted planar graphs and graphs of bounded genus. With that framework, we derive polynomial-time approximation schemes for the following problems in planar graphs or graphs of bounded genus: edge-weighted tree cover and tour cover; vertex-weighted connected dominating set, max-weight-leaf spanning tree, and connected vertex cover. In addition, we obtain a polynomial-time approximation scheme for feedback vertex set in planar graphs. These are the first polynomial-time approximation schemes for all those problems in weighted embedded graphs. (For unweighted versions of some of these problems, polynomial-time approximation schemes were previously given using bidimensionality.)", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Brown University", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Brown University", "ENS, France"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Vincent Cohen-Addad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen=Addad:Vincent", "\u00c9ric Colin de Verdi\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verdi=egrave=re:=Eacute=ric_Colin_de", "Philip N.
