{"title": "Unsupervised Relation Discovery with Sense Disambiguation.", "fields": ["generative grammar", "hierarchical clustering", "topic model", "syntax", "merge", "computational linguistics"], "abstract": "To discover relation types from text, most methods cluster shallow or syntactic patterns of relation mentions, but consider only one possible sense per pattern. In practice this assumption is often violated. In this paper we overcome this issue by inducing clusters of pattern senses from feature representations of patterns. In particular, we employ a topic model to partition entity pairs associated with patterns into sense clusters using local and global features. We merge these sense clusters into semantic relations using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We compare against several baselines: a generative latent-variable model, a clustering method that does not disambiguate between path senses, and our own approach but with only local features. Experimental results show our proposed approach discovers dramatically more accurate clusters than models without sense disambiguation, and that incorporating global features, such as the document theme, is crucial.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Limin Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Limin", "Sebastian Riedel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riedel_0001:Sebastian", "Andrew McCallum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCallum:Andrew"], "pages": 9}
