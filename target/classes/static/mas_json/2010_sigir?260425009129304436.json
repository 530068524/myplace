Our method represents each document as a real-valued sparse  k -gram vector, where the weights are learned to optimize for a specified similarity function, such as the cosine similarity or the Jaccard coefficient. Near-duplicate documents can be reliably detected through this improved similarity measure. In addition, these vectors can be mapped to a small number of hash-values as document signatures through the locality sensitive hashing scheme for efficient similarity computation. We demonstrate our approach in two target domains: Web news articles and email messages. Our method is not only more accurate than the commonly used methods such as Shingles and I-Match, but also shows consistent improvement across the domains, which is a desired property lacked by existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Hannaneh Hajishirzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hajishirzi:Hannaneh", "Wen-tau Yih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yih:Wen=tau", "Aleksander Kolcz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolcz:Aleksander"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
