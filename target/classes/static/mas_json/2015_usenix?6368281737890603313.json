The need for durable and secure storage for personal data further compounds this problem as these features incur energy-intensive operations. This paper presents WearDrive, a fast storage system for wearables based on battery-backed RAM and an efficient means to offload energy intensive tasks to the phone. WearDrive leverages low-power network connectivity available on wearables to trade the phone's battery for the wearable's by performing large and energy-intensive tasks on the phone while performing small and energy-efficient tasks locally using battery-backed RAM. WearDrive improves the performance of wearable applications by up to 8.85x and improves battery life up to 3.69x with negligible impact to the phone's battery life.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jian Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0006:Jian", "Anirudh Badam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badam:Anirudh", "Ranveer Chandra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandra:Ranveer", "Edmund B.
