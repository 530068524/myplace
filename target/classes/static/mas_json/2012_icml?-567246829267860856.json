{"title": "Fast classification using sparse decision DAGs.", "fields": ["hyperparameter", "small number", "adaboost", "markov decision process", "ranking"], "abstract": "In this paper we propose an algorithm that builds sparse decision DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) from a list of base classifiers provided by an external learning method such as AdaBoost. The basic idea is to cast the DAG design task as a Markov decision process. Each instance can decide to use or to skip each base classifier, based on the current state of the classifier being built. The result is a sparse decision DAG where the base classifiers are selected in a data-dependent way. The method has a single hyperparameter with a clear semantics of controlling the accuracy/speed trade-off. The algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art cascade detectors on three object-detection benchmarks, and it clearly outperforms them when there is a small number of base classifiers. Unlike cascades, it is also readily applicable for multi-class classification. Using the multi-class setup, we show on a benchmark Web page ranking data set that we can significantly improve the decision speed without harming the performance of the ranker.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud", "Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "University of Paris-Sud"], "authors": ["R\u00f3bert Busa-Fekete.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Busa=Fekete:R=oacute=bert", "Djalel Benbouzid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benbouzid:Djalel", "Bal\u00e1zs K\u00e9gl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=eacute=gl:Bal=aacute=zs"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
