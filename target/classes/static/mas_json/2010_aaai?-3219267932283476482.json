However, policy improvements often result in the loss of information. Hence, it has been marred by premature convergence and implausible solutions. As first suggested in the context of covariant policy gradients (Bagnell and Schneider 2003), many of these problems may be addressed by constraining the information loss. In this paper, we continue this path of reasoning and suggest the Relative Entropy Policy Search (REPS) method. The resulting method differs significantly from previous policy gradient approaches and yields an exact update step. It works well on typical reinforcement learning benchmark problems.", "citation": "Citations (284)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Jan Peters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peters_0001:Jan", "Katharina M\u00fclling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=lling:Katharina", "Yasemin Altun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altun:Yasemin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
