{"title": "Adversarial Constraint Learning for Structured Prediction.", "fields": ["subject matter expert", "constraint learning", "small number", "structured prediction", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "Constraint-based learning reduces the burden of collecting labels by having users specify general properties of structured outputs, such as constraints imposed by physical laws. We propose a novel framework for simultaneously learning these constraints and using them for supervision, bypassing the difficulty of using domain expertise to manually specify constraints. Learning requires a black-box simulator of structured outputs, which generates valid labels, but need not model their corresponding inputs or the input-label relationship. At training time, we constrain the model to produce outputs that cannot be distinguished from simulated labels by adversarial training. Providing our framework with a small number of labeled inputs gives rise to a new semi-supervised structured prediction model; we evaluate this model on multiple tasks --- tracking, pose estimation and time series prediction --- and find that it achieves high accuracy with only a small number of labeled inputs. In some cases, no labels are required at all.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Hongyu Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Hongyu", "Russell Stewart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stewart:Russell", "Jiaming Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Jiaming", "Volodymyr Kuleshov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuleshov:Volodymyr", "Stefano Ermon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ermon:Stefano"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
