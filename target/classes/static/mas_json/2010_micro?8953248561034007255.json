While there has been substantial work on automatic detection of atomicity violations, each existing technique has focused on a certain type of atomic region. To address this limitation, this paper presents Atom Tracker, a comprehensive approach to atomic region inference and violation detection. Atom Tracker is the first scheme to (1) automatically infer generic atomic regions (not limited by issues such as the number of variables accessed, the number of instructions included, or the type of code construct the region is embedded in) and (2) automatically detect violations of them at runtime with negligible execution overhead. Atom Tracker provides novel algorithms to infer generic atomic regions and to detect atomicity violations of them. Moreover, we present a hardware implementation of the violation detection algorithm that leverages cache coherence state transitions in a multiprocessor. In our evaluation, we take eight atomicity violation bugs from real-world codes like Apache, MySql, and Mozilla, and show that Atom Tracker detects them all. In addition, Atom Tracker automatically infers all of the atomic regions in a set of micro benchmarks accurately. Finally, we also show that the hardware implementation induces a negligible execution time overhead of 0.2\u20134.0% and, therefore, enables Atom Tracker to find atomicity violations on-the-fly in production runs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Renesas Electronics", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Abdullah Muzahid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muzahid:Abdullah", "Norimasa Otsuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Otsuki:Norimasa", "Josep Torrellas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torrellas:Josep"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2010", "pages": 11}
