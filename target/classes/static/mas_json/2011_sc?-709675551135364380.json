Within this framework, we study the critical paths and performance of algorithms such as Sameh-Kuck, Fibonacci, Greedy, and those found within PLASMA. Although neither Fibonacci nor Greedy is optimal, both are shown to be asymptotically optimal for all matrices of size  p  =  q  2  f ( q ), where  f  is any function such that lim +\u221e   f  = 0. This novel and important complexity result applies to all matrices where  p  and  q  are proportional,  p  = \u03bb q , with \u03bb \u2265 1, thereby encompassing many important situations in practice (least squares). We provide an extensive set of experiments that show the superiority of the new algorithms for tall matrices.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Denver", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "University of Colorado Denver", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon"], "authors": ["Henricus Bouwmeester.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouwmeester:Henricus", "Mathias Jacquelin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacquelin:Mathias", "Julien Langou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langou:Julien", "Yves Robert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robert:Yves"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2011", "pages": 11}
