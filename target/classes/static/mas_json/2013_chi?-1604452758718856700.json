There are currently few studies of exergame systems which evaluate the impact on physical activity over time. Those which do, show increases in light intensity exercise which although valuable, do not increase the proportion of moderate to vigorous activity required for optimal health benefits. Furthermore, longitudinal studies to date have encountered a plateau effect in physical activity as the novelty of the game wears off. This paper suggests how exergame designs based on deeper understandings of player motivations could address these problems.   We report on longitudinal patterns of users' physical activity, motivations and behaviour when using exergames, based on case studies from a seven week long school based field trial. These new insights, interpreted through Bandura's theory of self efficacy, are of value to designers in the HCI community who wish to motivate users with a range of attitudes towards exercise to undertake regular moderate to vigorous physical activity.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["Heriot-Watt University", "Heriot-Watt University"], "authors": ["Andrew Peter Macvean.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Macvean:Andrew_Peter", "Judy Robertson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robertson:Judy"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
