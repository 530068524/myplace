{"title": "Cross-lingual Models of Word Embeddings: An Empirical Comparison.", "fields": ["almost surely", "machine learning", "natural language processing", "artificial intelligence", "syntax"], "abstract": "Despite interest in using cross-lingual knowledge to learn word embeddings for various tasks, a systematic comparison of the possible approaches is lacking in the literature. We perform an extensive evaluation of four popular approaches of inducing cross-lingual embeddings, each requiring a different form of supervision, on four typographically different language pairs. Our evaluation setup spans four different tasks, including intrinsic evaluation on mono-lingual and cross-lingual similarity, and extrinsic evaluation on downstream semantic and syntactic applications. We show that models which require expensive cross-lingual knowledge almost always perform better, but cheaply supervised models often prove competitive on certain tasks.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Computer Science"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shyam Upadhyay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Upadhyay:Shyam", "Manaal Faruqui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faruqui:Manaal", "Chris Dyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dyer:Chris", "Dan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Dan"], "pages": -1}
