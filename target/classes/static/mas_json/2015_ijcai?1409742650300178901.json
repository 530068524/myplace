We show that, unlike the propositional case, first-order DLP is strictly more expressive than NLP. This result still holds even if auxiliary predicates are allowed, assuming NP \u2260 coNP. On the other side, we propose a partial translation from first-order DLP to NLP via unfolding and shifting, which suggests a sound yet incomplete approach to implement DLP via NLP solvers. We also identify some NLP definable subclasses, and conjecture to exactly capture NLP definability by unfolding and shifting.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Western Sydney"], "authors": ["Yi Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
