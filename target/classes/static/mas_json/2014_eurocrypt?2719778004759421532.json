{"title": "Fully Key-Homomorphic Encryption, Arithmetic Circuit ABE and Compact Garbled Circuits.", "fields": ["homomorphic encryption", "multiplicative function", "attribute based encryption", "security parameter", "key"], "abstract": "We construct the first (key-policy) attribute-based encryption (ABE) system with short secret keys: the size of keys in our system depends only on the depth of the policy circuit, not its size. Our constructions extend naturally to arithmetic circuits with arbitrary fan-in gates thereby further reducing the circuit depth. Building on this ABE system we obtain the first reusable circuit garbling scheme that produces garbled circuits whose size is the same as the original circuit plus an additive poly(\u03bb,d) bits, where \u03bb is the security parameter and d is the circuit depth. All previous constructions incurred a multiplicative poly(\u03bb) blowup.", "citation": "Citations (194)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Stanford University", "IBM", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "IBM", "Stanford University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Dan Boneh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boneh:Dan", "Craig Gentry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentry:Craig", "Sergey Gorbunov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorbunov:Sergey", "Shai Halevi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halevi:Shai", "Valeria Nikolaenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikolaenko:Valeria", "Gil Segev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segev:Gil", "Vinod Vaikuntanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaikuntanathan:Vinod", "Dhinakaran Vinayagamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vinayagamurthy:Dhinakaran"], "pages": 24}
