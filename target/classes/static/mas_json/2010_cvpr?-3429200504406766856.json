This is important for applications with online template selection, such as SLAM, where it is essential to track a low number of preferably reliable templates. Our approach is based on simple image features specifically designed to identify texture properties which are problematic for tracking. During a training step, a support vector regresser is learned. It uses a tracking quality measure which considers both convergence rate and speed obtained by simulation of many tracking attempts. Finally, a minimum set of image features is identified to speedup the online selection process. In experiments on real-world video sequences our method improved the detection rate of an existing tracking-by-detection system by 8% on average.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["MediaTech Institute", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Nicolas Alt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alt:Nicolas", "Stefan Hinterstoisser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hinterstoisser:Stefan", "Nassir Navab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navab:Nassir"], "pages": 8}
