{"title": "Physikit: Data Engagement Through Physical Ambient Visualizations in the Home.", "fields": ["appropriation", "community engagement", "know how", "environmental data", "internet of things"], "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) devices and sensor kits have the potential to democratize the access, use, and appropriation of data. Despite the increased availability of low cost sensors, most of the produced data is \"black box\" in nature: users often do not know how to access or interpret data. We propose a \"human-data design\" approach in which end-users are given tools to create, share, and use data through tangible and physical visualizations. This paper introduces Physikit, a system designed to allow users to explore and engage with environmental data through physical ambient visualizations. We report on the design and implementation of Physikit, and present a two-week field study which showed that participants got an increased sense of the meaning of data, embellished and appropriated the basic visualizations to make them blend into their homes, and used the visualizations as a probe for community engagement and social behavior.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "UCL, London, United Kingdom"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Steven Houben.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Houben:Steven", "Connie Golsteijn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golsteijn:Connie", "Sarah Gallacher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gallacher:Sarah", "Rose Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Rose", "Saskia Bakker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bakker:Saskia", "Nicolai Marquardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marquardt:Nicolai", "Licia Capra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capra:Licia", "Yvonne Rogers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogers:Yvonne"], "pages": 12}
