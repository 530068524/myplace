However, privacy constraints can be difficult for users to specify, and worse yet, all possible situations that could lead to a privacy violation may not be known to the user a priori. To address these challenges, we propose a GUI-based interactive process for detecting such violations and generating appropriate constraints. In this work, we demonstrate two approaches to implementing such a GUI that provide different ways of analyzing and interactively optimizing a PASQL query plan.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["N.
