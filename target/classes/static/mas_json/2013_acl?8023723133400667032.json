In our approach we treat bilingual term extraction as a classification problem. For classification we use an SVM binary classifier and training data taken from the EUROVOC thesaurus. We test our approach on a held-out test set from EUROVOC and perform precision, recall and f-measure evaluations for 20 European language pairs. The performance of our classifier reaches the 100% precision level for many language pairs. We also perform manual evaluation on bilingual terms extracted from English-German term-tagged comparable corpora. The results of this manual evaluation showed 60-83% of the term pairs generated are exact translations and over 90% exact or partial translations.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "University of Sheffield", "University of Sheffield"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ahmet Aker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aker:Ahmet", "Monica Lestari Paramita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paramita:Monica_Lestari", "Robert J.
