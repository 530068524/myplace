Classic cake cutting protocols are susceptible to manipulation. Do their strategic outcomes still guarantee fairness? To address this question we adopt a novel algorithmic approach, proposing a concrete computational model and reasoning about the game-theoretic properties of algorithms that operate in this model. Specifically, we show that each protocol in the class of generalized cut and choose (GCC) protocols \u2014 which includes the most important discrete cake cutting protocols \u2014 is guaranteed to have approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibria, or even exact equilibria if the protocol's tie-breaking rule is flexible. We further observe that the (approximate) equilibria of proportional protocols \u2014 which guarantee each of the n agents a 1/n-fraction of the cake \u2014 must be (approximately) proportional, thereby answering the above question in the positive (at least for one common notion of fairness).", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Patras", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Simina Br\u00e2nzei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Br=acirc=nzei:Simina", "Ioannis Caragiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caragiannis:Ioannis", "David Kurokawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurokawa:David", "Ariel D.
