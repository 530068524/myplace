{"title": "Models of Action Concurrency in Temporal Planning.", "fields": ["machine learning", "simulation", "modeling language", "concurrency", "schedule"], "abstract": "Models of temporal planning are complex, due to the possibility of multiple concurrent and mutually interacting actions. This work compares two modeling languages, one with a PDDL-style action exclusion mechanism, and another with an explicit notion of resources, and investigates their implications on constraint-based search. The first mechanism forces temporal gaps in action schedules and have a high performance penalty. The second mechanism avoids the gaps, with dramatically improved performance.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Aalto University"], "authors": ["Jussi Rintanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rintanen:Jussi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
