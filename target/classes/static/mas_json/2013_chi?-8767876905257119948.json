Although audio data is straightforward to gather, automated analysis remains a challenging task; the existing expertise, local knowledge and motivation of the birder community can complement computational approaches and provide distinct benefits. We explored both the culture and practice of birders, and paradigms for interacting with recorded audio data. A variety of candidate design elements were tested with birders.   This study contributes an understanding of how virtual interactions and practices can be developed to complement existing practices of experienced birders in the physical world. In so doing this study contributes a new approach to engagement in e-science. Whereas most citizen science projects task lay participants with discrete real world or artificial activities, sometimes using extrinsic motivators, this approach builds on existing intrinsically satisfying practices.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology"], "authors": ["Mark Cottman-Fields.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cottman=Fields:Mark", "Margot Brereton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brereton:Margot", "Paul Roe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roe:Paul"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
