Interaction designers are frequently not expert in pattern recognition, which may be one reason for this lack of availability. Another issue is how to effectively test gestures to ensure that they are not unintentionally activated by a user's normal movements during everyday usage. We present MAGIC, a gesture design tool that addresses both of these issues, and detail the results of an evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (112)", "departments": ["Nokia", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Daniel Ashbrook.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ashbrook:Daniel", "Thad Starner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Starner:Thad"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
