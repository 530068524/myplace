While almost as efficient as Icart's encoding, this hash function can be plugged into any cryptosystem that requires hashing into elliptic curves, while not compromising proofs of security in the random oracle model.\n\nWe also describe a more general (but less efficient) construction that works for a large class of encodings into elliptic curves, for example the Shallue-Woestijne-Ulas (SWU) algorithm. Finally we describe the first deterministic encoding algorithm into elliptic curves in characteristic 3.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "departments": ["Ingenico", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "Universit\u00e9 du Luxembourg", "Universit\u00e9 du Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Eric Brier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brier:Eric", "Jean-S\u00e9bastien Coron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coron:Jean=S=eacute=bastien", "Thomas Icart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Icart:Thomas", "David Madore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madore:David", "Hugues Randriam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Randriam:Hugues", "Mehdi Tibouchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tibouchi:Mehdi"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2010", "pages": 18}
