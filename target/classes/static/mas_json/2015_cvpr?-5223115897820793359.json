While most of these schemes produce impressive results, they all share an important limitation: their high computational complexity makes it challenging to use them for large-scale problems. In this work, we propose an approximate locality-constrained encoding scheme that offers significantly better computational efficiency (\u223c 40\u00d7) than its exact counterpart, with comparable classification accuracy. Using the perturbation analysis of least-squares problems, we present a formal approximation error analysis of our approach, which helps distill the intuition behind the robustness of our method. We present a thorough set of empirical analyses on multiple standard data-sets, to assess the capability of our encoding scheme for its representational as well as discriminative accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "DigitalGlobe"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Da Kuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuang:Da", "Alex Gittens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gittens:Alex", "Raffay Hamid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamid:Raffay"], "pages": 9}
