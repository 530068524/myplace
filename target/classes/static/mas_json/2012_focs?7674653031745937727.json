{"title": "A Permanent Approach to the Traveling Salesman Problem.", "fields": ["graph bandwidth", "tutte polynomial", "voltage graph", "quartic graph", "factor critical graph"], "abstract": "A randomized polynomial time algorithm is presented which, for every simple, connected, $k$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, finds a tour that visits every vertex and has length at most $\\left(1+\\sqrt{\\nfrac{64}{\\ln k}} \\right) n$ with high probability. The proof follows simply from results developed in the context of permanents, Egorychev's and Falikman's theorem which lower bounds the permanent of a doubly stochastic matrix and the polynomial time algorithm of Jerrum, Sinclair and Vigoda which samples a near-random, perfect matching from a bipartite graph. The techniques in this paper suggest new permanent-based approaches for TSP which could be useful in attacking other interesting cases of TSP.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Nisheeth K.
