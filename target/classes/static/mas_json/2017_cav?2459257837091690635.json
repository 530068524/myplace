{"title": "Compositional Model Checking with Incremental Counter-Example Construction.", "fields": ["counterexample", "state space", "model checking", "correctness", "temporal logic"], "abstract": "In compositional model checking, the approach is to reason about the correctness of a system by lifting results obtained in analyses of subsystems to the system-level. The main challenge, however, is that requirements, in the form of temporal logic formulae, are usually specified at the system-level, and it is not obvious how to relate these to subsystem-local behaviour. In this paper, we propose a new approach to checking regular safety properties, which we call Incremental Counter-Example Construction (ICC). Its main strong point is that it performs a series of model checking procedures, and that each one only explores a small part of the entire state space. This makes ICC an excellent approach in those cases where state space explosion is an issue. Moreover, it is frequently much faster than traditional explicit-state model checking, particularly when the model satisfies the verified property, and in most cases not significantly slower. We explain the technique, and report on experiments we have conducted using an implementation of ICC, comparing the results to those obtained with other approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Anton Wijs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wijs:Anton", "Thomas Neele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neele:Thomas"], "pages": 21}
