In this paper, we propose an advertising system named Video eCommerce to exhibit appropriate product ads to particular users at proper time stamps of videos, which takes into account video semantics, user shopping preference and viewing behavior feedback by a two-level strategy. At the first level, Co-Relation Regression (CRR) model is novelly proposed to construct the semantic association between keyframes and products. Heterogeneous information network (HIN) is adopted to build the user shopping preference from two different e-commerce platforms, Tmall and MagicBox, which alleviates the problems of data sparsity and cold start. In addition, Video Scene Importance Model (VSIM) utilizes the viewing behavior of users to embed ads at the most attractive position within the video stream. At the second level, taking the results of CRR, HIN and VSIM as the input, Heterogeneous Relation Matrix Factorization (HRMF) is applied for product advertising. Extensive evaluation on a variety of online videos from Tmall MagicBox demonstrates that Video eCommerce achieves promising performance, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art advertising methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Southwest Jiaotong University", "Alibaba Group", "Southwest Jiaotong University", "Alibaba Group"], "authors": ["Zhi-Qi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Zhi=Qi", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yang", "Xiao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Xiao", "Xian-Sheng Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Xian=Sheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
