These simulations outperform by one to three orders of magnitude the current state of the art in terms of numbers of simulated cells and computational elements. The computational setup emulates the conditions and the geometric complexity of microfluidic experiments and our results reproduce the experimental findings. These simulations provide sub-micron resolution while accessing time scales relevant to engineering designs. We demonstrate an improvement of up to 45X over competing state-of-the-art solvers, thus establishing the frontiers of simulations by particle based methods. Our simulations redefine the role of computational science for the development of microfluidics -- a technology that is becoming as important to medicine as integrated circuits have been to computers.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Brown University", "University of Lugano", "ETH Zurich", "CNR, Italy"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Diego Rossinelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossinelli:Diego", "Yu-Hang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Yu=Hang", "Kirill Lykov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lykov:Kirill", "Dmitry Alexeev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alexeev:Dmitry", "Massimo Bernaschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bernaschi:Massimo", "Panagiotis E.
