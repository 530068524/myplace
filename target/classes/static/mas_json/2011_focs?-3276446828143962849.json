{"title": "A Small PRG for Polynomial Threshold Functions of Gaussians.", "fields": ["pseudorandom generators for polynomials", "hypercube", "random number generation", "pseudorandom number generator", "pseudorandom generator"], "abstract": "We discuss a psuedorandom generator to $\\epsilon$-fool degree-d polynomial threshold functions with respect to the Gaussian distribution with seed length $2^O_c(d)\\log(n) \\epsilon^{-4-c}$. Our analysis involves several new ideas including what we term the \"noisy derivative\" of a function and a stronger version of standard anticoncentration results.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Daniel M.
