For the summarization, we solve an optimization problem where the ROUGE score of the selected summary sentences is maximized. To this end, we derive an approximation of the ROUGE-N score of a set of sentences, and define a principled discrete optimization problem for sentence selection. Mathematical and empirical evidence suggests that the sentence selection step is solved almost exactly, thus reducing the problem to the sentence scoring task. We perform a detailed experimental evaluation on two DUC datasets to demonstrate the validity of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Maxime Peyrard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peyrard:Maxime", "Judith Eckle-Kohler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eckle=Kohler:Judith"], "pages": -1}
