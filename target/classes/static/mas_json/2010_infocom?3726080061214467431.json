{"title": "High-Speed Per-Flow Traffic Measurement with Probabilistic Multiplicity Counting.", "fields": ["network packet", "backbone network", "approximation error", "multiplicity", "data set", "bit field", "probabilistic logic"], "abstract": "On today's high-speed backbone network links, measuring per-\ufb02ow traf\ufb01c information has become very challenging. Maintaining exact per-\ufb02ow packet counters on OC-192 or OC-768 links is not practically feasible due to computational and cost constrains. Packet sampling as implemented in today's routers results in large approximation errors. Here, we present Probabilistic Multiplicity Counting (PMC), a novel data structure that is capable of accounting traf\ufb01c per \ufb02ow probabilistically. The PMC algorithm is very simple and highly parallelizable, and therefore allows for ef\ufb01cient implementations in software and hardware. At the same time, it provides very accurate traf\ufb01c statistics. We evaluate PMC with both arti\ufb01cial and real-world traf\ufb01c data, demonstrating that it outperforms other approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of D\u00fcsseldorf", "University of D\u00fcsseldorf"], "authors": ["Peter Lieven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lieven:Peter", "Bj\u00f6rn Scheuermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scheuermann_0001:Bj=ouml=rn"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
