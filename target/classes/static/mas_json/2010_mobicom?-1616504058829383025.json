This paper provides a broader exploration of the design space of indoor directional antenna systems along two main dimensions: antenna configuration and antenna control. Studying a number of alternative configurations, we find that directionality on APs and clients can significantly improve performance, even over other configurations with stronger directionality. Moreover, it is sufficient to have a small number of narrow beam antennas to achieve such gains, thus making such a solution practical for actual deployment. Designing systems with directional APs and clients for increased spatial reuse comes, however, with a number of challenges in the way the directional antennas are controlled. Antenna control needs to encompass antenna orientation algorithms, an appropriate MAC layer protocol, and novel client-AP association solutions. To overcome these challenges, we propose Speed, a distributed directional antenna control system that is easy to deploy and significantly improves network capacity over existing solutions.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Xi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xi", "Anmol Sheth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheth:Anmol", "Michael Kaminsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaminsky:Michael", "Konstantina Papagiannaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papagiannaki:Konstantina", "Srinivasan Seshan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seshan:Srinivasan", "Peter Steenkiste.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steenkiste:Peter"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
