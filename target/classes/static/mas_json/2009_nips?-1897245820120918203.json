{"title": "Dirichlet-Bernoulli Alignment: A Generative Model for Multi-Class Multi-Label Multi-Instance Corpora.", "fields": ["dirichlet distribution", "bernoulli s principle", "generative model", "bernoulli process", "entity linking"], "abstract": "We propose Dirichlet-Bernoulli Alignment (DBA), a generative model for corpora in which each pattern (e.g., a document) contains a set of instances (e.g., paragraphs in the document) and belongs to multiple classes. By casting predefined classes as latent Dirichlet variables (i.e., instance level labels), and modeling the multi-label of each pattern as Bernoulli variables conditioned on the weighted empirical average of topic assignments, DBA automatically aligns the latent topics discovered from data to human-defined classes. DBA is useful for both pattern classification and instance disambiguation, which are tested on text classification and named entity disambiguation in web search queries respectively.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shuang-Hong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shuang=Hong", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan", "Bao-Gang Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Bao=Gang"], "pages": 8}
