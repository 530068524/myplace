{"title": "EventSearch: a system for event discovery and retrieval on multi-type historical data.", "fields": ["clips", "analytics", "war", "ranking", "complex event processing"], "abstract": "We present EventSearch, a system for event extraction and retrieval on four types of news-related historical data, i.e., Web news articles, newspapers, TV news program, and micro-blog short messages. The system incorporates over 11 million web pages extracted from \"Web InfoMall\", the Chinese Web Archive since 2001. The newspaper and TV news video clips also span from 2001 to 2011. The system, upon a user query, returns a list of event snippets from multiple data sources. A novel burst model is used to discover events from time-stamped texts. In addition to offline event extraction, our system also provides online event extraction to further meet the user needs. EventSearch provides meaningful analytics that synthesize an accurate description of events. Users interact with the system by ranking the identified events using different criteria (scale, recency and relevance) and submitting their own information needs in different input fields.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Dongdong Shan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shan:Dongdong", "Wayne Xin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wayne_Xin", "Rishan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Rishan", "Baihan Shu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shu:Baihan", "Ziqi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ziqi", "Junjie Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Junjie", "Hongfei Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Hongfei", "Xiaoming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiaoming"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
