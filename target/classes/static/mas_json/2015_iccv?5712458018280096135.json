However, less research attention has been focused on multi-class active learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Gaussian process classifier model with multiple annotators for multi-class visual recognition. Expectation propagation (EP) is adopted for efficient approximate Bayesian inference of our probabilistic model for classification. Based on the EP approximation inference, a generalized Expectation Maximization (GEM) algorithm is derived to estimate both the parameters for instances and the quality of each individual annotator. Also, we incorporate the idea of reinforcement learning to actively select both the informative samples and the high-quality annotators, which better explores the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. The experiments clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stevens Institute of Technology", "Microsoft"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Chengjiang Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Chengjiang", "Gang Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Gang"], "pages": 9}
