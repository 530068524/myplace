{"title": "Classifying French Verbs Using French and English Lexical Resources.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "french verbs", "syntax", "test set", "verbnet"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach to the automatic acquisition of a Verbnet like classification of French verbs which involves the use (i) of a neural clustering method which associates clusters with features, (ii) of several supervised and unsupervised evaluation metrics and (iii) of various existing syntactic and semantic lexical resources. We evaluate our approach on an established test set and show that it outperforms previous related work with an F-measure of 0.70.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Lorraine", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Strasbourg"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ingrid Falk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Falk:Ingrid", "Claire Gardent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gardent:Claire", "Jean-Charles Lamirel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lamirel:Jean=Charles"], "pages": 10}
