{"title": "Non-diffuse effects for point-based global illumination.", "fields": ["rendering equation", "global illumination", "ambient occlusion", "real time rendering", "color bleeding"], "abstract": "Point-Based Global Illumination (PBGI) [2008] is a popular rendering method in special effects and motion picture productions. This algorithm provides a diffuse global illumination solution by caching radiance in a mesh-less hierarchical data structure during a pre-process, while solving for visibility over this cache, at rendering time and for each receiver, using microbuffers, which are localized depth and color buffer inspired from real time rendering environments. As a result, noise free ambient occlusion, indirect soft shadows and color bleeding effects are computed efficiently for high resolution image output and in a temporally coherent fashion. We propose an evolution of this method to address the case of non-diffuse inter-reflections and refractions using wavelets instead of spherical harmonics (see Fig. 1). We also propose a new importance-driven adaptive microbuffer model to capture accurately incoming radiance at a point. Furthermore, we evaluate outgoing radiance using a fast wavelet radiance product, containing the memory footprint by encoding hierarchically the wavelets tree.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "Shandong University", "Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com"], "authors": ["Beibei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Beibei", "Xiangxu Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Xiangxu", "Tamy Boubekeur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boubekeur:Tamy"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
