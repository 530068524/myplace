{"title": "All-Match Based Complete Redundancy Removal for Packet Classifiers in TCAMs.", "fields": ["network packet", "statistical classification", "content addressable memory", "ternary operation", "content addressable storage"], "abstract": "Packet classification is the core mechanism that enables many networking services on the Internet such as firewall packet filtering and traffic accounting. Using Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) to perform high-speed packet classification has become the de facto standard in industry. TCAMs classify packets in constant time by comparing a packet with all classification rules of ternary encoding in parallel. Despite their high speed, TCAMs suffer from the well-known interval expansion problem. As packet classification rules usually have fields specified as intervals, converting such rules to TCAM- compatible rules may result in an explosive increase in the number of rules. This is not a problem if TCAMs have large capacities. Unfortunately, TCAMs have very limited capacity, and more rules means more power consumption and more heat generation for TCAMs. Even worse, the number of rules in packet classifiers have been increasing rapidly with the growing number of services deployed on the internet. The interval expansion problem of TCAMs can be addressed by removing redundant rules in packet classifiers. This equivalent transformation can significantly reduce the number of TCAM entries needed by a packet classifier. Our experiments on real- life packet classifiers show an average reduction of 58.2% in the number of TCAM entries by removing redundant rules. In this paper, we propose an all-match based complete redundancy removal algorithm. This is the first algorithm that attempts to solve first-match problems from an all-match perspective. We formally prove that our redundancy removal algorithm guarantees no redundant rules in resulting packet classifiers. We conducted extensive experiments on both real-life and synthetic packet classifiers. These experimental results show that our redundancy removal algorithm is both effective in terms of reducing TCAM entries and efficient in terms of running time.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University"], "authors": ["Alex X.
