We propose gradient-based and random gradient-free methods to solve this problem. Our algorithms are based on the concept of an inexact oracle and unlike the state-of-the-art gradient-based method we manage to provide theoretically the convergence rate guarantees for both of them. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed optimization methods with the state of the art applied to a ranking task.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Yandex", "Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology", "Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology", "Yandex", "Catholic University of Leuven"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Lev Bogolubsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogolubsky:Lev", "Pavel Dvurechensky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dvurechensky:Pavel", "Alexander Gasnikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gasnikov:Alexander", "Gleb Gusev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gusev:Gleb", "Yurii Nesterov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nesterov:Yurii", "Andrei M.
