In the binary consensus problem, each node initially holds one of two states and the goal for each node is to correctly decide which one of these two states was initially held by a majority of nodes. We derive an upper bound on the expected convergence time that holds for arbitrary connected graphs, which is based on the location of eigenvalues of some contact rate matrices. We instantiate our bound for particular networks of interest, including complete graphs, paths, cycles, star-shaped networks, and Erdos\u2013Renyi random graphs; for these graphs, we compare our bound with alternative computations. We find that for all these examples our bound is tight, yielding the exact order with respect to the numbe...", "citation": "Citations (88)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Moez Draief.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Draief:Moez", "Milan Vojnovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vojnovic:Milan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
