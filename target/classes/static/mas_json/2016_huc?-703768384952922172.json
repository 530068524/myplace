This paper introduces  permission-UI mapping  as an easy-to-understand representation to illustrate how permissions are used by different UI components within a given application. Connecting UI components to permissions helps users to understand the purpose of permission requests and also makes it possible to illustrate permission requests in a fine-grained manner. We propose PERUIM to extract the permission-UI mapping from an application based on both dynamic and static analysis, and represent the analysis results with a graphical representation. Experiments on popular mobile applications demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Yuanchun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuanchun", "Yao Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo_0001:Yao", "Xiangqun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiangqun"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
