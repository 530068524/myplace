{"title": "Identifying Adverse Drug Events by Relational Learning.", "fields": ["pharmaceutical industry", "inductive logic programming", "statistical relational learning", "pharmacovigilance", "postmarketing surveillance"], "abstract": "The pharmaceutical industry, consumer protection groups, users of medications and government oversight agencies are all strongly interested in identifying adverse reactions to drugs. While a clinical trial of a drug may use only a thousand patients, once a drug is released on the market it may be taken by millions of patients. As a result, in many cases adverse drug events (ADEs) are observed in the broader population that were not identified during clinical trials. Therefore, there is a need for continued, postmarketing surveillance of drugs to identify previously-unanticipated ADEs. This paper casts this problem as a reverse machine learning task, related to relational subgroup discovery and provides an initial evaluation of this approach based on experiments with an actual EMR/EHR and known adverse drug events.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Wake Forest University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Marshfield Clinic", "CRACS-INESC TEC and FCUP"], "authors": ["David Page.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Page:David", "V\u00edtor Santos Costa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costa:V=iacute=tor_Santos", "Sriraam Natarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Natarajan:Sriraam", "Aubrey Barnard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barnard:Aubrey", "Peggy L.
