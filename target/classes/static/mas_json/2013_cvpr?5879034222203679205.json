{"title": "Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow.", "fields": ["flow network", "video tracking", "multi commodity flow problem", "lagrangian relaxation", "smoothness"], "abstract": "We propose a method for global multi-target tracking that can incorporate higher-order track smoothness constraints such as constant velocity. Our problem formulation readily lends itself to path estimation in a trellis graph, but unlike previous methods, each node in our network represents a candidate pair of matching observations between consecutive frames. Extra constraints on binary flow variables in the graph result in a problem that can no longer be solved by min-cost network flow. We therefore propose an iterative solution method that relaxes these extra constraints using Lagrangian relaxation, resulting in a series of problems that ARE solvable by min-cost flow, and that progressively improve towards a high-quality solution to our original optimization problem. We present experimental results showing that our method outperforms the standard network-flow formulation as well as other recent algorithms that attempt to incorporate higher-order smoothness constraints.", "citation": "Citations (191)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Asad A.
