In this paper we present OpenTDMF, an architecture to enable TDMA on commodity WLAN devices. Our hope is to provide the desirable features without entirely rebuilding the WLAN infrastructure. OpenTDMF is inspired by and architecturally similar to Software Defined Networking (SDN). Specifically, we leverage the backhaul of WLAN to coordinate all the stations for channel access. This fine-grained coordination is performed in a decoupled control plane which includes a central controller and programmable APs. To realize OpenTDMF on commodity WLAN devices, we develop several novel techniques to achieve \u03bcs-level time synchronization among all the APs. We also enable AP-triggered uplink transmission so that all the transmissions in the WLAN can be determined. We implemented a prototype of OpenTDMF based on commodity WLAN devices. Empirical results validate the OpenTDMF design and demonstrate its benefits.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Zhice Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhice", "Jiansong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jiansong", "Kun Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kun", "Qian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Qian", "Yongguang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yongguang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
