{"title": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Integers with Shorter Public Keys.", "fields": ["homomorphic encryption", "brute force attack", "public key cryptography", "linear form", "semantic security"], "abstract": "At Eurocrypt 2010 van Dijk et al. described a fully homomorphic encryption scheme over the integers. The main appeal of this scheme (compared to Gentry's) is its conceptual simplicity. This simplicity comes at the expense of a public key size in O(\u03bb10) which is too large for any practical system. In this paper we reduce the public key size to O(\u03bb7) by encrypting with a quadratic form in the public key elements, instead of a linear form. We prove that the scheme remains semantically secure, based on a stronger variant of the approximate-GCD problem, already considered by van Dijk et al.\n\nWe alsodescribe the first implementation of the resulting fully homomorphic scheme. Borrowing some optimizations from the recent Gentry-Halevi implementation of Gentry's scheme, we obtain roughly the same level of efficiency. This shows that fully homomorphic encryption can be implemented using simple arithmetic operations.", "citation": "Citations (433)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Universit\u00e9 du Luxembourg", "Universit\u00e9 du Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Jean-S\u00e9bastien Coron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coron:Jean=S=eacute=bastien", "Avradip Mandal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mandal:Avradip", "David Naccache.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naccache:David", "Mehdi Tibouchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tibouchi:Mehdi"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2011", "pages": 18}
