This has been a longstanding issue for data quality, and is challenging when the true values of  e  are unknown. This paper proposes a model for determining relative accuracy. (1) We introduce a class of accuracy rules and an inference system with a chase procedure, to deduce relative accuracy. (2) We identify and study several fundamental problems for relative accuracy. Given a set  I  e  of tuples pertaining to the same entity  e  and a set of accuracy rules, these problems are to decide whether the chase process terminates, is Church-Rosser, and leads to a unique target tuple  t  e  composed of the most accurate values from  I  e  for all the attributes of  e . (3) We propose a framework for inferring accurate values with user interaction. (4) We provide algorithms underlying the framework, to find the unique target tuple  t  e  whenever possible; when there is no enough information to decide a complete  t  e , we compute top- k  candidate targets based on a preference model. (5) Using real-life and synthetic data, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yang", "Wenfei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Wenfei", "Wenyuan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Wenyuan"], "pages": 12}
