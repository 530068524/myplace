{"title": "Exploiting Saliency for Object Segmentation from Image Level Labels.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "exploit", "salience", "segmentation", "labelling"], "abstract": "There have been remarkable improvements in the semantic labelling task in the recent years. However, the state of the art methods rely on large-scale pixel-level annotations. This paper studies the problem of training a pixel-wise semantic labeller network from image-level annotations of the present object classes. Recently, it has been shown that high quality seeds indicating discriminative object regions can be obtained from image-level labels. Without additional information, obtaining the full extent of the object is an inherently ill-posed problem due to co-occurrences. We propose using a saliency model as additional information and hereby exploit prior knowledge on the object extent and image statistics. We show how to combine both information sources in order to recover 80% of the fully supervised performance \u2013 which is the new state of the art in weakly supervised training for pixel-wise semantic labelling.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Seong Joon Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Seong_Joon", "Rodrigo Benenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benenson:Rodrigo", "Anna Khoreva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khoreva:Anna", "Zeynep Akata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akata:Zeynep", "Mario Fritz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fritz:Mario", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "pages": 10}
