By studying statistical correlations between image sequences from outdoor cameras and temperature measurements we identify two interesting interactions. First, semantically meaningful regions such as foliage and reflective oriented surfaces are often highly indicative of the temperature. Second, small camera motions are correlated with the temperature in some scenes. We propose simple scene-specific temperature prediction algorithms which can be used to turn a camera into a crude temperature sensor. We find that for this task, simple features such as local pixel intensities outperform sophisticated, global features such as from a semantically-trained convolutional neural network.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Harvard University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Harvard University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Daniel Glasner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glasner:Daniel", "Pascal Fua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fua:Pascal", "Todd E.
