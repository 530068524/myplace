Our technique is based on learning an approximate regular model of the set of feasible paths in a program, and testing whether this model contains an incorrect behavior. Exact learning algorithms require checking equivalence between the model and the program, which is a difficult problem, in general undecidable. Our learning procedure is therefore based on the framework of  probably approximately correct  (PAC) learning, which uses sampling instead, and provides correctness guarantees expressed using the terms  error probability  and  confidence . Besides the verification result, our procedure also outputs the model with the said correctness guarantees. Obtained preliminary experiments show encouraging results, in some cases even outperforming mature software verifiers.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "National Taiwan University", "Brno University of Technology", "National Taiwan University", "Academia Sinica"], "authors": ["Yu-Fang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yu=Fang", "Chiao Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Chiao", "Ondrej Leng\u00e1l.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leng=aacute=l:Ondrej", "Tsung-Ju Lii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lii:Tsung=Ju", "Ming-Hsien Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Ming=Hsien", "Bow-Yaw Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Bow=Yaw", "Farn Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Farn"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2016", "pages": 11}
