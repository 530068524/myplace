{"title": "Quasi-polynomial hitting-set for set-depth-\u0394 formulas.", "fields": ["polynomial", "combinatorics", "special case", "discrete mathematics", "polynomial identity testing"], "abstract": "We call a depth-4 formula C  set-depth-4  if there exists a (unknown) partition X 1 \u2294\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2294 X d  of the variable indices [n] that the top product layer respects, i.e. C(term{x})=\u2211 i=1  k  \u220f j=1  d  f i,j (term{x} X j  ), where f i,j  is a  sparse  polynomial in F[term{x} X j  ]. Extending this definition to any depth - we call a depth-D formula C (consisting of alternating layers of \u03a3 and \u03a0 gates, with a \u03a3-gate on top) a  set-depth-D  formula if every \u03a0-layer in C respects a (unknown) partition on the variables; if D is even then the product gates of the bottom-most \u03a0-layer are allowed to compute arbitrary monomials. In this work, we give a hitting-set generator for set-depth-D formulas (over  any  field) with running time polynomial in exp((D 2 log s)  \u0394 - 1 ), where s is the size bound on the input set-depth-D formula. In other words, we give a  quasi -polynomial time  blackbox  polynomial identity test for such constant-depth formulas. Previously, the very special case of D=3 (also known as  set-multilinear  depth-3 circuits) had no known sub-exponential time hitting-set generator. This was declared as an open problem by Shpilka & Yehudayoff (FnT-TCS 2010); the model being first studied by Nisan & Wigderson (FOCS 1995) and recently by Forbes & Shpilka (STOC 2012 & ECCC TR12-115). Our work settles this question, not only for depth-3 but, up to depth elog s / log log s, for a fixed constant e  Hadamard algebra , after applying a 'shift' on the variables. We propose a new algebraic conjecture about the  low-support rank-concentration  in the latter formulas, and manage to prove it in the case of set-depth-D formulas.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Indian Institute of Science", "Hausdorff Cente ... , Bonn, Germany"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Manindra Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Manindra", "Chandan Saha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saha_0001:Chandan", "Nitin Saxena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saxena_0001:Nitin"], "pages": 10}
