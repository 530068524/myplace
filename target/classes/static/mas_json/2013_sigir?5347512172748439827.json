We propose and study several general methods for scoring the explanatoriness of a sentence. We create new data sets and propose a new measure for evaluation. Experiment results show that the proposed methods are effective, outperforming a state of the art sentence ranking method for standard text summarization.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Stefan Raue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raue:Stefan", "Leif Azzopardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azzopardi:Leif", "Christopher W.
