We propose two improvements to current level-set tracking formulations. The first is a localized appearance model that uses additional level-sets in order to enforce a hierarchical subdivision of the object shape into multiple connected regions with distinct appearance models. The second is a novel mechanism to include detailed object shape information in the form of a per-pixel figure/ground probability map obtained from an object detection process. Both contributions are seamlessly integrated into the level-set framework. Together, they considerably improve the accuracy of the tracked segmentations. We experimentally evaluate our proposed approach on two challenging sequences and demonstrate its good performance in practice.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Esther Horbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horbert:Esther", "Konstantinos Rematas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rematas:Konstantinos", "Bastian Leibe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leibe:Bastian"], "pages": 8}
