Users interact with the display of the mouse using direct touch, whilst also performing regular cursor-based mouse interactions. We demonstrate some of the unique capabili-ties of such a device, in particular for interacting with auxil-iary windows, such as toolbars, palettes, pop-ups and dia-log-boxes. By migrating these windows onto LensMouse, challenges such as screen real-estate use and window man-agement can be alleviated. In a controlled experiment, we evaluate the effectiveness of LensMouse in reducing cursor movements for interacting with auxiliary windows. We also consider the concerns involving the view separation that results from introducing such a display-based device. Our results reveal that overall users are more effective with LenseMouse than with auxiliary application windows that are managed either in single or dual-monitor setups. We conclude by presenting other application scenarios that LensMouse could support.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Manitoba", "University of Manitoba", "University of Manitoba", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Xing-Dong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xing=Dong", "Edward Mak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mak:Edward", "David C.
