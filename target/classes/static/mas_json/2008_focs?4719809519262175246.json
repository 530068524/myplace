{"title": "Sequence Length Requirement of Distance-Based Phylogeny Reconstruction: Breaking the Polynomial Barrier.", "fields": ["parameter space", "binary logarithm", "molecular clock", "ultrametric space", "generation time"], "abstract": "We introduce a new distance-based phylogeny reconstruction technique which provably achieves, at sufficiently short branch lengths, a sequence length requirement growing slower than any polynomial. The technique is based on a new averaging procedure that implicitly reconstructs ancestral sequences.In the same token, we extend previous results on phase transitions in phylogeny reconstruction to general time-reversible models. More precisely, we show that in the so-called Kesten-Stigum zone---roughly, a region of the parameter space where ancestral sequences are well approximated by ``linear combinations'' of observed sequences---sequences of length e radiclog   n  suffice for reconstruction. Here n is the number of extant species. We improve this result to poly(log n) the ultrametric case. Surprisingly, this last result suggests that a UPGMA-type algorithm may in some sense be \"optimal'' under a molecular clock. Our results challenge---to some extent---the conventional wisdom that estimates of evolutionary distances alone carry significantly less information about phylogenies than full sequence datasets.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Microsoft"], "authors": ["S\u00e9bastien Roch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roch:S=eacute=bastien"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
