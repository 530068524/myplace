By introducing an intermediate representation \u201cgroup\u201d between images and object categories, GS-MKL attempts to find appropriate kernel combination for each group to get a finer depiction of object categories. For each category, images within a group share a set of kernel weights while images from different groups may employ distinct sets of kernel weights. In GS-MKL, such group-sensitive kernel combinations together with the multi-kernels based classifier are optimized in a joint manner to seek a trade-off between capturing the diversity and keeping the invariance for each category. Extensive experiments show that our proposed GS-MKL method has achieved encouraging performance over three challenging datasets.", "citation": "Citations (174)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jingjing Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jingjing", "Yuanning Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuanning", "Yonghong Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Yonghong", "Lingyu Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Lingyu", "Wen Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Wen"], "pages": 8}
