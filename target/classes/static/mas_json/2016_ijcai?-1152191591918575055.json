For effective learning, ensemble methods are developed to build a strong effective model from ensemble of weak models. For robust learning, self-paced learning (SPL) is proposed to learn in a self-controlled pace from easy samples to complex ones. Motivated by simultaneously enhancing the learning effectiveness and robustness, we propose a unified framework, Self-Paced Boost Learning (SPBL). With an adaptive from-easy-to-hard pace in boosting process, SPBL asymptotically guides the model to focus more on the insufficiently learned samples with higher reliability. Via a max-margin boosting optimization with self-paced sample selection, SPBL is capable of capturing the intrinsic inter-class discriminative patterns while ensuring the reliability of the samples involved in learning. We formulate SPBL as a fully-corrective optimization for classification. The experiments on several real-world datasets show the superiority of SPBL in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Te Pi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pi:Te", "Xi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xi", "Zhongfei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhongfei", "Deyu Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Deyu", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Jun Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao_0001:Jun", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "pages": 7}
