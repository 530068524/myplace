We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identification) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a flexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efficient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and, instead, infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Link\u00f6ping University", "Link\u00f6ping University", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Roger Frigola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frigola:Roger", "Fredrik Lindsten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindsten:Fredrik", "Thomas B.
