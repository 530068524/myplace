The development of efficient gradient descent based optimization schemes has made it possible to tackle large scale problems. Simultaneously, MKL based algorithms have achieved very good results on challenging real world applications. Yet, despite their successes, MKL approaches are limited in that they focus on learning a linear combination of given base kernels.   In this paper, we observe that existing MKL formulations can be extended to learn general kernel combinations subject to general regularization. This can be achieved while retaining all the efficiency of existing large scale optimization algorithms. To highlight the advantages of generalized kernel learning, we tackle feature selection problems on benchmark vision and UCI databases. It is demonstrated that the proposed formulation can lead to better results not only as compared to traditional MKL but also as compared to state-of-the-art wrapper and filter methods for feature selection.", "citation": "Citations (414)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad"], "authors": ["Manik Varma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varma:Manik", "Bodla Rakesh Babu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babu:Bodla_Rakesh"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
