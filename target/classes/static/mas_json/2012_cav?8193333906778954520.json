Many operations needed by an abstract interpreter can be reduced to the problem of symbolic abstraction: the symbolic abstraction of a formula \u03d5 in logic, denoted by, is the most-precise value in abstract domain that over-approximates the meaning of \u03d5. We present a parametric framework that, given and, implements. The algorithm computes successively better over-approximations of. Because it approaches from \"above\", if it is taking too much time, a safe answer can be returned at any stage.\n\nMoreover, the framework is\"dual-use\": in addition to its applications in abstract interpretation, it provides a new way for an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver to perform unsatisfiability checking: given, the condition implies that \u03d5 is unsatisfiable.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Aditya V.
