{"title": "Testing Peers' Volatility.", "fields": ["software development", "test case", "security testing", "correctness", "schedule"], "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) is becoming a key technology for software development, but still lacks integrated solutions to build trust in the final software, in terms of correctness and security. Testing such systems is difficult because of the high numbers of nodes which can be volatile. In this paper, we present a framework for testing volatility of P2P systems. The framework is based on the individual control of peers, allowing test cases to precisely control the volatility of peers during execution. We validated our framework through implementation and experimentation on two open-source P2P systems. Through experimentation, we analyze the behavior of both systems on different conditions of volatility and show how the framework is able to detect implementation problems.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Montpellier", "LINA, Univ. de Nantes, Nantes", "LINA, Univ. de Nantes, Nantes"], "authors": ["Eduardo Cunha de Almeida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Almeida:Eduardo_Cunha_de", "Gerson Suny\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suny=eacute=:Gerson", "Yves Le Traon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traon:Yves_Le", "Patrick Valduriez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valduriez:Patrick"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
