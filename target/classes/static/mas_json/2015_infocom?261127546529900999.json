{"title": "SPIRO: Turning elephants into mice with efficient RF transport.", "fields": ["latency", "beamforming", "data stream", "access network", "data stream mining"], "abstract": "Cloud-RANs (Radio Access Networks) assume the existence of a high-capacity, low-delay/latency fronthaul to support cooperative transmission schemes such as CoMP (Coordinated Multi-Point) and coordinated beamforming. However, building such hierarchical wired fronthauls is challenging as the typical I/Q data stream is non-elastic \u2014 I/Q data over the wired fronthaul has little tolerance for delay jitters and zero tolerance for losses. Any distortion to the I/Q data stream will make the resulting wireless transmission completely unintelligible. We propose Spiro, a mechanism that efficiently transports RF signals over a wired fronthaul network. The primary goal of Spiro is to make I/Q data streams elastic and resilient to unexpected network condition changes. This is accomplished through a novel combination of compression and data prioritization of I/Q data on the wired fronthaul. For a given wireless throughput, Spiro can reduce the bandwidth demand of the fronthaul data stream by up to 50% without any noticeable degradation in the wireless reception quality. Further bandwidth reduction via compression and frame losses only have a limited impact on the wireless throughput.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "KAIST", "Hewlett-Packard", "Samsung"], "authors": ["Eugene Chai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chai:Eugene", "Kang G.
