A new feature which captures topics and their sentiments simultaneously is introduced in the prediction model. In addition, a new topic model TSLDA is proposed to obtain this feature. Our method outperformed a model using only historical prices by about 6.07% in accuracy. Furthermore, when comparing to other sentiment analysis methods, the accuracy of our method was also better than LDA and JST based methods by 6.43% and 6.07%. The results show that incorporation of the sentiment information from social media can help to improve the stock prediction.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Thien Hai Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Thien_Hai", "Kiyoaki Shirai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shirai:Kiyoaki"], "pages": 11}
