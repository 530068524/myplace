{"title": "How a General-Purpose Commonsense Ontology can Improve Performance of Learning-Based Image Retrieval.", "fields": ["visual reasoning", "deep learning", "commonsense knowledge", "testbed", "sentence"], "abstract": "The knowledge representation community has built general-purpose ontologies which contain large amounts of commonsense knowledge over relevant aspects of the world, including useful visual information, e.g.: \"a ball is used by a football player\", \"a tennis player is located at a tennis court\". Current state-of-the-art approaches for visual recognition do not exploit these rule-based knowledge sources. Instead, they learn recognition models directly from training examples. In this paper, we study how general-purpose ontologies---specifically, MIT's ConceptNet ontology---can improve the performance of state-of-the-art vision systems. As a testbed, we tackle the problem of sentence-based image retrieval. Our retrieval approach incorporates knowledge from ConceptNet on top of a large pool of object detectors derived from a deep learning technique. In our experiments, we show that ConceptNet can improve performance on a common benchmark dataset. Key to our performance is the use of the ESPGAME dataset to select visually relevant relations from ConceptNet. Consequently, a main conclusion of this work is that general-purpose commonsense ontologies improve performance on visual reasoning tasks when properly filtered to select meaningful visual relations.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Andr\u00e9s Bello National University"], "authors": ["Rodrigo Toro Icarte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Icarte:Rodrigo_Toro", "Jorge A.
