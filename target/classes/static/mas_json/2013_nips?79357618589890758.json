{"title": "On model selection consistency of penalized M-estimators: a geometric theory.", "fields": ["mathematics", "mathematical optimization", "geometric group theory", "model selection", "estimator"], "abstract": "Penalized M-estimators are used in diverse areas of science and engineering to fit high-dimensional models with some low-dimensional structure. Often, the penalties are \\emph{geometrically decomposable}, \\ie\\ can be expressed as a sum of (convex) support functions. We generalize the notion of irrepresentable to geometrically decomposable penalties and develop a general framework for establishing consistency and model selection consistency of M-estimators with such penalties. We then use this framework to derive results for some special cases of interest in bioinformatics and statistical learning.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Jason D.
