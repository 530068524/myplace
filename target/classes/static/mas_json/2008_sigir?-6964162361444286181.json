In this paper we address the problem of extracting question-answer pairs from forums. Question-answer pairs extracted from forums can be used to help Question Answering services (e.g. Yahoo! Answers) among other applications. We propose a sequential patterns based classification method to detect questions in a forum thread, and a graph based propagation method to detect answers for questions in the same thread. Experimental results show that our techniques are very promising.", "citation": "Citations (257)", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Tianjin University", "Microsoft", "Korea University", "Tianjin University"], "authors": ["Gao Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Gao", "Long Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Long", "Chin-Yew Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chin=Yew", "Young-In Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Young=In", "Yueheng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yueheng"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
