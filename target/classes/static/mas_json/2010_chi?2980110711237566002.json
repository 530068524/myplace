{"title": "Integrating Text with Video and 3D Graphics: The Effects of Text Drawing Styles on Text Readability.", "fields": ["shadow", "3d computer graphics", "legibility", "readability", "augmented reality"], "abstract": "There have been many studies of computer based text reading. However, only a few have considered text integrated with video and 3D graphics. This paper presents an investigation into the effects of varying (a) text drawing style (plain, billboard, Anti-Interference, shadow), (b) image polarity (positive and negative), and (c) background style (video and 3D) on text readability. Reading speed and accuracy were measured and subjective views of participants recorded.   Results showed that: (a) there was little difference in reading performance for the video and 3D backgrounds; (b) the negative presentation outperformed the positive presentation; (c) the billboard drawing styles supported the best performance; subjective comments showed a preference for the billboard style. We therefore suggest, for reading tasks, that designers of interfaces for games, video, and augmented reality provide billboard style to maximize readability for the widest range of applications.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["National University of Ireland, Galway", "National University of Ireland, Galway", "National University of Ireland, Galway", "National University of Ireland, Galway", "National University of Ireland, Galway"], "authors": ["Jacek Jankowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jankowski:Jacek", "Krystian Samp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samp:Krystian", "Izabela Irzynska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irzynska:Izabela", "Marek Jozwowicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jozwowicz:Marek", "Stefan Decker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Decker:Stefan"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
