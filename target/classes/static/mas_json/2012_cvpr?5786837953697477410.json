When applied to image analysis, these methods merely look on an n 1  \u00d7 n 2  image as a vector in R n1\u00d7n2  space and the pixels of the image are considered as independent. They fail to consider the fact that an image represented in the plane is intrinsically a matrix, and pixels spatially close to each other may probably be correlated. Even though we have n 1  \u00d7 n 2  pixels per image, this spatial correlation suggests the real number of freedom is far less. In this paper, we introduce a regularized metric learning framework, Two-Dimensional Smooth Metric Learning (2DSML), which uses a discretized Laplacian penalty to restrict the coefficients to be two-dimensional smooth. Many existing metric learning algorithms can fit into this framework and learn a spatially smooth metric which is better for image applications than their original version. Recognition, clustering and retrieval can be then performed based on the learned metric. Experimental results on benchmark image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "The State Key L ... g, China 310058", "The State Key L ... g, China 310058", "The State Key L ... g, China 310058"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xinlei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xinlei", "Zifei Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Zifei", "Haifeng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Haifeng", "Deng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Deng"], "pages": 6}
