{"title": "Tracking with Unreliable Node Sequences.", "fields": ["implementation", "optimal matching", "system deployment", "abstraction layer", "smoothing"], "abstract": "Tracking mobile targets using sensor networks is a challenging task because of the impacts of in-the-filed factors such as environment noise, sensing irregularity and etc. This paper proposes a robust tracking framework using node sequences, an ordered list extracted from unreliable sensor readings. Instead of estimating each position point separately in a movement trace, we convert the original tracking problem to the problem of finding the shortest path in a graph, which is equivalent to optimal matching of a series of node sequences. In addition to the basic design, multi- dimensional smoothing is developed to enhance tracking accuracy. Practical system deployment related issues are discussed in the paper, and the design is evaluated with both simulation and a system implementation using Pioneer III Robot and MICAz sensor nodes. In fact, tracking with node sequences provides a useful layer of abstraction, making the design framework generic and compatible with different physical sensing modalities.", "citation": "Citations (110)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Ziguo Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Ziguo", "Ting Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Ting", "Dan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Dan", "Tian He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Tian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
