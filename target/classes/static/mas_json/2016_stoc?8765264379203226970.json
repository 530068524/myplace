We analyze the minimal overhead that must be added by the coding scheme in order to succeed in performing the computation despite the noise. Our main result is a lower bound on the communication of any noise-resilient protocol over a synchronous star network with n-parties (where all parties communicate in every round). Specifically, we show a task that can be solved by communicating T bits over the noise-free network, but for which any protocol with success probability of 1-o(1) must communicate at least \u03a9(T log n / log log n) bits when the channels are noisy. By a 1994 result of Rajagopalan and Schulman, the slowdown we prove is the highest one can obtain on any topology, up to a log log n factor. We complete our lower bound with a matching coding scheme that achieves the same overhead; thus, the capacity of (synchronous) star networks is \u0398(log log n / log n). Our bounds prove that, despite several previous coding schemes with rate \u03a9(1) for certain topologies, no coding scheme with constant rate \u03a9(1) exists for arbitrary n-party noisy networks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Tel Aviv University", "Princeton University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Princeton University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Bar-Ilan University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Mark Braverman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braverman:Mark", "Klim Efremenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efremenko:Klim", "Ran Gelles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gelles:Ran", "Bernhard Haeupler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haeupler:Bernhard"], "pages": 12}
