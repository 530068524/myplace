Given black-box access to an *arbitrary* binary function f on the n-dimensional hypercube, our algorithm finds a function that agrees with f on almost (within an epsilon fraction) as many inputs as the best size-t decision tree, in time poly(n,t,1e).   This is the first polynomial-time algorithm for learning decision trees in a harsh noise model. We also give a *proper* agnostic learning algorithm for juntas, a sub-class of decision trees, again using membership queries.   Conceptually, the present paper parallels recent work towards agnostic learning of halfspaces (Kalai et al, 2005); algorithmically, it is more challenging. The core of our learning algorithm is a procedure to implicitly solve a convex optimization problem over the L 1  ball in 2 n  dimensions using an approximate gradient projection method.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Parikshit Gopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalan:Parikshit", "Adam Tauman Kalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalai:Adam_Tauman", "Adam R.
