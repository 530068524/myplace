Our comparison addresses a central question in the deployment of technology-assisted review: Should training documents be selected at random, or should they be selected using one or more non-random methods, such as keyword search or active learning? On eight review tasks -- four derived from the TREC 2009 Legal Track and four derived from actual legal matters -- recall was measured as a function of human review effort. The results show that entirely non-random training methods, in which the initial training documents are selected using a simple keyword search, and subsequent training documents are selected by active learning, require substantially and significantly less human review effort (P", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Wachtell, Lipto ... w York, NY, USA"], "authors": ["Gordon V.
