To capture the uncertainty and partial observability of the domain, we model this problem as a POMDP. However, the resulting model is computationally intractable and cannot be solved by most existing POMDP solvers due to the large state and action spaces. By exploiting the problem structure we propose a novel online planning algorithm to solve this model. Specifically, we generate plans for the responders based on Monte-Carlo simulations and compute actions for the UAVs according to the value of information. Our empirical results confirm that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art both in time and solution quality.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Southampton", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Feng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Feng", "Sarvapali D.
