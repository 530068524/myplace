We make three contributions: (1) we describe a simple power-down policy for exploiting low power modes of modern DRAMs; (2) we show how the idea of adaptive history-based memory schedulers can be naturally extended to manage power and energy; and (3) for situations in which additional DRAM power reduction is needed, we present a throttling approach that arbitrarily reduces DRAM activity by delaying the issuance of memory commands. Using detailed microarchitectural simulators of the IBM Power5+ and a DDR2-533 SDRAM, we show that our first two techniques combine to increase DRAM energy efficiency by an average of 18.2%, 21.7%, 46.1%, and 37.1% for the Stream, NAS, SPEC2006fp, and commercial benchmarks, respectively. We also show that our throttling approach provides performance that is within 4.4% of an idealized oracular approach.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "departments": ["IBM", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Ibrahim Hur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hur:Ibrahim", "Calvin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Calvin"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
