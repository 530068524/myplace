{"title": "Trust Models for RDF Data: Semantics and Complexity.", "fields": ["logical consequence", "rdf schema", "graph", "semantics", "rdf"], "abstract": "Due to the openness and decentralization of the Web, mechanisms to represent and reason about the reliability of RDF data become essential. This paper embarks on a formal analysis of RDF data enriched with trust information by focusing on the characterization of its model-theoretic semantics and on the study of relevant reasoning problems. The impact of trust values on the computational complexity of well-known concepts related to the entailment of RDF graphs is studied. In particular, islands of tractability are identified for classes of acyclic and nearly-acyclic graphs. Moreover, an implementation of the framework and an experimental evaluation on real data are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Calabria", "University of Calabria"], "authors": ["Valeria Fionda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fionda:Valeria", "Gianluigi Greco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greco:Gianluigi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
