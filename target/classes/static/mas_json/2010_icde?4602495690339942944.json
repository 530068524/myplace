Moreover, annotations may contradict each other and have uncertainty. Such situations result in a natural question: \u201cWhich opinion is most likely to be correct?\u201d In this paper, we define a credibility-enhanced curated database and propose an efficient method to accurately evaluate the correctness of sources and annotations in curated databases.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Qun Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Qun", "Elisa Bertino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertino:Elisa"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
