{"title": "20 petaflops simulation of proteins suspensions in crowding conditions.", "fields": ["parallel computing", "mathematical model", "crowding", "scalability", "architecture"], "abstract": "We present performance results for the simulation of proteins suspensions in crowding conditions obtained with  MUPHY , a computational platform for multi-scale simulations of real-life biofluidic problems. Previous versions of  MUPHY  have been used in the past for the simulation of blood flow through the human coronary arteries and DNA translocation across nanopores. The simulation exhibits excellent scalability up to 18, 000 K20X Nvidia GPUs and achieves almost 20 Petaflops of  aggregate sustained performance  with a peak performance of 27.5 Petaflops for the most intensive computing component. Those figures demonstrate once again the flexibility of  MUPHY  in simulating biofluidic phenomena, exploiting at their best the features of the architecture in use. Preliminary results were obtained in the present case on a completely different platform, the IBM Blue Gene/Q. The combination of novel mathematical models, computational algorithms, hardware technology, code tuning and parallelization techniques required to achieve these results are presented.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["IAC", "IAC", "Nvidia", "IAC"], "authors": ["Massimo Bernaschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bernaschi:Massimo", "Mauro Bisson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bisson:Mauro", "Massimiliano Fatica.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fatica:Massimiliano", "Simone Melchionna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melchionna:Simone"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2013", "pages": 11}
