Due to flows and waves, the sensor nodes may gradually lose their positions; leaving the points of interest uncovered. Manual readjustment is costly and cannot be performed in time. We argue that a network of mobile sensor nodes which can perform self-adjustment is the best candidate to maintain the coverage of the surface area. A key observation of our scheme is that the motion of the flows is not only a curse but should also be considered as a fortune. The sensor nodes can be pushed by free to some locations that potentially improve the overall coverage. To this end, we present a dominating set maintenance scheme to maximally exploit the uncontrollable mobility and balance the energy consumption among all the sensor nodes. We proved that the coverage is guaranteed in our scheme. The simulation demonstrates that the network lifetime can be significantly extended, compared to a straight forward back-to-original reposition scheme.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Ji Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Ji", "Dan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Dan", "Qian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
