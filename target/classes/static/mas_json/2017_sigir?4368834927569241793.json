We define controversy as a public discussion that divides society and demonstrate that a content and stylometric analysis of these debates yields useful signals for extracting disputed news items. Moreover, we argue that a debate-based approach could produce more generic models, since the discussion architectures we exploit to measure controversy occur on many different platforms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Kaspar Beelen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beelen:Kaspar", "Evangelos Kanoulas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanoulas:Evangelos", "Bob van de Velde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Velde:Bob_van_de"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
