Viewing keypoint sets associated with visual textures as realizations of point processes, we investigate probabilistic texture models from multivariate log-Gaussian Cox processes. These models are parameterized by the covariance structure of the spatial patterns. Their implementation initially rely on the construction of a codebook of the visual signatures of keypoints. We discuss invariance properties of the proposed models for texture recognition applications and report a quantitative evaluation for three texture datasets, namely: UIUC, KTH-TIPs and Brodatz. These experiments include a comparison of the performance reached using different methods for keypoint detection and characterization and demonstrate the relevance of the proposed models w.r.t. state-of-the-art methods. We further discuss the main contribution of proposed approach, including the key features of a statistical model and complexity aspects.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Bretagne", "\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Bretagne", "\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Bretagne"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Huu-Giao Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Huu=Giao", "Ronan Fablet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fablet:Ronan", "Jean-Marc Boucher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boucher:Jean=Marc"], "pages": 8}
