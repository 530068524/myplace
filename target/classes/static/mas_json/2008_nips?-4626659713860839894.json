We are interested in the problem of identifying those basis functions with non-zero coefficients and reconstructing the target function from noisy observations. Two heuristics that are widely used in practice are forward and backward greedy algorithms. First, we show that neither idea is adequate. Second, we propose a novel combination that is based on the forward greedy algorithm but takes backward steps adaptively whenever beneficial. We prove strong theoretical results showing that this procedure is effective in learning sparse representations. Experimental results support our theory.", "citation": "Citations (139)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Rutgers University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Tong"], "pages": 8}
