Robust optimization, which incorporates estimation error directly into the portfolio optimization process, is typically used with conventional robust statistical estimation methods. This perspective on the robust optimization approach reviews useful practical extensions and discusses potential applications for robust portfolio optimization.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University", "Babson College", "Intertek", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Princeton University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Deutsche Bank", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Babson College", "New York University", "EDHEC Business School", "Intertek", "Columbia University", "New York University", "Intertek", "Finance", "Invesco Global  ... tegies, Germany"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Huitong Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Huitong", "Fang Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Fang", "Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Han", "Brian Caffo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caffo:Brian"], "pages": 9}
