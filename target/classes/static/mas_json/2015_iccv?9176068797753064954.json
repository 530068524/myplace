Our method contains two main components -- i.e., SR draft ensemble generation and its optimal reconstruction. The first component is to renovate traditional feedforward reconstruction pipeline and greatly enhance its ability to compute different super resolution results considering large motion variation and possible errors arising in this process. Then we combine SR drafts through the nonlinear process in a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We analyze why this framework is proposed and explain its unique advantages compared to previous iterative methods to update different modules in passes. Promising experimental results are shown on natural video sequences.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Renjie Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Renjie", "Xin Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Xin", "Ruiyu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ruiyu", "Ziyang Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Ziyang", "Jiaya Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jiaya"], "pages": 9}
