Given an unknown distribution in {0,1} n  with support of size k, and given access only to noisy samples from it, where each bit is flipped independently with probability (1-\u03bc)/2, estimate the original probability up to an additive error of e. We give an algorithm which solves this problem in time polynomial in (k log log k , n, 1/e). This improves on the previous algorithm of Wigderson and Yehudayoff [FOCS 2012] which solves the problem in time polynomial in (k log k , n, 1/e). Our main technical contribution, which facilitates the algorithm, is a new reverse Bonami-Beckner inequality for the L 1  norm of sparse functions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar", "Jiapeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jiapeng"], "pages": 6}
