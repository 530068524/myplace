Our findings emphasize the importance of the temporality and spatiality of these tactical verbal communications (\"call-outs\"). From here, we outline potential designs to mitigate problems in the production/interpretation of call-outs to better support coordination.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Saskatchewan", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Anthony Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Anthony", "Jonathan Massey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massey:Jonathan", "Nelson Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Nelson", "Derek F.
