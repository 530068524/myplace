{"title": "Indoor-ALPS: an adaptive indoor location prediction system.", "fields": ["location based service", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Location prediction enables us to use a person's mobility history to realize various applications such as efficient temperature control, opportunistic meeting support, and automated receptionists. Indoor location prediction is a challenging problem, particularly due to a high density of possible locations and short transition distances between these locations. In this paper we present Indoor-ALPS, an Adaptive Indoor Location Prediction System that uses temporal-spatial features to create individual daily models for the prediction of when a user will leave their current location (transition time) and the next location she will transition to. We tested Indoor-ALPS on the Augsburg Indoor Location Tracking Benchmark and compared our approach to the best performing temporal-spatial mobility prediction algorithm, Prediction by Partial Match (PPM). Our results show that Indoor-ALPS improves the temporal-spatial prediction accuracy over PPM for look-aheads up to 90 minutes by 6.2%, and for up to 30 minute look-aheads by 10.7%. These results demonstrate that Indoor-ALPS can be used to support a wide variety of indoor mobility prediction-based applications.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Madeira", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Christian Koehler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koehler_0002:Christian", "Nikola Banovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banovic:Nikola", "Ian Oakley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oakley:Ian", "Jennifer Mankoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mankoff:Jennifer", "Anind K.
