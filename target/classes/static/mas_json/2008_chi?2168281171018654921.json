The Memory Aiding Prompting System (MAPS) provides an environment in which caregivers can create scripts that can be used by people with cognitive disabilities (\"clients\") to support them in carrying out tasks that they would not be able to achieve by themselves. To account for the great diversity among clients, MAPS was developed as a meta-design environment, empowering the caregivers to develop personalized prompting systems for the specific needs of individual clients.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Stefan Carmien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carmien:Stefan", "Gerhard Fischer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischer:Gerhard"], "pages": 10}
