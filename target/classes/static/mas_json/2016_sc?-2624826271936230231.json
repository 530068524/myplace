We have implemented nonlinearity using a Drucker-Prager yield condition in AWP-ODC and further optimized the CUDA kernels to more efficiently utilize the GPU's memory bandwidth. The application has resulted in a significant increase in the model region and accuracy for state-of-the-art earthquake simulations in a realistic earth structure, which are now able to resolve the wavefield at frequencies relevant for the most vulnerable buildings (> 1 Hz) while maintaining the scalability and efficiency of the method. We successfully run the code on 4,200 Kepler K20X GPUs on NCSA Blue Waters and OLCF Titan to simulate a M 7.7 earthquake on the southern San Andreas fault with a spatial resolution of 25 m for frequencies up to 4 Hz.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["San Diego State University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "San Diego State University", "San Diego State University", "San Diego State University"], "authors": ["Daniel Roten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roten:Daniel", "Yifeng Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Yifeng", "Kim B.
