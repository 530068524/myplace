In practice, software model checkers fail often and usually do not provide any information on what was effectively checked. The purpose of this work is to provide a conceptual framing to extend software model checkers in a way that allows users to access information about incomplete checks. We characterize the information that model checkers themselves can provide, in terms of analyzed traces, i.e. sequences of statements, and safe canes, and present the notion of execution reports (ERs), which we also formalize. We instantiate these concepts for a family of techniques based on Abstract Reachability Trees and implement the approach using the software model checker CPAchecker. We evaluate our approach empirically and provide examples to illustrate the ERs produced and the information that can be extracted.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National Scientific and Technical Research Council", "National Scientific and Technical Research Council", "National Scientific and Technical Research Council", "National Scientific and Technical Research Council"], "authors": ["Rodrigo Casta\u00f1o.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casta=ntilde=o:Rodrigo", "V\u00edctor A.
