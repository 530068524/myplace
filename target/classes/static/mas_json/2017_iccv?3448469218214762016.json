For training, we introduce the largest public light field dataset, consisting of over 3300 plenoptic camera light fields of scenes containing flowers and plants. Our synthesis pipeline consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that estimates scene geometry, a stage that renders a Lambertian light field using that geometry, and a second CNN that predicts occluded rays and non-Lambertian effects. Our algorithm builds on recent view synthesis methods, but is unique in predicting RGBD for each light field ray and improving unsupervised single image depth estimation by enforcing consistency of ray depths that should intersect the same scene point.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Pratul P.
