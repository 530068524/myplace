Existing approaches either maintain the exact shared read-write linkages with a large runtime overhead or use exponential off-line algorithms to search for a feasible interleaved execution. In this paper, we propose Stride, a hybrid solution that records the bounded shared memory access linkages at runtime and infers an equivalent interleaving in polynomial time, under the sequential consistency assumption. The recording scheme eliminates the need for synchronizing the shared read operations, which results in a significant overhead reduction. Comparing to the previous state-of-the-art approach of deterministic replay, Stride reduces, on average, 2.5 times of runtime overhead and produces, on average, 3.88 times smaller logs.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Jinguo Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Jinguo", "Xiao Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao_0003:Xiao", "Charles Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Charles"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 11}
