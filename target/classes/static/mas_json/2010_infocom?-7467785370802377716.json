We then propose a distributed Game Based Channel Assignment algorithm (GBCA) to solve the problem. GBCA takes into account both the network topology information and transmission routing information. We prove that there exists at least one Nash Equilibrium in the channel assignment game. Furthermore, we analyze the sub-optimality of Nash Equilibrium and the convergence of the Best Response in the game. Simulation results are given to demonstrate that GBCA can reduce interference significantly and achieve satisfactory network performance in terms of delivery ratio, throughput, channel access delay and energy consumption.", "citation": "Citations (115)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Qing Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Qing", "Jiming Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiming", "Yanfei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Yanfei", "Xuemin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xuemin", "Youxian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Youxian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
