{"title": "SoF: Soft-Cluster Matrix Factorization for Probabilistic Clustering.", "fields": ["correlation clustering", "axiomatic system", "non negative matrix factorization", "constrained clustering", "matrix decomposition"], "abstract": "We propose SoF (Soft-cluster matrix Factorization), a probabilistic clustering algorithm which softly assigns each data point into clusters. Unlike model-based clustering algorithms, SoF does not make assumptions about the data density distribution. Instead, we take an axiomatic approach to define 4 properties that the probability of co-clustered pairs of points should satisfy. Based on the properties, SoF utilizes a distance measure between pairs of points to induce the conditional co-cluster probabilities. The objective function in our framework establishes an important connection between probabilistic clustering and constrained symmetric Nonneg-ative Matrix Factorization (NMF), hence providing a theoretical interpretation for NMF-based clustering algorithms. To optimize the objective, we derive a sequential minimization algorithm using a penalty method. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that SoF significantly outperforms previous NMF-based algorithms and that it is able to detect non-convex patterns as well as cluster boundaries.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Tsinghua University", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Han Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Han", "Pascal Poupart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poupart:Pascal", "Yongfeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yongfeng", "Martin Lysy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lysy:Martin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
