{"title": "iTuned: a tool for configuring and visualizing database parameters.", "fields": ["adaptive sampling", "database tuning", "sql", "software portability", "executor"], "abstract": "iTuned  is a tool that takes a SQL workload as input and recommends good settings for database configuration parameters such as buffer pool sizes, multi-programming level, and number of I/O daemons. iTuned also provides response-surface and sensitivity-analysis plots that help the end-user analyze the impact of each parameter. iTuned has the following novel features: (i) a technique called Adaptive Sampling that proactively brings in appropriate data through planned  experiments  to find high-impact parameters and high-performance parameter settings, (ii) an executor that supports on-line experiments in production database environments through a cycle-stealing paradigm that places minimal overhead on the production workload, and (iii) portability across different database systems. This demonstration will focus on the interesting use-case scenarios of iTuned, and show the effectiveness of recommended configuration settings on popular database benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Vamsidhar Thummala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thummala:Vamsidhar", "Shivnath Babu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babu:Shivnath"], "pages": 4}
