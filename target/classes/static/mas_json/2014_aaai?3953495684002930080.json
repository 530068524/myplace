In this paper, we propose to use L2,p norm for feature selection with emphasis on small p. As p \u2192 0, feature selection becomes discrete feature selection problem. We provide two algorithms, proximal gradient algorithm and rank-one update algorithm, which is more efficient at large regularization \u03bb. We provide closed form solutions of the proximal operator at p = 0, 1/2. Experiments on real life datasets show that features selected at small p consistently outperform features selected at p = 1, the standard L2,1 approach and other popular feature selection methods.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "authors": ["Miao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Miao", "Chris H.
