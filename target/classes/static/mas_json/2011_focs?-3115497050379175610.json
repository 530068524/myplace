{"title": "Near Linear Lower Bound for Dimension Reduction in L1.", "fields": ["computational complexity theory", "binary logarithm", "linear programming", "dimensionality reduction", "distortion"], "abstract": "Given a set of $n$ points in $\\ell_{1}$, how many dimensions are needed to represent all pair wise distances within a specific distortion? This dimension-distortion tradeoff question is well understood for the $\\ell_{2}$ norm, where $O((\\log n)/\\epsilon^{2})$ dimensions suffice to achieve $1+\\epsilon$ distortion. In sharp contrast, there is a significant gap between upper and lower bounds for dimension reduction in $\\ell_{1}$. A recent result shows that distortion $1+\\epsilon$ can be achieved with $n/\\epsilon^{2}$ dimensions. On the other hand, the only lower bounds known are that distortion $\\delta$ requires $n^{\\Omega(1/\\delta^2)}$ dimensions and that distortion $1+\\epsilon$ requires $n^{1/2-O(\\epsilon \\log(1/\\epsilon))}$ dimensions. In this work, we show the first near linear lower bounds for dimension reduction in $\\ell_{1}$. In particular, we show that $1+\\epsilon$ distortion requires at least $n^{1-O(1/\\log(1/\\epsilon))}$ dimensions. Our proofs are combinatorial, but inspired by linear programming. In fact, our techniques lead to a simple combinatorial argument that is equivalent to the LP based proof of Brinkman-Charikar for lower bounds on dimension reduction in $\\ell_{1}$.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Alexandr Andoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andoni:Alexandr", "Moses Charikar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charikar:Moses", "Ofer Neiman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neiman:Ofer", "Huy L.
