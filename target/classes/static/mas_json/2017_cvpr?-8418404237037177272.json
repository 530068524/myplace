The problem is to input a single RGB image and generate a sequence of upcoming human body poses in 3D. To address the problem, we propose the 3D Pose Forecasting Network (3D-PFNet). Our 3D-PFNet integrates recent advances on single-image human pose estimation and sequence prediction, and converts the 2D predictions into 3D space. We train our 3D-PFNet using a three-step training strategy to leverage a diverse source of training data, including image and video based human pose datasets and 3D motion capture (MoCap) data. We demonstrate competitive performance of our 3D-PFNet on 2D pose forecasting and 3D structure recovery through quantitative and qualitative results.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Robotics Institute"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yu-Wei Chao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chao:Yu=Wei", "Jimei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jimei", "Brian L.
