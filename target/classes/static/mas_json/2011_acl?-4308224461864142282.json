Unlike other MBR methods that re-rank translations of a single SMT system, MBR system combination uses the MBR decision rule and a linear combination of the component systems' probability distributions to search for the minimum risk translation among all the finite-length strings over the output vocabulary. We introduce expected BLEU, an approximation to the BLEU score that allows to efficiently apply MBR in these conditions. MBR system combination is a general method that is independent of specific SMT models, enabling us to combine systems with heterogeneous structure. Experiments show that our approach bring significant improvements to single-system-based MBR decoding and achieves comparable results to different state-of-the-art system combination methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Instituto Tecno ... alencia, Spain", "D. de Sistemas  ... alencia, Spain", "D. de Sistemas  ... alencia, Spain"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez-Rubio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonz=aacute=lez=Rubio:Jes=uacute=s", "Alfons Juan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juan:Alfons", "Francisco Casacuberta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casacuberta:Francisco"], "pages": 10}
