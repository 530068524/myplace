In this work we describe how users work with paper-based affinity diagrams as uncovered through a set of interviews with professionals who use the method. We also present an early prototype system to provide computer support for paper-based affinities.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "University of Zurich", "University of Zurich"], "authors": ["Gunnar Harboe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harboe:Gunnar", "Jonas Minke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minke:Jonas", "Ioana Ilea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilea:Ioana", "Elaine M.
