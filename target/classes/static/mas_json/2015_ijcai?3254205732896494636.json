{"title": "Symbol Acquisition for Probabilistic High-Level Planning.", "fields": ["probability distribution", "symbol", "probabilistic logic", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We introduce a framework that enables an agent to autonomously learn its own symbolic representation of a low-level, continuous environment. Propositional symbols are formalized as names for probability distributions, providing a natural means of dealing with uncertain representations and probabilistic plans. We determine the symbols that are sufficient for computing the probability with which a plan will succeed, and demonstrate the acquisition of a symbolic representation in a computer game domain.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["George Konidaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konidaris:George", "Leslie Pack Kaelbling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaelbling:Leslie_Pack", "Tom\u00e1s Lozano-P\u00e9rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lozano=P=eacute=rez:Tom=aacute=s"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
