{"title": "A spatiotemporal visualization approach for the analysis of gameplay data.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "game mechanics", "information visualization", "game design", "analytical skill"], "abstract": "Contemporary video games are highly complex systems with many interacting variables. To make sure that a game provides a satisfying experience, a meaningful analysis of gameplay data is crucial, particularly because the quality of a game directly relates to the experience a user gains from playing it. Automatic instrumentation techniques are increasingly used to record data during playtests. However, the evaluation of the data requires strong analytical skills and experience. The visualization of such gameplay data is essentially an information visualization problem, where a large number of variables have to be displayed in a comprehensible way in order to be able to make global judgments. This paper presents a visualization tool to assist the analytical process. It visualizes the game space as a set of nodes which players visit over the course of a game and is also suitable to observe time-dependent information, such as player distribution. Our tool is not tailored to a specific type of genre. To show the flexibility of our approach we use two different kinds of games as case studies.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Applied Arts Vienna", "University of Vienna"], "authors": ["G\u00fcnter Wallner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wallner:G=uuml=nter", "Simone Kriglstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kriglstein:Simone"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
