Human action detection and recognition is one of the important tasks in this effort. In this paper, we present a luminance field manifold trajectory analysis based solution for human activity recognition, without explicit object level information extraction and understanding. This approach is computationally efficient and can operate in real time. The recognition performance is also comparable with the state of art in comparable set ups.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Zhu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Zhu", "Yun Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu_0001:Yun", "Thomas S.
