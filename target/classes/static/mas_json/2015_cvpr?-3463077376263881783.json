To better solve the partial occlusion issue, part-based methods are widely used in visual object trackers. However, due to the complicated online training and updating process, most of these part-based trackers cannot run in real-time. Correlation filters have been used in tracking tasks recently because of the high efficiency. However, the conventional correlation filter based trackers cannot deal with occlusion. Furthermore, most correlation filter based trackers fix the scale and rotation of the target which makes the trackers unreliable in long-term tracking tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking method which track objects based on parts with multiple correlation filters. Our method can run in real-time. Additionally, the Bayesian inference framework and a structural constraint mask are adopted to enable our tracker to be robust to various appearance changes. Extensive experiments have been done to prove the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (204)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "City University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0009:Ting", "Gang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0012:Gang", "Qingxiong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Qingxiong"], "pages": 11}
