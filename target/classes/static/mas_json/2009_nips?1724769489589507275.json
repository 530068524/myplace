{"title": "Kernel Methods for Deep Learning.", "fields": ["polynomial kernel", "radial basis function kernel", "tree kernel", "deep learning", "graph kernel"], "abstract": "We introduce a new family of positive-definite kernel functions that mimic the computation in large, multilayer neural nets. These kernel functions can be used in shallow architectures, such as support vector machines (SVMs), or in deep kernel-based architectures that we call multilayer kernel machines (MKMs). We evaluate SVMs and MKMs with these kernel functions on problems designed to illustrate the advantages of deep architectures. On several problems, we obtain better results than previous, leading benchmarks from both SVMs with Gaussian kernels as well as deep belief nets.", "citation": "Citations (230)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Youngmin Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Youngmin", "Lawrence K.
