Our primary goal is to design auctions that maximize social welfare and revenue -- two classical objectives in auction theory. For this purpose, we characterize envy-freeness with budgets by proving several elementary properties including consistency, monotonicity and transitivity. Based on this characterization, we come up with an envy-free auction, that is both social-optimal and bidder-optimal for a wide class of bidder types. More generally, for all bidder types, we provide two polynomial time approximation schemes (PTASs) for maximizing social welfare or revenue, where the notion of envy-freeness has been relaxed slightly. Finally, in cases where randomization is allowed in designing auctions, we devise similar PTASs for social welfare or revenue maximization problems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Liverpool", "University of Liverpool"], "authors": ["Bo Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Bo", "Jinshan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Jinshan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
