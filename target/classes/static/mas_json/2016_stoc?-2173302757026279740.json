We prove the first super-linear gate lower bounds and the first super-quadratic wire lower bounds for depth-two linear threshold circuits with arbitrary weights, and depth-three majority circuits computing an explicit function. (1) We prove that for all e \u226a \u221alog( n )/ n , the linear-time computable Andreev\u2019s function cannot be computed on a (1/2+e)-fraction of  n -bit inputs by depth-two circuits of  o (e 3   n  3/2 /log 3   n ) gates, nor can it be computed with  o (e 3   n  5/2 /log 7/2   n ) wires. This establishes an average-case \u201csize hierarchy\u201d for threshold circuits, as Andreev\u2019s function is computable by uniform depth-two circuits of  o ( n  3 ) linear threshold gates, and by uniform depth-three circuits of  O ( n ) majority gates. (2) We present a new function in  P  based on small-biased sets, which we prove cannot be computed by a majority vote of depth-two threshold circuits of  o ( n  3/2 /log 3   n ) gates, nor with  o ( n  5/2 /log 7/2  n ) wires. (3) We give tight average-case (gate and wire) complexity results for computing PARITY with depth-two threshold circuits; the answer turns out to be the same as for depth-two majority circuits. The key is a new method for analyzing random restrictions to linear threshold functions.
