{"title": "A Framework for Integrating Symbolic and Sub-Symbolic Representations.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "robot control", "cognitive robotics", "embedding", "architecture"], "abstract": "This paper establishes a framework that hierarchically integrates symbolic and sub-symbolic representations in an architecture for cognitive robotics. It is formalised abstractly as nodes in a hierarchy, with each node a sub-task that maintains its own belief-state and generates behaviour. An instantiation is developed for a real robot building towers of blocks, subject to human interference; this hierarchy uses a node with a concurrent multi-tasking teleo-reactive program, a node embedding a physics simulator to provide spatial knowledge, and nodes for sensor processing and robot control.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of Queensland"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Keith Clark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clark:Keith", "Bernhard Hengst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hengst:Bernhard", "Maurice Pagnucco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pagnucco:Maurice", "David Rajaratnam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajaratnam:David", "Peter Robinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robinson:Peter", "Claude Sammut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sammut:Claude", "Michael Thielscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thielscher:Michael"], "pages": 7}
