{"title": "CESI: Canonicalizing Open Knowledge Bases using Embeddings and Side Information.", "fields": ["feature engineering", "phrase", "open knowledge", "noun phrase", "canonicalization"], "abstract": "Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) methods extract (noun phrase, relation phrase, noun phrase) triples from text, resulting in the construction of large open Knowledge Bases (KBs). The noun phrases (NPs) and relation phrases in such open KBs are not canonicalized, leading to the storage of redundant and ambiguous facts. Recent research has posed canonicalization of open KBs as clustering over manually-defined feature spaces. Manual feature engineering is expensive and often sub-optimal. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose CESI \u2014 a novel approach which performs canonicalization over learned embeddings of Open KBs. CESI extends recent advances in KB embedding by incorporating relevant NP and relation phrase side information in a principled manner. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate CESI\u2019s effectiveness. We plan to make publicly available all the data and code used in the paper.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "Microsoft", "Indian Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Shikhar Vashishth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vashishth:Shikhar", "Prince Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Prince", "Partha Talukdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talukdar:Partha"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
