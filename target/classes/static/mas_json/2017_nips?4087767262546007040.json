By setting the truncation points appropriately, we are able to generate various types of nonlinearities within a unified framework, including sigmoid, tanh and ReLU, the most commonly used nonlinearities in neural networks. The framework readily integrates into existing stochastic neural networks (with hidden units characterized as random variables), allowing one for the first time to learn the nonlinearities alongside model weights in these networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance improvements brought about by the proposed framework when integrated with the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), temporal RBM and the truncated Gaussian graphical model (TGGM).", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Qinliang Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Qinliang", "Xuejun Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Xuejun", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "pages": 10}
