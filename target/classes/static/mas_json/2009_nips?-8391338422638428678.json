The problem arises in a variety of applications, from collaborative filtering (the 'Netflix problem') to structure-from-motion and positioning. We study a low complexity algorithm introduced by Keshavan, Montanari, and Oh (2010), based on a combination of spectral techniques and manifold optimization, that we call here OPTSPACE. We prove performance guarantees that are order-optimal in a number of circumstances.", "citation": "Citations (533)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Raghunandan H.
