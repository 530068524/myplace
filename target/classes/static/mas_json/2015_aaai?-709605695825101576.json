The size of the strategy space provides a computational challenge when solving these games. This complexity is tackled either by using the compact representation of sequential strategies and linear programming, or by incremental strategy generation of iterative double-oracle methods. In this paper, we present novel hybrid of these two approaches: compact-strategy double-oracle (CS-DO) algorithm that combines the advantages of the compact representation with incremental strategy generation. We experimentally compare CS-DO with the standard approaches and analyze the impact of the size of the support on the performance of the algorithms. Results show that CS-DO dramatically improves the convergence rate in games with non-trivial support.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Trinity University", "University of Southern California", "University of Texas at El Paso"], "authors": ["Branislav Bosansk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosansk=yacute=:Branislav", "Albert Xin Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Albert_Xin", "Milind Tambe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tambe:Milind", "Christopher Kiekintveld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiekintveld:Christopher"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
