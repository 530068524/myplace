{"title": "Moving into a new software project landscape.", "fields": ["software development", "heuristic", "grounded theory", "project management", "software"], "abstract": "When developers join a software development project, they find themselves in a  project landscape , and they must become familiar with the various landscape features. To better understand the nature of project landscapes and the integration process, with a view to improving the experience of both newcomers and the people responsible for orienting them, we performed a grounded theory study with 18 newcomers across 18 projects. We identified the main features that characterize a project landscape, together with key orientation aids and obstacles, and we theorize that there are three primary factors that impact the integration experience of newcomers: early experimentation, internalizing structures and cultures, and progress validation.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "departments": ["McGill University", "IBM", "IBM", "McGill University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Dagenais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dagenais:Barth=eacute=l=eacute=my", "Harold Ossher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ossher:Harold", "Rachel K.
