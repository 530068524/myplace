{"title": "Optimal mean-based algorithms for trace reconstruction.", "fields": ["polynomial", "binary logarithm", "deletion channel", "mathematical proof", "string"], "abstract": "In the (deletion-channel) trace reconstruction problem, there is an unknown  n -bit source string  x . An algorithm is given access to independent \u00e2  traces\u00e2   of  x , where a trace is formed by deleting each bit of  x  independently with probability I\ufffd. The goal of the algorithm is to recover  x  exactly (with high probability), while minimizing samples (number of traces) and running time.   Previously, the best known algorithm for the trace reconstruction problem was due to Holenstein et al. [HMPW08]; it uses exp( O ( n  1/2 )) samples and running time for any fixed 0  n  I\u00a9(log n )  samples.   In this paper we improve both of these results, obtaining matching upper and lower bounds for mean-based trace reconstruction. For any constant deletion rate 0  O ( n  1/3 )) time and traces; we also prove that any mean-based algorithm must use at least exp(I\u00a9( n  1/3 )) traces.   In fact, we obtain matching upper and lower bounds even for I\ufffd subconstant and \ufffd  1\u00e2  I\ufffd subconstant: when (log 3   n )/ n  \u00e2 \ufffd I\ufffd \u00e2 \ufffd 1/2 the bound is exp(\u00e2  I (I\ufffd  n ) 1/3 ), and when 1/\u00e2   n  \u00e2 \ufffd \ufffd  \u00e2 \ufffd 1/2 the bound is exp(\u00e2  I ( n /\ufffd ) 1/3 ).   Our proofs involve estimates for the maxima of Littlewood polynomials on complex disks. We show that these techniques can also be used to perform trace reconstruction with random insertions and bit-flips in addition to deletions. We also find a surprising result: for deletion probabilities I\ufffd > 1/2, the presence of insertions can actually help with trace reconstruction.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anindya De.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/De:Anindya", "Ryan O'Donnell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Donnell:Ryan", "Rocco A.
