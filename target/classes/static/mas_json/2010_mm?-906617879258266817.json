The video content for the system is generated by an adaptation of forefront video summarisation techniques that decompose the video into a number of Logical Story Units (LSU) representing sequences of contiguous and interconnected shots sharing a common semantic thread. Alternative storylines are generated using AI Planning techniques and these are used to direct the combination of elementary LSU for output. We report early results from experiments with the prototype in which the reordering of video shots on the basis of their high-level semantics produces trailers giving the illusion of different storylines.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Teesside University", "University of Brescia", "University of Brescia", "Teesside University", "Teesside University"], "authors": ["Julie Porteous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Porteous:Julie", "Sergio Benini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benini:Sergio", "Luca Canini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canini:Luca", "Fred Charles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charles:Fred", "Marc Cavazza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cavazza:Marc", "Riccardo Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Riccardo"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
