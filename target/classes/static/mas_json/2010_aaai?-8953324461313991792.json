{"title": "Envy Quotes and the Iterated Core-Selecting Combinatorial Auction.", "fields": ["auction theory", "revenue equivalence", "auction algorithm", "combinatorial auction", "vickrey clarke groves auction"], "abstract": "Using a model of agent behavior based around envy-reducing strategies, we describe an iterated combinatorial auction in which the allocation and prices converge to a solution in the core of the agents' true valuations. In each round of the iterative auction mechanism, agents act on envy quotes produced by the mechanism: hints that suggest the prices of the bundles they are interested in. We describe optimal methods of generating envy quotes for two different core-selecting mechanisms. Prior work on core-selecting combinatorial auctions has required agents to have perfect information about every agent's valuations to achieve a solution in the core. In contrast, here a core solution is reached even in the private information setting.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Abraham Othman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Othman:Abraham", "Tuomas Sandholm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sandholm:Tuomas"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
