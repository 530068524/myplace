{"title": "Extracting Social Networks from Literary Fiction.", "fields": ["literary fiction", "chunking", "direct speech", "metadata", "conversation"], "abstract": "We present a method for extracting social networks from literature, namely, nineteenth-century British novels and serials. We derive the networks from dialogue interactions, and thus our method depends on the ability to determine when two characters are in conversation. Our approach involves character name chunking, quoted speech attribution and conversation detection given the set of quotes. We extract features from the social networks and examine their correlation with one another, as well as with metadata such as the novel's setting. Our results provide evidence that the majority of novels in this time period do not fit two characterizations provided by literacy scholars. Instead, our results suggest an alternative explanation for differences in social networks.", "citation": "Citations (179)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["David K.
