Recently, this has led to study of the language grounding problem, where the goal is to extract representations of the meanings of natural language tied to the physical world. We present an approach for joint learning of language and perception models for grounded attribute induction. The perception model includes classifiers for physical characteristics and a language model based on a probabilistic categorial grammar that enables the construction of compositional meaning representations. We evaluate on the task of interpreting sentences that describe sets of objects in a physical workspace, and demonstrate accurate task performance and effective latent-variable concept induction in physical grounded scenes.", "citation": "Citations (195)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Cynthia Matuszek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matuszek:Cynthia", "Nicholas FitzGerald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/FitzGerald:Nicholas", "Luke S.
