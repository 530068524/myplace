Different from the famous robust principal component analysis (RPCA), we suggest recovering low-rank and sparse matrices via a nonconvex loss function and a nonconvex penalty. The advantage of the nonconvex approach lies in its stronger robustness. To solve the model, we devise a majorization-minimization augmented Lagrange multiplier (MM-ALM) algorithm which finds the local optimal solutions of the proposed nonconvex model. We also provide an efficient strategy to speedup MM-ALM, which makes the running time comparable with the state-of-the-art algorithm of solving RPCA. Finally, empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our nonconvex approach over RPCA in terms of matrix recovery accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Shusen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shusen", "Dehua Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Dehua", "Zhihua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhihua"], "pages": 7}
