{"title": "A Muddle of Models of Motivation for Using Peer-to-Peer Economy Systems.", "fields": ["service provider", "user experience design", "sustainability", "sharing economy", "peer to peer"], "abstract": "This paper reports on a study of motivations for the use of peer-to-peer or sharing economy services. We interviewed both users and providers of these systems to obtain different perspectives and to determine if providers are matching their system designs to the most important drivers of use. We found that the motivational models implicit in providers' explanations of their systems' designs do not match well with what really seems to motivate users. Providers place great emphasis on idealistic motivations such as creating a better community and increasing sustainability. Users, on the other hand are looking for services that provide what they need whilst increasing value and convenience. We discuss the divergent models of providers and users and offer design implications for peer system providers.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "PARC", "PARC", "PARC", "PARC"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Victoria Bellotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellotti:Victoria", "Alexander Ambard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ambard:Alexander", "Daniel Turner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turner:Daniel", "Christina Gossmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gossmann:Christina", "Kamila Demkova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demkova:Kamila", "John M.
