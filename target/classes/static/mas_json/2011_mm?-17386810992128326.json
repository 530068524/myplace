Effective evaluation of system performance is becoming critical, which will serve as an important instrument for service providers to monitor and manage quality. Recently, Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics are found to be more valuable quality assessment mechanism since they are more closely related to human perception as compared to traditional QoS-based techniques. In this paper, we investigate a new affect-based approach for QoE evaluation. Our hypothesis states that QoE in voice communication is correlated to user's affective behavior, which will vary across networking conditions. We conduct extensive user study based on natural human-human voice communication. The experimental results indicate very promising prospect of this approach.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Florida International University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Florida International University"], "authors": ["Abhishek Bhattacharya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhattacharya:Abhishek", "Wanmin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Wanmin", "Zhenyu Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhenyu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
