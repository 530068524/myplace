Here we show that a general form of the Gaussian Integral Trick makes it possible to transform a wide class of discrete variable undirected models into fully continuous systems. The continuous representation allows the use of gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference, results in new ways of estimating normalization constants (partition functions), and in general opens up a number of new avenues for inference in difficult discrete systems. We demonstrate some of these continuous relaxation inference algorithms on a number of illustrative problems.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Cambridge", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Yichuan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yichuan", "Charles A.
