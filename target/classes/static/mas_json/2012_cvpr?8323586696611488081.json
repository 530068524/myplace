We generalize to surfaces the polar sampling of the image domain used in shape contexts: for this purpose, we chart the surface by shooting geodesic outwards from the point being analyzed; \u2018angle\u2019 is treated as tantamount to geodesic shooting direction, and radius as geodesic distance. To deal with orientation ambiguity, we exploit properties of the Fourier transform. Our charting method is intrinsic, i.e., invariant to isometric shape transformations. The resulting descriptor is a meta-descriptor that can be applied to any photometric or geometric property field defined on the shape, in particular, we can leverage recent developments in intrinsic shape analysis and construct ISC based on state-of-the-art dense shape descriptors such as heat kernel signatures. Our experiments demonstrate a notable improvement in shape matching on standard benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "University of Lugano", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Iasonas Kokkinos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kokkinos:Iasonas", "Michael M.
