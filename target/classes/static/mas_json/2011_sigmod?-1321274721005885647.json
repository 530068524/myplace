{"title": "Automatic discovery of attributes in relational databases.", "fields": ["semi structured model", "database normalization", "information schema", "superkey", "database schema"], "abstract": "In this work we design algorithms for clustering relational columns into  attributes , i.e., for identifying strong relationships between columns based on the common properties and characteristics of the values they contain. For example, identifying whether a certain set of columns refers to  telephone  numbers versus  social security  numbers, or names of  customers  versus names of  nations . Traditional relational database schema languages use very limited primitive data types and simple foreign key constraints to express relationships between columns. Object oriented schema languages allow the definition of custom data types; still, certain relationships between columns might be unknown at design time or they might appear only in a particular database instance. Nevertheless, these relationships are an invaluable tool for schema matching, and generally for better understanding and working with the data. Here, we introduce data oriented solutions (we do not consider solutions that assume the existence of any external knowledge) that use statistical measures to identify strong relationships between the values of a set of columns. Interpreting the database as a graph where nodes correspond to database columns and edges correspond to column relationships, we decompose the graph into connected components and cluster sets of columns into attributes. To test the quality of our solution, we also provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation using real and synthetic datasets.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "AT&T Labs", "National University of Singapore", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Meihui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Meihui", "Marios Hadjieleftheriou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hadjieleftheriou:Marios", "Beng Chin Ooi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ooi:Beng_Chin", "Cecilia M.
