{"title": "Towards Automating Class-Splitting Using Betweenness Clustering.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "extract class", "turned a", "betweenness centrality", "code refactoring"], "abstract": "Large, unwieldy classes are a significant maintenance problem. Programmers dislike them because the fundamental logic is often obscured, making them hard to understand and modify. This paper proposes a solution - a semi-automatic technique for splitting large classes into smaller, more cohesive ones. The core of the technique is the use of betweenness clustering to identify the best way of partitioning a class. This turned a tedious manual process into a quick and simple semi-automated one in roughly one third of the cases we examined.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Victoria University of Wellington", "Victoria University of Wellington", "Victoria University of Wellington", "Victoria University of Wellington"], "authors": ["Keith Cassell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cassell:Keith", "Peter Andreae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andreae:Peter", "Lindsay Groves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Groves:Lindsay", "James Noble.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noble_0001:James"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
