{"title": "VulSeeker: a semantic learning based vulnerability seeker for cross-platform binary.", "fields": ["software development", "code reuse", "binary function", "basic block", "binary search algorithm"], "abstract": "Code reuse improves software development efficiency, however, vulnerabilities can be introduced inadvertently. Many existing works compute the code similarity based on CFGs to determine whether a binary function contains a known vulnerability. Unfortunately, their performance in cross-platform binary search is challenged.     This paper presents VulSeeker, a semantic learning based vulnerability seeker for cross-platform binary. Given a target function and a vulnerable function, VulSeeker first constructs the labeled semantic flow graphs and extracts basic block features as numerical vectors for both of them. Then the embedding vector of the whole binary function is generated by feeding the numerical vectors of basic blocks to the customized semantics aware DNN model. Finally, the similarity of the two binary functions is measured based on the Cosine distance. The experimental results show that VulSeeker outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy. For example, compared to the most recent and related work Gemini, VulSeeker finds 50.00% more vulnerabilities in the top-10 candidates and 13.89% more in the top-50 candidates, and improves the values of AUC and ACC for 8.23% and 12.14% respectively.
