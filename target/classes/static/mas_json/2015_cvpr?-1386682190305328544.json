Training SSVMs, however, is computationally costly, because it requires repeated calls to a structured prediction subroutine (called max-oracle), which has to solve an optimization problem itself, e.g. a graph cut.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Neel Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Neel", "Vladimir Kolmogorov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolmogorov:Vladimir", "Christoph H.
