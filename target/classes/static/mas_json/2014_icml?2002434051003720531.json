This includes several randomized and deterministic algorithms devised by converting on-line learning algorithms to batch ones, and a boosting-style algorithm applicable in the context of structured prediction with a large number of labels. We give a detailed study of all these algorithms, including the description of new on-line-to-batch conversions and learning guarantees. We also report the results of extensive experiments with these algorithms in several structured prediction tasks.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Google", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Corinna Cortes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cortes:Corinna", "Vitaly Kuznetsov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuznetsov:Vitaly", "Mehryar Mohri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohri:Mehryar"], "pages": 9}
