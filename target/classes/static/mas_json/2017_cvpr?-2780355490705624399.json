Existing learning-based binary descriptors such as compact binary face descriptor (CBFD) and DeepBit utilize the rigid sign function for binarization despite of data distributions, thereby suffering from severe quantization loss. In order to address the limitation, our DBD-MQ considers the binarization as a multi-quantization task. Specifically, we apply a K-AutoEncoders (KAEs) network to jointly learn the parameters and the binarization functions under a deep learning framework, so that discriminative binary descriptors can be obtained with a fine-grained multi-quantization. Extensive experimental results on different visual analysis including patch retrieval, image matching and image retrieval show that our DBD-MQ outperforms most existing binary feature descriptors.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yueqi Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Yueqi", "Jiwen Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Jiwen", "Ziwei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ziwei", "Jianjiang Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jianjiang", "Jie Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Jie"], "pages": 10}
