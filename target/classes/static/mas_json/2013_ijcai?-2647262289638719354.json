We investigate the effectiveness of the financial reporting process at restraining earnings surprise games. Because the annual reporting process is subject to an independent audit and more rigorous expense recognition rules than interim reporting, it provides managers with fewer opportunities to manage earnings upward. We document that, relative to interim reporting, annual reporting reduces the likelihood of income-increasing earnings management and, to a lesser extent, of negative surprise avoidance, but increases the magnitude of downward expectations management. Our findings suggest that regulatory attempts to monitor corporations' internal checks and balances are likely to be more effective at curbing upward earnings management than at mitigating negative surprise avoidance.", "citation": "Citations (189)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Georgia State University", "Georgia State University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Google", "Royal Holloway, University of London", "Royal Holloway, University of London", "Northwick Park Hospital", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Southern California", "Google", "Google", "Williams Electr ... .
