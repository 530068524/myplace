We focus on machine learning-based approaches to CLIR that need large sets of relevance-ranked data to train high-dimensional models. We compare these models under various measures of orthogonality, and present an experimental evaluation on two different domains (patents, Wikipedia) and two different language pairs (Japanese-English, German-English). We show that gains of over 10 points in MAP/NDCG can be achieved over the best single model by a linear combination of the models that contribute the most orthogonal information, rather than by combining the models with the best standalone retrieval performance.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University"], "authors": ["Shigehiko Schamoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schamoni:Shigehiko", "Stefan Riezler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riezler:Stefan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
