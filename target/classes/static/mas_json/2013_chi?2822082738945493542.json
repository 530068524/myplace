Synthesizing findings from several previous research studies of digital volunteerism, this paper offers a new approach for conceptualizing the activities of digital volunteers, shifting from a focus on organizing to a focus on information movement. Using the lens of distributed cognition, this research describes collective intelligence as transformations of information within a system where cognition is distributed socially across individuals as well as through their tools and resources. This paper demonstrates how digital volunteers, through activities such as relaying, amplifying, verifying, and structuring information, function as a collectively intelligent cognitive system in the wake of disaster events.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Washington"], "authors": ["Kate Starbird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Starbird:Kate"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
