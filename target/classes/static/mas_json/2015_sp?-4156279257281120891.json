{"title": "Using Hardware Features for Increased Debugging Transparency.", "fields": ["malware analysis", "malware", "breakpoint", "virtualization", "system management mode"], "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of malware attacks on the Internet, understanding these malicious behaviors plays a critical role in crafting effective defense. Advanced malware analysis relies on virtualization or emulation technology to run samples in a confined environment, and to analyze malicious activities by instrumenting code execution. However, virtual machines and emulators inevitably create artifacts in the execution environment, making these approaches vulnerable to detection or subversion. In this paper, we present MALT, a debugging framework that employs System Management Mode, a CPU mode in the x86 architecture, to transparently study armored malware. MALT does not depend on virtualization or emulation and thus is immune to threats targeting such environments. Our approach reduces the attack surface at the software level, and advances state-of-the-art debugging transparency. MALT embodies various debugging functions, including register/memory accesses, breakpoints, and four stepping modes. We implemented a prototype of MALT on two physical machines, and we conducted experiments by testing an array of existing anti-virtualization, anti-emulation, and packing techniques against MALT. The experimental results show that our prototype remains transparent and undetected against the samples. Furthermore, our prototype of MALT introduces moderate but manageable overheads on both Windows and Linux platforms.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["George Mason University", "University of Virginia", "George Mason University", "University of Delaware", "George Mason University"], "authors": ["Fengwei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Fengwei", "Kevin Leach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leach:Kevin", "Angelos Stavrou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stavrou:Angelos", "Haining Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haining", "Kun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Kun"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2015", "pages": 15}
