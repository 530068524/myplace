{"title": "idMesh: graph-based disambiguation of linked data.", "fields": ["linked data", "constraint satisfaction", "data web", "weak entity", "entity relationship model"], "abstract": "We tackle the problem of disambiguating entities on the Web. We propose a user-driven scheme where graphs of entities -- represented by globally identifiable declarative artifacts -- self-organize in a dynamic and probabilistic manner. Our solution has the following two desirable properties: i) it lets end-users freely define associations between arbitrary entities and ii) it probabilistically infers entity relationships based on uncertain links using constraint-satisfaction mechanisms. We outline the interface between our scheme and the current data Web, and show how higher-layer applications can take advantage of our approach to enhance search and update of information relating to online entities. We describe a decentralized infrastructure supporting efficient and scalable entity disambiguation and demonstrate the practicability of our approach in a deployment over several hundreds of machines.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Passau"], "authors": ["Philippe Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cudr=eacute==Mauroux:Philippe", "Parisa Haghani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haghani:Parisa", "Michael Jost.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jost_0003:Michael", "Karl Aberer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aberer:Karl", "Hermann de Meer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meer:Hermann_de"], "conf": "www", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
