Unlike past work that has focused on diversifying the output of the decoder at word-level to alleviate this problem, we present a novel framework based on conditional variational autoencoders that captures the discourse-level diversity in the encoder. Our model uses latent variables to learn a distribution over potential conversational intents and generates diverse responses using only greedy decoders. We have further developed a novel variant that is integrated with linguistic prior knowledge for better performance. Finally, the training procedure is improved by introducing a bag-of-word loss. Our proposed models have been validated to generate significantly more diverse responses than baseline approaches and exhibit competence in discourse-level decision-making.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Tiejun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Tiejun", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming", "Furu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Furu", "Nan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Nan", "Shaohan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Shaohan", "Qingyu Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Qingyu"], "pages": 10}
