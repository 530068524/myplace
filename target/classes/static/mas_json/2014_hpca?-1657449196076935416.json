{"title": "Improving in-memory database index performance with Intel", "fields": ["synchronization", "transactional synchronization extensions", "thread", "sap hana", "in memory database"], "abstract": "The increasing number of cores every generation poses challenges for high-performance in-memory database systems. While these systems use sophisticated high-level algorithms to partition a query or run multiple queries in parallel, they also utilize low-level synchronization mechanisms to synchronize access to internal database data structures. Developers often spend significant development and verification effort to improve concurrency in the presence of such synchronization. The Intel \u00ae  Transactional Synchronization Extensions (Intel \u00ae  TSX) in the 4th Generation Core\u2122 Processors enable hardware to dynamically determine whether threads actually need to synchronize even in the presence of conservatively used synchronization. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of such hardware support in a commercial database. We focus on two index implementations: a B+Tree Index and the Delta Storage Index used in the SAP HANA \u00ae  database system. We demonstrate that such support can improve performance of database data structures such as index trees and presents a compelling opportunity for the development of simpler, scalable, and easy-to-verify algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "SAP AG, Databas ... lldorf, Germany"], "authors": ["Tomas Karnagel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karnagel:Tomas", "Roman Dementiev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dementiev:Roman", "Ravi Rajwar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajwar:Ravi", "Konrad Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Konrad", "Thomas Legler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Legler:Thomas", "Benjamin Schlegel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schlegel:Benjamin", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
