Directly up-sampling a video without considering noise could deteriorate its visual quality due to magnifying noise. This paper addresses this problem with a unified framework that achieves simultaneous de-noising and super-resolution. This framework formulates noisy video super-resolution as an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the visual quality of the result. We consider a good quality result to be fidelity-preserving, detail-preserving and smooth. Accordingly, we propose measures for these qualities in the scenario of de-noising and super-resolution. The experiments on a variety of noisy videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... ertino, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Feng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0015:Feng", "Jinjun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jinjun", "Shenghuo Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Shenghuo", "Michael Gleicher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gleicher:Michael", "Yihong Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Yihong"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
