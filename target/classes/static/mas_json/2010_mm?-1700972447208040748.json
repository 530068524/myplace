{"title": "Mobile video browsing and retrieval with the OVIDIUS platform.", "fields": ["uncompressed video", "non linear editing system", "microsoft video 1", "smacker video", "video compression picture types"], "abstract": "This paper describes a mobile video browsing and retrievalapproach, based on the so-called OVIDIUS (On-line VIDeo Indexing Universal System) platform. In contrast with traditional and commercial video retrieval platforms, where video content is treated in a more or less monolithic manner (i.e. with global descriptions associated with the whole document), the proposed approach makes it possible to browse and access video content in a finer, per-segment basis. The hierarchical metadata structure exploits the MPEG-7 approach for structural description of video content. The MPEG-7 description schemes have been here enriched with both semantic and content-based metadata. The developed approach shows all its pertinence within a multiterminal context and in particular for video access from mobile devices. The platform has been recently (February, 2010) validated within the framework of the Medi@TIC French national project.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Telecom SudParis", "Telecom SudParis", "Mines ParisTech"], "authors": ["Andrei Bursuc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bursuc:Andrei", "Titus B.
