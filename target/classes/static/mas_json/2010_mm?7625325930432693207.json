In this paper, we present a topologically sorted classifier chain method for learning images with multi-label. We first provide a means of generating a topo-logically sorted label chain ordering by employing a topological sort algorithm and then apply the chain ordering to the classifier chain model proposed by [1] to classify multi-label images. Our method can capture the correlations between labels very effectively due to the sorted label chain ordering and the advantages brought by classifier chain method. We evaluate the proposed method on Corel dataset and demonstrate the micro and macro F1 measures superior to the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Xi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xi", "Zhiping Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Zhiping", "Zhixin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhixin", "Xishun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xishun", "Zhongzhi Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Zhongzhi"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
