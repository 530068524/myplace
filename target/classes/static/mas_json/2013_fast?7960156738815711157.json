Most implementations of Galois Field arithmetic rely on multiplication tables or discrete logarithms to perform this operation. However, the advent of 128-bit instructions, such as Intel's Streaming SIMD Extensions, allows us to perform Galois Field arithmetic much faster. This short paper details how to leverage these instructions for various field sizes, and demonstrates the significant performance improvements on commodity microprocessors. The techniques that we describe are available as open source software.", "citation": "Citations (113)", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "EMC Backup Reco ... stems Division"], "authors": ["James S.
