{"title": "Protein Structure Prediction on the Face Centered Cubic Lattice by Local Search.", "fields": ["self avoiding walk", "protein structure prediction", "initialization", "fitness function", "exact algorithm"], "abstract": "Ab initio protein structure prediction is an important problem for which several algorithms have been developed. Algorithms differ by how they represent 3D protein conformations (on-lattice, off-lattice, coarse-grain or fine-grain model), by the energy model they consider, and whether they are heuristic or exact algorithms. This paper presents a local search algorithm to find the native state for the Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model on the Face Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice; i.e. a self-avoiding walk on the FCC lattice with maximum number of H-H contacts. The algorithm relies on a randomized, structured initialization, a novel fitness function to guide the search, and efficient data structures to obtain self-avoiding walks. Experimental results on benchmark instances show the efficiency and excellent performance of our algorithm, and illustrate the biological pertinence of the FCC lattice.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University", "Boston College"], "authors": ["Manuel Cebri\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cebri=aacute=n:Manuel", "Iv\u00e1n Dot\u00fa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dot=uacute=:Iv=aacute=n", "Pascal Van Hentenryck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hentenryck:Pascal_Van", "Peter Clote.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clote:Peter"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
