Structured data is useful for computer system, however defining structure of knowledge for representing data semantics is usually a costly and time consuming task. In general, data structures are constructed by experts of knowledge engineering. Our method aims to construct not only structured data but also structure of data collaboratively by simple user input.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "National Institute of Informatics"], "authors": ["Masahiro Hamasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamasaki:Masahiro", "Masataka Goto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goto:Masataka", "Hideaki Takeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takeda_0001:Hideaki"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
