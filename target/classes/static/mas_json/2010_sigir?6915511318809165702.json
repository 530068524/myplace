{"title": "Ranking for the conversion funnel.", "fields": ["ranking", "funnel", "share of voice", "contextual advertising", "online advertising"], "abstract": "In contextual advertising advertisers show ads to users so that they will click on them and eventually purchase a product. Optimizing this action sequence, called the conversion funnel, is the ultimate goal of advertising. Advertisers, however, often have very different sub-goals for their ads such as purchase, request for a quote, or simply a site visit. Often an improvement for one advertiser's goal comes at the expense of others. A single ranking function must balance these different goals in order to make an efficient system for all advertisers. We propose a ranking method that globally balances the goals of all advertisers, while simultaneously improving overall performance. Our method has been shown to improve significantly over the baseline in online traffic at a major ad network.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Abraham Bagherjeiran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagherjeiran:Abraham", "Andrew O.
