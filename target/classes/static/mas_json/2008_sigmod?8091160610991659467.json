{"title": "Handling data skew in parallel joins in shared-nothing systems.", "fields": ["parallel database", "shared nothing architecture", "scalability", "concurrency", "data warehouse"], "abstract": "Parallel processing continues to be important in large data warehouses. The processing requirements continue to expand in multiple dimensions. These include greater volumes, increasing number of concurrent users, more complex queries, and more applications which define complex logical, semantic, and physical data models. Shared nothing parallel database management systems [16] can scale up \"horizontally\" by adding more nodes. Most parallel algorithms, however, do not take into account data skew. Data skew occurs naturally in many applications. A query processing skewed data not only slows down its response time, but generates hot nodes, which become a bottleneck throttling the overall system performance. Motivated by real business problems, we propose a new join geography called PRPD (Partial Redistribution & Partial Duplication) to improve the performance and scalability of parallel joins in the presence of data skew in a shared-nothing system. Our experimental results show that PRPD significantly speeds up query elapsed time in the presence of data skew. Our experience shows that eliminating system bottlenecks caused by data skew improves the throughput of the whole system which is important in parallel data warehouses that often run high concurrency workloads.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Teradata", "Teradata", "Teradata", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yu", "Pekka Kostamaa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostamaa:Pekka", "Xin Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xin", "Liang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Liang"], "pages": 10}
