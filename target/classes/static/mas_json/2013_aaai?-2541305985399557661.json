The model is given by y[n] = Ax s [n], 1 \u22c4 n \u22c4 L where {y[n]} n=1  L  denote the L measurement vectors, A \u2208 R M\u00d7N  is the measurement matrix and x s [n] \u2208 R N  are the unknown vectors with same sparsity support denoted by the set S 0  with |S 0 | = D. It has been shown in a recent paper by the authors that when the elements of x s [n] are uncorrelated from each other, one can recover sparsity levels as high as O(M 2 ) for suitably designed measurement matrix. This result was shown assuming the knowledge that the nonzero elements are perfectly uncorrelated and that we have perfect estimates for the data correlation matrix, (the latter is true in the limit as L \u2192 \u221e). In this paper, we formulate the problem of support recovery in the non ideal setting, i.e., when the correlation matrix is estimated with finite L. The resulting support recovery problem which explicitly utilizes the correlation knowledge, can be formulated as a LASSO. The performance of such \u201ccorrelation aware\u201d LASSO is analyzed by providing lower bounds on the probability of successful recovery as a function of the number L of measurement vectors. Numerical results are also provided to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed correlation aware framework over conventional MMV techniques under identical conditions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Rochester", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "Tsinghua University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Anhui University", "University of Texas at Arlington", "Anhui University", "Anhui University", "Samsung", "University of Rochester", "Philips", "Google", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Open University", "\u00c9cole des ponts ParisTech", "NEC Laboratorie ...
