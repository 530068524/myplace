Libraries providing such features, while indispensable, are difficult to write, and often cannot be tailored or composed to meet the needs of specific users. We introduce  reagents , a set of combinators for concisely expressing concurrency algorithms. Reagents scale as well as their hand-coded counterparts, while providing the composability existing libraries lack.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Aaron Turon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turon:Aaron"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
