Driven by a desire to expose our students to relevant and modern materials, we conducted two surveys, one of AI instructors and one of AI practitioners. The surveys were aimed at gathering information about the current state of the art of introducing AI as well as gathering input from practitioners in the field on techniques used in practice. In this paper, we present and briefly discuss the responses to those two surveys.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology", "Canisius College", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of New Mexico", "Michigan Techno ... ical Institute"], "authors": ["Michael Wollowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wollowski:Michael", "Robert Selkowitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Selkowitz:Robert", "Laura E.
