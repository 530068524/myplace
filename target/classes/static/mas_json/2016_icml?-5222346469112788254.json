Specifically we develop an algorithm based upon fast epigraph projections, projections onto the epigraph of a convex function, an approach closely linked to proximal operator methods. We show that by using these operators, we can solve any disciplined convex program without transforming the problem to a standard cone form, as is done by current DCP libraries. We then develop a large library of efficient epigraph projection operators, mirroring and extending work on fast proximal algorithms, for many common convex functions. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the algorithm, and show it often achieves order of magnitude speedups over existing general-purpose optimization solvers.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Stanford University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Po-Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Po=Wei", "Matt Wytock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wytock:Matt", "J.
