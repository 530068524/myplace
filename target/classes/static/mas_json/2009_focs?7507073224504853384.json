Recently, however, it was shown to have exponential worst-case running time. In order to close the gap between practical performance and theoretical analysis, the k-means method has been studied in the model of smoothed analysis. But even the smoothed analyses so far are unsatisfactory as the bounds are still super-polynomial in the number n of data points. In this paper, we settle the smoothed running time of the k-means method. We show that the smoothed number of iterations is bounded by a polynomial in n and 1/sigma, where sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian perturbations. This means that if an arbitrary input data set is randomly perturbed, then the k-means method will run in expected polynomial time on that input set.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of Twente", "Maastricht University"], "authors": ["David Arthur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arthur:David", "Bodo Manthey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manthey:Bodo", "Heiko R\u00f6glin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=ouml=glin:Heiko"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
