Our metrics comprise variable usage patterns, loop patterns, as well as indicators of control-flow complexity and are extracted by simple data-flow analyses. We demonstrate that our metrics are powerful enough to devise a machine-learning based portfolio solver for software verification. We show that this portfolio solver would be the (hypothetical) overall winner of both the 2014 and 2015 International Competition on Software Verification (SV-COMP). This gives strong empirical evidence for the predictive power of our metrics and demonstrates the viability of portfolio solvers for software verification.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Yulia Demyanova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demyanova:Yulia", "Thomas Pani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pani:Thomas", "Helmut Veith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veith:Helmut", "Florian Zuleger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuleger:Florian"], "pages": 19}
