{"title": "ChargeCache: Reducing DRAM latency by exploiting row access locality.", "fields": ["memory rank", "universal memory", "cas latency", "memory controller", "row"], "abstract": "DRAM latency continues to be a critical bottleneck for system performance. In this work, we develop a low-cost mechanism, called Charge Cache, that enables faster access to recently-accessed rows in DRAM, with no modifications to DRAM chips. Our mechanism is based on the key observation that a recently-accessed row has more charge and thus the following access to the same row can be performed faster. To exploit this observation, we propose to track the addresses of recently-accessed rows in a table in the memory controller. If a later DRAM request hits in that table, the memory controller uses lower timing parameters, leading to reduced DRAM latency. Row addresses are removed from the table after a specified duration to ensure rows that have leaked too much charge are not accessed with lower latency. We evaluate ChargeCache on a wide variety of workloads and show that it provides significant performance and energy benefits for both single-core and multi-core systems.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Hasan Hassan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassan:Hasan", "Gennady Pekhimenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pekhimenko:Gennady", "Nandita Vijaykumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vijaykumar:Nandita", "Vivek Seshadri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seshadri:Vivek", "Donghyuk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Donghyuk", "Oguz Ergin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ergin:Oguz", "Onur Mutlu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mutlu:Onur"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
