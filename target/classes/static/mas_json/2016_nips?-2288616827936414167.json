{"title": "Deep Learning for Predicting Human Strategic Behavior.", "fields": ["deep learning", "scalar", "cognitive model", "experimental economics", "input output"], "abstract": "Predicting the behavior of human participants in strategic settings is an important problem in many domains. Most existing work either assumes that participants are perfectly rational, or attempts to directly model each participant's cognitive processes based on insights from cognitive psychology and experimental economics. In this work, we present an alternative, a deep learning approach that automatically performs cognitive modeling without relying on such expert knowledge. We introduce a novel architecture that allows a single network to generalize across different input and output dimensions by using matrix units rather than scalar units, and show that its performance significantly outperforms that of the previous state of the art, which relies on expert-constructed features.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Jason S.
