When users do not share a common metaphorical model for using these technologies, interpersonal communication breakdowns can occur. Through a set of three 8-week-long field deployments and one ongoing observation in-house, we conducted contextual inquiries around the uses of a relatively new communication technology, a mobile remote presence (MRP) system. We observed many nonhuman-like metaphors (e.g., orienting toward the system as a robot, an object) and human-like metaphors (e.g., a person, or a person with disabilities). These metaphors influence people's expectations about social norms in using the systems. We found that there is a serious risk of creating interpersonal conflict when the metaphors are mismatched between people (e.g., locals use nonhuman-like metaphors when remote pilots use human-like metaphors). We explore the implications for understanding remote pilots' rights and responsibilities and present design guidelines for MRP systems that support geographically distributed groups.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Willow Garage", "Autodesk"], "authors": ["Leila Takayama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takayama:Leila", "Janet Go.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Go:Janet"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
