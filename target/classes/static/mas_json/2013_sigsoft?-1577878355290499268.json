{"title": "PHRT: a model and programmable tool for hardware reengineering automation.", "fields": ["hardware description language", "business process reengineering", "redundancy", "electronic design automation", "scratch"], "abstract": "Hardware reengineering is a highly resource-consuming process of development cycle, so it is important to automate reengineering in order to reduce costs and provide reusable solutions. There are many specialized electronic design automation (EDA) tools for specific cases, but only few programmable tools supporting implementation of user-specific reengineering operations.     This paper presents PhD research, which aims development of such Programmable Hardware Reengineering Tool (PHRT), which can be useful for small hardware-design companies and research groups, who have specific recurrent tasks and cannot afford development of automation tools \u201cfrom scratch\u201d.     We propose HDL-independent \u201chybrid\u201d device representation model for automated analysis and transformation, which combines low-level structural descriptions (netlists) with features from high-level hardware description languages (HDLs). Such model supports parallel analysis and transformation of multiple description layers at once. In our research we present PHRT prototype, which is an extendable core, which provides basic functionality for import/export, analysis, editing and transformation of hybrid models. Its functionality can be extended by extensions and script programs.     At the current state, PHRT prototype is being successfully used by several Russian hardware-design companies. Test results have proven applicability of PHRT as a good framework for user-specific reengineering cases like testing instrumentation and reliability assurance (memory replacement, structural redundancy insertion, etc.).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Saint Petersbur ... versity, Russia"], "authors": ["Oleg Nenashev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nenashev:Oleg"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
