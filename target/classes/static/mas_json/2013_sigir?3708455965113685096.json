In our content-based approach, we collected initial recommendations using the location context as search query in Google Places. We first ranked the recommendations based on their textual similarity to the user profiles. In order to improve the ranking of popular sights, we combined the initial ranking with rankings based on Google Search, popularity and categories. Finally, we performed filtering based on the temporal context. Overall, our system performed well above average and median, and outperformed the baseline - Google Places only -- run.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "authors": ["Maya Sappelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sappelli:Maya", "Suzan Verberne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verberne:Suzan", "Wessel Kraaij.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraaij:Wessel"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
