However, examination of Wikipedia reveals that it contains a complex policy and rule structure that supports the organization. Bureaucratic organizations adopt workarounds to adjust rules more accurately to the context of use. Rather than resorting to these potentially dangerous exceptions, Wikipedia has created officially sanctioned rule breaking. The use and impact of the official rule breaking policy within Wikipedia is examined to test its impact on the outcomes of requests to delete articles in from the encyclopedia. The results demonstrate that officially sanctioned rule breaking and the Ignore all rules (IAR) policy are meaningful influences on deliberation outcomes, and rather than wreaking havoc, the IAR policy in Wikipedia has been adopted as a positive, functional governance mechanism.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Edinboro University of Pennsylvania", "Duquesne University", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Elisabeth Joyce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joyce:Elisabeth", "Jacqueline Pike.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pike:Jacqueline", "Brian S.
