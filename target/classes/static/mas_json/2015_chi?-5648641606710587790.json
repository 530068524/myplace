{"title": "Optimizing Touchscreen Keyboards for Gesture Typing.", "fields": ["touchscreen", "typing", "ambiguity", "gesture", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "Despite its growing popularity, gesture typing suffers from a major problem not present in touch typing: gesture ambiguity on the Qwerty keyboard. By applying rigorous mathematical optimization methods, this paper systematically investigates the optimization space related to the accuracy, speed, and Qwerty similarity of a gesture typing keyboard. Our investigation shows that optimizing the layout for gesture clarity (a metric measuring how unique word gestures are on a keyboard) drastically improves the accuracy of gesture typing. Moreover, if we also accommodate gesture speed, or both gesture speed and Qwerty similarity, we can still reduce error rates by 52% and 37% over Qwerty, respectively. In addition to investigating the optimization space, this work contributes a set of optimized layouts such as GK-D and GK-T that can immediately benefit mobile device users.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Brian A.
