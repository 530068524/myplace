The main idea is to decompose the collection into a set of overlapping sets of photos that can be processed in parallel, and to merge the resulting reconstructions. This overlapping clustering problem is formulated as a constrained optimization and solved iteratively. The merging algorithm, designed to be parallel and out-of-core, incorporates robust filtering steps to eliminate low-quality reconstructions and enforce global visibility constraints. The approach has been tested on several large datasets downloaded from Flickr.com, including one with over ten thousand images, yielding a 3D reconstruction with nearly thirty million points.", "citation": "Citations (674)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Google", "University of Washington", "Google", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yasutaka Furukawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furukawa:Yasutaka", "Brian Curless.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curless:Brian", "Steven M.
