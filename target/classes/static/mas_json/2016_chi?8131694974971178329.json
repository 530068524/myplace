{"title": "Destructive Games: Creating Value by Destroying Valuable Physical Objects.", "fields": ["laser cutting", "multimedia", "interactive art", "fabrication", "simulation"], "abstract": "While personal fabrication tools, such as laser cutters and milling machines, are intended for construction, we are exploring their use for destruction. We present a series of games that result in valuable physical objects being destroyed objects owned by the players. Interestingly, we found that we can design these games to be desirable to play, despite the loss of the object, by instead producing social value. As part of a user study, twelve students played a destructive game in which a laser cutter cut up their own money bills. Surprisingly, 8 out of 12 participants would play again. They shared their post-game stories with us.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David Eickhoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eickhoff:David", "Stefanie M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:Stefanie", "Patrick Baudisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baudisch:Patrick"], "pages": 5}
