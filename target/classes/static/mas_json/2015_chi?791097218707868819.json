{"title": "The Roly-Poly Mouse: Designing a Rolling Input Device Unifying 2D and 3D Interaction.", "fields": ["computer hardware", "user interface", "amplitude", "input device", "3d interaction"], "abstract": "We present the design and evaluation of the Roly-Poly Mouse (RPM), a rolling input device that combines the advantages of the mouse (position displacement) and of 3D devices (roll and rotation) to unify 2D and 3D interaction. Our first study explores RPM gesture amplitude and stability for different upper shapes (Hemispherical, Convex) and hand postures. 8 roll directions can be performed precisely and their amplitude is larger on Hemispherical RPM. As minor rolls affect translation, we propose a roll correction algorithm to support stable 2D pointing with RPM. We propose the use of compound gestures for 3D pointing and docking, and evaluate them against a commercial 3D device, the SpaceMouse. Our studies reveal that RPM performs 31% faster than the SpaceMouse for 3D pointing and equivalently for 3D rotation. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept integrated RPM prototype along with discussion on the various technical challenges to overcome to build a final integrated version of RPM.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse", "LRA, Berger-Lev ... oulouse, France", "LRA, Berger-Lev ... oulouse, France"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gary Perelman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perelman:Gary", "Marcos Serrano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serrano:Marcos", "Mathieu Raynal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raynal:Mathieu", "Celia Picard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Picard:Celia", "Mustapha Derras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Derras:Mustapha", "Emmanuel Dubois.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dubois_0001:Emmanuel"], "pages": 10}
