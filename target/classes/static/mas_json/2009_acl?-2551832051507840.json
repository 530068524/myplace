However, when dealing with a new task, it is still difficult to quickly select a suitable one from various FS methods provided by many previous studies. In this paper, we propose a theoretic framework of FS methods based on two basic measurements: frequency measurement and ratio measurement. Then six popular FS methods are in detail discussed under this framework. Moreover, with the guidance of our theoretical analysis, we propose a novel method called weighed frequency and odds (WFO) that combines the two measurements with trained weights. The experimental results on data sets from both topic-based and sentiment classification tasks show that this new method is robust across different tasks and numbers of selected features.", "citation": "Citations (140)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shoushan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shoushan", "Rui Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Rui", "Chengqing Zong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zong:Chengqing", "Chu-Ren Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chu=Ren"], "pages": 9}
