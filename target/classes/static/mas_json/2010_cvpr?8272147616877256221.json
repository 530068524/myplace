We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. This includes an innovative cue measuring the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure [17], and the combined measure to perform better than any cue alone. Finally, we show how to sample windows from an image according to their objectness distribution and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. In experiments on PASCAL VOC 07 we show this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by class-specific object detectors.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Bogdan Alexe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alexe:Bogdan", "Thomas Deselaers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deselaers:Thomas", "Vittorio Ferrari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferrari:Vittorio"], "pages": 8}
