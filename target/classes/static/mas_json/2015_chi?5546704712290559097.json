{"title": "FugaciousFilm: Exploring Attentive Interaction with Ephemeral Material.", "fields": ["ephemeral key", "peripheral", "soap film", "ranging", "iterative and incremental development"], "abstract": "This paper introduces FugaciousFilm, a soap film based touch display, as a platform for Attentive Interaction that encourages the user to be highly focused throughout the use of the interface. Previous work on ephemeral user interfaces has primarily focused on the development of ambient and peripheral displays. In contrast, FugaciousFilm is an ephemeral display that aims to promote highly attentive interaction. We present the iterative process of developing this interface, spanning technical explorations, prototyping and a user study. We report lessons learnt when designing the interface; ranging from the soap film mixture to the impact of frames and apertures. We then describe developing the touch, push, pull and pop interactions. Our user study shows how FugaciousFilm led to focused and attentive interactions during a tournament of enhanced Tic-Tac-Toe. We then finish by discussing how the principles of vulnerability and delicacy can motivate the design of attentive ephemeral interfaces.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Hyosun Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Hyosun", "Shashank Jaiswal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaiswal:Shashank", "Steve Benford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benford:Steve", "Sue Ann Seah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seah:Sue_Ann", "Peter D.
