This work motivates and grounds the use of geo-exploration data to predict the information exploration behavior of users and to support their search. Based on a two-week field study involving 35 participants, we have identified multiple geo-exploration features that have significant associations with a user's information exploration behavior. We also found that the same geo-exploration features could be combined to build predictive models for various facets of an individual's information exploration behavior, and these models performed significantly better than comparable personality-based models.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["The State Unive ... y of New Jersey", "The State Unive ... y of New Jersey", "The State Unive ... y of New Jersey"], "authors": ["Dongho Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Dongho", "Chirag Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Chirag", "Vivek K.
