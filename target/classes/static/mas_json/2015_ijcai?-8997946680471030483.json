{"title": "The Logic of Qualitative Probability.", "fields": ["operator", "probability theory", "binary operation", "axiom", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "In this paper we present a theory of qualitative probability. Work in the area goes back at least to de Finetti. The usual approach is to specify a binary operator \u2264 with \u03d5 \u2264 \u03c8 having the intended interpretation that \u03d5 is not more probable than \u03c8. We generalise these approaches by extending the domain of the operator \u2264 from the set of events to the set of finite sequences of events. If \u03a6 and \u03c8 are finite sequences of events, \u03a6 \u2264 \u03c8 has the intended interpretation that the summed probabilities of the elements of \u03a6 is not greater than the sum of those of \u03c8. We provide a sound and complete axiomatisation for this operator over finite outcome sets, and show that this theory is sufficiently powerful to capture the results of axiomatic probability theory. We argue that our approach is simpler and more perspicuous than previous accounts. As well, we prove that our approach generalises the two major accounts for finite outcome sets.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Vancouver, B.C., Canada"], "authors": ["James P.
