We design and evaluate two novel graph attacks against a state-of-the-art network-level, graph-based detection system. Our work highlights areas in adversarial machine learning that have not yet been addressed, specifically: graph-based clustering techniques, and a global feature space where realistic attackers without perfect knowledge must be accounted for (by the defenders) in order to be practical. Even though less informed attackers can evade graph clustering with low cost, we show that some practical defenses are possible.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of Georgia"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Yizheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yizheng", "Yacin Nadji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nadji:Yacin", "Athanasios Kountouras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kountouras:Athanasios", "Fabian Monrose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monrose:Fabian", "Roberto Perdisci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perdisci:Roberto", "Manos Antonakakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antonakakis:Manos", "Nikolaos Vasiloglou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasiloglou:Nikolaos"], "pages": 18}
