{"title": "Disentangling by Factorising.", "fields": ["factorial", "pattern recognition", "artificial intelligence", "unsupervised learning", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We define and address the problem of unsupervised learning of disentangled representations on data generated from independent factors of variation. We propose FactorVAE, a method that disentangles by encouraging the distribution of representations to be factorial and hence independent across the dimensions. We show that it improves upon $\\beta$-VAE by providing a better trade-off between disentanglement and reconstruction quality. Moreover, we highlight the problems of a commonly used disentanglement metric and introduce a new metric that does not suffer from them.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "DeepMind"], "authors": ["Hyunjik Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyunjik", "Andriy Mnih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mnih:Andriy"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
