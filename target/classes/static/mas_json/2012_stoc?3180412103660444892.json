For a given n-vertex planar graph G with edge weights drawn from [1,M] and parameter e>0, our forbidden-set labeling scheme uses labels of length \u03bb = O(e -1  log 2 n log(nM) \u2022 maxlogn). Given the labels of two vertices s and t and of a set F of faulty vertices/edges, our scheme approximates the distance between s and t in G \\ F with stretch (1+e), in O(|F| 2  \u03bb) time.   We then present a general method to transform (1+e) forbidden-set labeling schemas into a fully dynamic (1+e) distance oracle. Our fully dynamic (1+e) distance oracle is of size O(n log{n} \u2022 maxlogn) and has ~O(n 1/2 ) query and update time, both the query and the update time are worst case. This improves on the best previously known (1+e) dynamic distance oracle for planar graphs, which has worst case query time ~O(n 2/3 ) and amortized update time of ~O(n 2/3 ).   Our (1+e) forbidden-set labeling scheme can also be extended into a forbidden-set labeled routing scheme with stretch (1+e).", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "University of Bordeaux"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ittai Abraham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abraham:Ittai", "Shiri Chechik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechik:Shiri", "Cyril Gavoille.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavoille:Cyril"], "pages": 20}
