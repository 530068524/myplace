We attach a point light source to a hand-held camera to add a photometric constraint to the multi-view stereo problem. Using the photometric constraint, we simultaneously solve for shape, surface normal, and reflectance. Unlike prior approaches, we formulate the problem using realistic assumptions of a near light source, non-Lambertian surfaces, perspective camera model, and the presence of ambient lighting. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using simulated and real-world scenes.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Tomoaki Higo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Higo:Tomoaki", "Yasuyuki Matsushita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsushita:Yasuyuki", "Neel Joshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joshi:Neel", "Katsushi Ikeuchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikeuchi:Katsushi"], "pages": 8}
