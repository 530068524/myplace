Courcelle's Theorem builds on Bodlaender's Theorem and states that for every monadic second-order formula \u03c6 and for every k there is a linear-time algorithm that decides whether a given logical structure A of tree width at most k satisfies \u03c6. We prove that both theorems still hold when \"linear time\" is replaced by \"logarithmic space.\" The transfer of the powerful theoretical framework of monadic second-order logic and bounded tree width to logarithmic space allows us to settle a number of both old and recent open problems in the log space world.", "citation": "Citations (112)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Inst. fur Theor ... u\u0308beck, Germany", "Inst. fur Theor ... u\u0308beck, Germany", "Inst. fur Theor ... u\u0308beck, Germany"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Michael Elberfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elberfeld:Michael", "Andreas Jakoby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jakoby:Andreas", "Till Tantau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tantau:Till"], "pages": 10}
