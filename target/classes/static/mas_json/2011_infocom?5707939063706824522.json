This is a challenging task when considering such heterogenous operation conditions and when performed without any external assistance. We present linear programming (LP) optimization and two strategies, named OPT and SWOPT, allowing nodes performing fast, asynchronous, and passive discovery. Our optimization is slotted based and determines a listening schedule describing when to listen, for how long, and on which channel. We compare our strategies with the passive discovery of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The results confirm that our optimization improves the performance in terms of first, average, and last discovery time.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Niels Karowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karowski:Niels", "Aline Carneiro Viana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viana:Aline_Carneiro", "Adam Wolisz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolisz:Adam"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
