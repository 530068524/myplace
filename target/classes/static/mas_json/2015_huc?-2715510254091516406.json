In this paper we report the results of an 18-month field trial investigating the desirability and feasibility of powering electric vehicles (EVs) with domestic solar electricity. Based on extensive collection of data from 7 households including over 75,000 miles of daily EV use, home electricity consumption and generation, and in-depth interviews with householders we develop a detailed understanding of what drives EV decisions in households, quantify to what extent our participating households currently power their EVs with solar electricity, and investigate how feasible the vision of \"self-sustaining electric mobility\" is. We use this understanding to draw implications for future research into supporting emerging practices of EV drivers.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Open University", "Open University", "Open University", "Open University", "Open University"], "authors": ["Jacky Bourgeois.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bourgeois:Jacky", "Stefan Foell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foell:Stefan", "Gerd Kortuem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kortuem:Gerd", "Blaine A.
