{"title": "A* Lasso for Learning a Sparse Bayesian Network Structure for Continuous Variables.", "fields": ["heuristic", "bayesian network", "variable order bayesian network", "directed acyclic graph", "lasso"], "abstract": "We address the problem of learning a sparse Bayesian network structure for continuous variables in a high-dimensional space. The constraint that the estimated Bayesian network structure must be a directed acyclic graph (DAG) makes the problem challenging because of the huge search space of network structures. Most previous methods were based on a two-stage approach that prunes the search space in the first stage and then searches for a network structure satisfying the DAG constraint in the second stage. Although this approach is effective in a low-dimensional setting, it is difficult to ensure that the correct network structure is not pruned in the first stage in a high-dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose a single-stage method, called A* lasso, that recovers the optimal sparse Bayesian network structure by solving a single optimization problem with A* search algorithm that uses lasso in its scoring system. Our approach substantially improves the computational efficiency of the well-known exact methods based on dynamic programming. We also present a heuristic scheme that further improves the efficiency of A* lasso without significantly compromising the quality of solutions. We demonstrate our approach on data simulated from benchmark Bayesian networks and real data.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Jing Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Jing", "Seyoung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seyoung"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
