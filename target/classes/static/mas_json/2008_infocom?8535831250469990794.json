Since energy is a scarce resource, many energy-aware routing algorithms have been proposed to improve network performance. However, previous algorithms have been designed for a subset of these three main elements, which could limit their applicability. Thus, our contribution is here to develop a unified routing algorithm called the Energy-efficient Unified Routing (EURo) algorithm that accommodates any combination of these above key elements. We show via simulations that EURo outperforms the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Samsung", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Sungoh Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Sungoh", "Ness B.
