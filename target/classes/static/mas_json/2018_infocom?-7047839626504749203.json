To reduce cost and increase flexibility, wireless backhauling is needed to connect the mmBSs. The characteristics of mmWave communication, and specifically its high directionality, imply new requirements for efficient routing and scheduling paradigms. We propose an efficient scheduling method, so-called schedule-oriented optimization, based on matching theory that optimizes QoS metrics jointly with routing. It is capable of solving any scheduling problem that can be formulated as a linear program whose variables are link times and QoS metrics. As an example of the schedule-oriented optimization, we show the optimal solution of the maximum throughput fair scheduling (MTFS). Practically, the optimal scheduling can be obtained even for networks with over 200 mmBSs. To further increase the runtime performance, we propose an efficient edge coloring based approximation algorithm with provable performance bound. It achieves over 80% of the optimal max-min throughput and runs 5 to 100 times faster than the optimal algorithm in practice. Finally, we extend the optimal and approximation algorithms for the cases of multi-RF-chain mmBSs and integrated backhaul and access networks.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Simula Research Laboratory", "IMDEA", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Dingwen Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Dingwen", "Hsuan-Yin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Hsuan=Yin", "J\u00f6rg Widmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Widmer:J=ouml=rg", "Matthias Hollick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hollick:Matthias"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
