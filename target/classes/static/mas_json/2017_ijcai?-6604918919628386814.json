{"title": "MRLR: Multi-level Representation Learning for Personalized Ranking in Recommendation.", "fields": ["data mining", "ranking", "machine learning", "feature learning", "bayesian probability"], "abstract": "Representation learning (RL) has recently proven to be effective in capturing local item relationships by modeling item co-occurrence in individual user's interaction record. However, the value of RL for recommendation has not reached the full potential due to two major drawbacks: 1) recommendation is modeled as a rating prediction problem but should essentially be a personalized ranking one; 2) multi-level organizations of items are neglected for fine-grained item relationships. We design a unified Bayesian framework MRLR to learn user and item embeddings from a multi-level item organization, thus benefiting from RL as well as achieving the goal of personalized ranking. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows that MRLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Delft University of Technology", "Nanyang Technological University", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Zhu Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Zhu", "Jie Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0028:Jie", "Jie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Jie", "Alessandro Bozzon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bozzon:Alessandro", "Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yu", "Chi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Chi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
