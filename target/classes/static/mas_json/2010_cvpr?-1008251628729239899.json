{"title": "3D Scene priors for road detection.", "fields": ["prior probability", "contextual image classification", "object detection", "pedestrian crossing", "homogeneity"], "abstract": "Vision\u2013based road detection is important in different areas of computer vision such as autonomous driving, car collision warning and pedestrian crossing detection. However, current vision\u2013based road detection methods are usually based on low\u2013level features and they assume structured roads, road homogeneity, and uniform lighting conditions. Therefore, in this paper, contextual 3D information is used in addition to low\u2013level cues. Low\u2013level photometric invariant cues are derived from the appearance of roads. Contextual cues used include horizon lines, vanishing points, 3D scene layout and 3D road stages. Moreover, temporal road cues are included. All these cues are sensitive to different imaging conditions and hence are considered as weak cues. Therefore, they are combined to improve the overall performance of the algorithm. To this end, the low-level, contextual and temporal cues are combined in a Bayesian framework to classify road sequences. Large scale experiments on road sequences show that the road detection method is robust to varying imaging conditions, road types, and scenarios (tunnels, urban and highway). Further, using the combined cues outperforms all other individual cues. Finally, the proposed method provides highest road detection accuracy when compared to state\u2013of\u2013the\u2013art methods.", "citation": "Citations (101)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "Computer Vision ... ma de Barcelona", "Computer Vision ... ma de Barcelona"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Manuel \u00c1lvarez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Aacute=lvarez:Jos=eacute=_Manuel", "Theo Gevers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gevers:Theo", "Antonio M.
