{"title": "Nominal system T.", "fields": ["godel", "expression", "modulo", "mutual recursion", "recursion"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a new recursion principle for inductive data modulo \u03b1-equivalence of bound names. It makes use of Odersky-style local names when recursing over bound names. It is formulated in an extension of Godel's System T with names that can be tested for equality, explicitly swapped in expressions and restricted to a lexical scope. The new recursion principle is motivated by the nominal sets notion of \"\u03b1-structural recursion\", whose use of names and associated freshness side-conditions in recursive definitions formalizes common practice with binders. The new  Nominal System T   presented here provides a calculus of total functions that is shown to adequately represent \u03b1-structural recursion while avoiding the need to verify freshness side-conditions in definitions and computations. Adequacy is proved via a normalization-by-evaluation argument that makes use of a new semantics of local names in Gabbay-Pitts nominal sets.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Andrew M.
