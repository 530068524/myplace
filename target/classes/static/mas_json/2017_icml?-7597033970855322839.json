{"title": "Maximum Selection and Ranking under Noisy Comparisons.", "fields": ["binary search algorithm", "merge sort", "tournament", "transitive relation", "binary logarithm"], "abstract": "We consider $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-PAC maximum-selection and ranking for general probabilistic models whose comparisons probabilities satisfy strong stochastic transitivity and stochastic triangle inequality. Modifying the popular knockout tournament, we propose a maximum-selection algorithm that uses $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{n}{\\epsilon^2}\\log \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right)$ comparisons, a number tight up to a constant factor. We then derive a general framework that improves the performance of many ranking algorithms, and combine it with merge sort and binary search to obtain a ranking algorithm that uses $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{n\\log n (\\log \\log n)^3}{\\epsilon^2}\\right)$ comparisons for any $\\delta\\ge\\frac1n$, a number optimal up to a $(\\log \\log n)^3$ factor.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Moein Falahatgar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Falahatgar:Moein", "Alon Orlitsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orlitsky:Alon", "Venkatadheeraj Pichapati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pichapati:Venkatadheeraj", "Ananda Theertha Suresh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suresh:Ananda_Theertha"], "pages": 9}
