Bit-based representations have been used effectively in Arc Consistency algorithms. We propose STRbit, a GAC algorithm, based on simple tabular reduction (STR) using an efficient bit vector support data structure. STRbit is extended to deal with compression of the underlying constraint with c-tuples. Experimental evaluation show our algorithms are faster than many algorithms (STR2, STR2-C, STR3, STR3-C and MDDc) across a variety of benchmarks except for problems with small tables where complex data structures do not payoff.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Jilin University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Jilin University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Ruiwei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ruiwei", "Wei Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Wei", "Roland H.
