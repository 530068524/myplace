Our goal is to move towards making accessible the manipulation of everyday objects to individuals with motor impairments. Using our system, we performed several studies using control style variants for both the 2D and 3D arms. Results show that it is indeed possible for a user to learn to effectively manipulate real-world objects with a robotic arm using only non-verbal voice as a control mechanism. Our results provide strong evidence that the further development of non-verbal voice controlled robotics and prosthetic limbs will be successful.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Brandi House.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/House:Brandi", "Jonathan Malkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malkin:Jonathan", "Jeff A.
