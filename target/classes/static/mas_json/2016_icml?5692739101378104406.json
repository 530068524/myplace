Prior work on activity recognition from multivariate time series data has mainly applied supervised learning techniques which require a high degree of annotation effort to produce training data with the start and end times of each activity. In order to reduce the annotation effort, we present a weakly supervised approach based on multi-instance learning. We introduce a generative graphical model for multi-instance learning on time series data based on an auto-regressive hidden Markov model. Our model has a number of advantages, including the ability to produce both bag and instance-level predictions as well as an efficient exact inference algorithm based on dynamic programming.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Xinze Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Xinze", "Raviv Raich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raich:Raviv", "Weng-Keen Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Weng=Keen"], "pages": 10}
