The performance of existing methods, however, deteriorates significantly when applied to ill-conditioned or large-scale matrices. In this paper, we therefore propose an efficient method, called Riemannian Pursuit (RP), that aims to address these two problems simultaneously. Our method consists of a sequence of fixed-rank optimization problems. Each subproblem, solved by a nonlinear Riemannian conjugate gradient method, aims to correct the solution in the most important subspace of increasing size. Theoretically, RP converges linearly under mild conditions and experimental results show that it substantially outperforms existing methods when applied to large-scale and ill-conditioned matrices.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of California, San Diego", "Princeton University", "Institute for I ... 8632, Singapore"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Mingkui Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Mingkui", "Ivor W.
