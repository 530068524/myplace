{"title": "Fine-Grained Recognition of Thousands of Object Categories with Single-Example Training.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "training set", "studio", "logos bible software", "statistical model"], "abstract": "We approach the problem of fast detection and recognition of a large number (thousands) of object categories while training on a very limited amount of examples, usually one per category. Examples of this task include: (i) detection of retail products, where we have only one studio image of each product available for training, (ii) detection of brand logos, and (iii) detection of 3D objects and their respective poses within a static 2D image, where only a sparse subset of (partial) object views is available for training, with a single example for each view. Building a detector based on so few examples presents a significant challenge for the current top-performing (deep) learning based techniques, which require large amounts of data to train. Our approach for this task is based on a non-parametric probabilistic model for initial detection, CNN-based refinement and temporal integration where applicable. We successfully demonstrate its usefulness in a variety of experiments on both existing and our own benchmarks achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Leonid Karlinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karlinsky:Leonid", "Joseph Shtok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shtok:Joseph", "Yochay Tzur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tzur:Yochay", "Asaf Tzadok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tzadok:Asaf"], "pages": 10}
