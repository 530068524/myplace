However, most previous researchers only address the challenge in homogeneous environments. Considering the increasing popularity of heterogeneous systems, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm for power management of heterogeneous soft real-time clusters. It is built on simple but effective mathematical models. When deployed to a new platform, the software incurs low configuration cost because no extensive performance measurements and profiling are required. To strive for efficiency, a threshold-based approach is adopted. In this paper, we systematically study this approach and its design decisions.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Leping Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Leping", "Ying Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0002:Ying"], "pages": 10}
