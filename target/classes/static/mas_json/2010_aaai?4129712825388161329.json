{"title": "Exploiting Monotonicity in Interval Constraint Propagation.", "fields": ["local consistency", "constraint graph", "constraint logic programming", "binary constraint", "hybrid algorithm"], "abstract": "We propose in this paper a new interval constraint propagation algorithm, called MOnotonic Hull Consistency (Mohc), that exploits monotonicity of functions. The propagation is standard, but the Mohc-Revise procedure, used to filter/contract the variable domains w.r.t. an individual constraint, uses monotonic versions of the classical HC4-Revise and BoxNarrow procedures.\n\nMohc-Revise appears to be the first adaptive revise procedure ever proposed in (interval) constraint programming. Also, when a function is monotonic w.r.t. every variable, Mohc-Revise is proven to compute the optimal/sharpest box enclosing all the solutions of the corresponding constraint (hull consistency). Very promising experimental results suggest that Mohc has the potential to become an alternative to the state-of-the-art HC4 and Box algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris"], "authors": ["Ignacio Araya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Araya:Ignacio", "Gilles Trombettoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trombettoni:Gilles", "Bertrand Neveu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neveu:Bertrand"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
