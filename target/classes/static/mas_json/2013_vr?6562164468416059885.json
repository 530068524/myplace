{"title": "Visual exploration of the infinite canvas.", "fields": ["immersion", "visualization", "user interface", "pixel", "data visualization"], "abstract": "We introduce the concept of the infinite canvas as a metaphor for the immersive visual exploration of very large image datasets using a natural walking interface. The interface allows the user to move along the display surface and to be continuously exposed to new data, essentially exploring the horizontal axis of an arbitrarily long canvas. Our system provides a spiral navigation interface that shows a compressed immersive overview of the data and facilitates the rapid and fluid transition to distant points within the infinite canvas. We demonstrate the implementation of the infinite canvas in the world's first 1.5 billion pixel tiled immersive display.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Kaloian Petkov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petkov:Kaloian", "Charilaos Papadopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadopoulos:Charilaos", "Arie E.
