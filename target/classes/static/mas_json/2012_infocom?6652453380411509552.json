{"title": "Data centers power reduction: A two time scale approach for delay tolerant workloads.", "fields": ["data center", "stochastic optimization", "distributed database", "cost reduction", "stochastic programming"], "abstract": "In this work we focus on a stochastic optimization based approach to make distributed routing and server management decisions in the context of large-scale, geographically distributed data centers, which offers significant potential for exploring power cost reductions. Our approach considers such decisions at different time scales and offers provable power cost and delay characteristics. The utility of our approach and its robustness are also illustrated through simulation-based experiments under delay tolerant workloads.", "citation": "Citations (187)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Yuan Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Yuan", "Longbo Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Longbo", "Abhishek B.
