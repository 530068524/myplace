This paper explores the capability of these networks to support multicast traffic, where each source node desires to send packets to k distinct destinations and all nodes move according to the generalized hybrid random walk mobility model. We show how the network capacity and related delay/delay jitter for supporting multicast in such ICMNs are scaling with the basic network parameters under three transmission protocols: one-hop relay, two-hop relay without packet redundancy and two-hop relay with packet redundancy.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Tohoku University", "Future University Hakodate", "Tohoku University", "Tohoku University"], "authors": ["Jiajia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jiajia", "Xiaohong Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Xiaohong", "Hiroki Nishiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishiyama:Hiroki", "Nei Kato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kato:Nei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
