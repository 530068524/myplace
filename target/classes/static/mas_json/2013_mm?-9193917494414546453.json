To do so, Orcc embeds two rich eclipse-based editors that provide an easy writing of dataflow applications, a simulator that allows quick validation of the written code, and a multi-target compiler that is able to translate any dataflow program, written in the RVC-CAL language, into an equivalent description in both hardware and software languages. Orcc has already been used to successfully write tens of multimedia applications, such as a video decoder supporting the new High Efficiency Video Coding standard, that clearly demonstrates the ability of the environment to develop complex applications. Moreover, results show scalable performances on multi-core platforms and achieve real-time decoding frame-rate on HD sequences.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["University of Rennes", "Intelligence and National Security Alliance", "Intelligence and National Security Alliance", "Intelligence and National Security Alliance", "Intelligence and National Security Alliance"], "authors": ["Herv\u00e9 Yviquel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yviquel:Herv=eacute=", "Antoine Lorence.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lorence:Antoine", "Khaled Jerbi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jerbi:Khaled", "Gildas Cocherel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cocherel:Gildas", "Alexandre Sanchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanchez:Alexandre", "Micka\u00ebl Raulet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raulet:Micka=euml=l"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
