We show that our proposed framework conceptually unifies multiple previous methods in exploration. We also derive a practical algorithm that achieves efficient exploration on challenging control tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Yunhao Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Yunhao", "Shipra Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal_0001:Shipra"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
