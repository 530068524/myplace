{"title": "iBeam: Intelligent client-side multi-user beamforming in wireless networks.", "fields": ["multi user mimo", "beamforming", "client side", "telecommunications link", "radio resource management"], "abstract": "Frequently, client-side wireless devices have a view of multiple WiFi access points, whether from open residential and commercial networks, corporate networks, or mesh networks. Given the increasing number of radios and antennas in today's wireless devices, residual capacity from these multiple APs could be leveraged if client devices communicate with multiple APs simultaneously. In this paper, we exploit multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) technology to improve throughput and reliability in both directions of a wireless connection. For uplink, we use multi-user beamforming to enable the client devices to send multiple data streams to multiple APs simultaneously. For downlink, we leverage interference nulling technology to allow the client devices to decode parallel packets from multiple APs. This iBeam system requires no changes to existing APs or backhaul networks and is compatible with the IEEE 802.11 standards. We experimentally evaluate iBeam and show significant throughput improvements over both single-AP connections and multi-AP connections in a time division mode. The client's reliability and stability are also significantly improved due to the multi-AP diversity gain.
