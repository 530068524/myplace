Our algorithms operate in two phases. In the first phase, we use a recently introduced SampleSearch scheme to generate biased samples while in the second phase we correct the bias by using either Sampling/lmportance Resampling or the Metropolis-Hastings method. Unlike state-of-the-art algorithms, our algorithms guarantee convergence in the limit. Our empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of our new algorithms over several competing schemes.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Vibhav Gogate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gogate:Vibhav", "Rina Dechter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dechter:Rina"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
