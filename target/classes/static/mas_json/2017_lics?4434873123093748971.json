{"title": "Succinct progress measures for solving parity games.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "bounded function", "discrete mathematics", "coding", "parity"], "abstract": "The recent breakthrough paper by Calude et al. has given the first algorithm for solving parity games in quasi-polynomial time, where previously the best algorithms were mildly subexponential. We devise an alternative quasi-polynomial time algorithm based on progress measures, which allows us to reduce the space required from quasi-polynomial to nearly linear. Our key technical tools are a novel concept of ordered tree coding, and a succinct tree coding result that we prove using bounded adaptive multi-counters, both of which are interesting in their own right.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "University of Warwick"], "authors": ["Marcin Jurdzinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jurdzinski:Marcin", "Ranko Lazic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazic:Ranko"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
