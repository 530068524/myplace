We demonstrate its generic applicability and effectiveness by applying this principle to three typical sensor network technologies, namely, localization ( Spotlight ), sensing ( uSense ) and communication ( mNets ). These technologies have very dissimilar features, representing a wide spectrum of system design requirements. We have invested significant effort to design, implement and evaluate our techniques on TinyOS/Mote testbeds. The results from several running systems indicate that asymmetric function placement is a powerful guiding principle to achieve  efficiency  and  high-performance  simultaneously in wireless sensor networks. At the end, we exam the system features that discourage the use of asymmetric function placement and approaches to address them.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Virginia", "Texas A&M University", "University of Minnesota", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Tian He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Tian", "John A.
