{"title": "You Put What, Where?: Hobbyist Use of Insertable Devices.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "wearable computer", "electronics", "body area network", "emerging technologies"], "abstract": "The human body has emerged as more than a canvas for wearable electronic devices. Devices too go within the body, such as internal medical devices. Within the last decade, individual hobbyists have begun voluntarily inserting non-medical devices in, through and underneath their skin. This paper investigates the current use of insertable devices. Through interviews we report on the types of devices people are inserting into their bodies. We classify the use of insertables and the reasons individuals choose insertables over more traditional wearable or luggable devices. These classifications facilitate understanding of insertables as a legitimate category of device for hardware designers that present new challenges for interaction designers.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kayla J.
