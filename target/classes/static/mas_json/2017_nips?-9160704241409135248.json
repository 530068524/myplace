{"title": "Graph Matching via Multiplicative Update Algorithm.", "fields": ["multiplicative function", "quadratic programming", "matching", "integer", "karush kuhn tucker conditions"], "abstract": "As a fundamental problem in computer vision, graph matching problem can usually be formulated as a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem with doubly stochastic and discrete (integer) constraints. Since it is NP-hard, approximate algorithms are required. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, called Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM), that develops a multiplicative update technique to solve the QP matching problem. MPGM has three main benefits: (1) theoretically, MPGM solves the general QP problem with doubly stochastic constraint naturally whose convergence and KKT optimality are guaranteed. (2) Em- pirically, MPGM generally returns a sparse solution and thus can also incorporate the discrete constraint approximately. (3) It is efficient and simple to implement. Experimental results show the benefits of MPGM algorithm.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Anhui University", "Anhui University", "Anhui University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Bo Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0002:Bo", "Jin Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jin", "Chris Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Chris", "Yihong Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Yihong", "Bin Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Bin"], "pages": 9}
