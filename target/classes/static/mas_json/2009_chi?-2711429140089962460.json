Instead of focusing on such technical possibilities, here we investigate the way people compose long-term mnemonic representations of their lives. We asked 10 families to create a time capsule, a collection of objects used to trigger remembering in the distant future. Our results show that contrary to the lifelogging view, people are less interested in exhaustively digitally recording their past than in reconstructing it from carefully selected cues that are often physical objects. Time capsules were highly expressive and personal, many objects were made explicitly for inclusion, however with little object annotation. We use these findings to propose principles for designing technology that supports the active reconstruction of our future past.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "University of Sheffield"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniela Petrelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrelli:Daniela", "Elise van den Hoven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoven:Elise_van_den", "Steve Whittaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittaker:Steve"], "pages": 10}
