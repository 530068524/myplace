These emerging platforms have started to revolutionize many fields, including healthcare and wellness applications, particularly when integrated with intelligent analytic capabilities. However, a significant challenge that computer architects are facing is how to embed sophisticated analytic capabilities in wearable computers in an energy-efficient way while not compromising system performance. In this paper, we present XPro, a novel cross-end analytic engine architecture for wearable computing systems. The proposed cross-end architecture is able to realize a generic classification design across wearable sensors and a data aggregator with high energy-efficiency. To facilitate the practical use of XPro, we also develop an Automatic XPro Generator that formally generates XPro instances according to specific design constraints. As a proof of concept, we study the design and implementation of XPro with six different health applications. Evaluation results show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, XPro can increase the battery life of the sensor node by 1.6-2.4X while at the same time reducing system delay by 15.6-60.8% for wearable computing systems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "Oregon State University", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Aosen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Aosen", "Lizhong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lizhong", "Wenyao Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Wenyao"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
