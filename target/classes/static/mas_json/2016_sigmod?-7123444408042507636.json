Increasingly, modern data analysis pipelines involve Machine Learning, and the effects of dirty data can be difficult to debug.Dirty data is often sparse, and naive sampling solutions are not suited for high-dimensional models. We propose ActiveClean, a progressive framework for training Machine Learning models with data cleaning. Our framework updates a model iteratively as the analyst cleans small batches of data, and includes numerous optimizations such as importance weighting and dirty data detection. We designed a visual interface to wrap around this framework and demonstrate ActiveClean for a video classification problem and a topic modeling problem.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Simon Fraser University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sanjay Krishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnan:Sanjay", "Michael J.
