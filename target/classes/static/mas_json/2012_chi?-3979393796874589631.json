We evaluated numerous existing mind mapping software applications, performed ethnographic research with a variety of users, and developed a framework of principles to inform the design of future tools for collaborative knowledge management. Our findings suggest an opportunity to advance digital mind mapping beyond the existing state-of-the-art, particularly in the areas of improving workflow, facilitating collaboration, and supporting information storage and retrieval. We conclude with suggestions for how to improve digital mind mapping systems, specifically with regard to real-time collaborative thinking.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Haakon Faste.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faste:Haakon", "Honray Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Honray"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
