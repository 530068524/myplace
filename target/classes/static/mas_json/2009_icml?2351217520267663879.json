We add an adaptive uncertainty handling based on Hoeffding and empirical Bernstein races to the CMA-ES, a variable metric evolution strategy proposed for direct policy search. The uncertainty handling adjusts individually the number of episodes considered for the evaluation of a policy. The performance estimation is kept just accurate enough for a sufficiently good ranking of candidate policies, which is in turn sufficient for the CMA-ES to find better solutions. This increases the learning speed as well as the robustness of the algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (126)", "departments": ["Institut f\u00fcr Ne ... Bochum, Germany", "Institut f\u00fcr Ne ...
