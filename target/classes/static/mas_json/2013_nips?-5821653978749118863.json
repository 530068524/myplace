Unfortunately, these estimators normally create computational difficulties that entail sophisticated algorithms. Our first contribution is to uncover a rich class of structured sparse regularizers whose polar operator can be evaluated efficiently. With such an operator, a simple conditional gradient method can then be developed that, when combined with smoothing and local optimization, significantly reduces training time vs. the state of the art. We also demonstrate a new reduction of polar to proximal maps that enables more efficient latent fused lasso.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "Machine Learnin ... tralia and ANU"], "authors": ["Xinhua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xinhua", "Yaoliang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yaoliang", "Dale Schuurmans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuurmans:Dale"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
