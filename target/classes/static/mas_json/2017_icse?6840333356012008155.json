The combinatorial nature (many waste items and many management options) and multiple objectives of the SWM problem severely constrain the effectiveness of a manual search process using these tools. Recognizing this, researchers have proposed several optimization-based search procedures. These methods, however, enjoy limited use due to the substantial expertise required for their application. This paper presents a new computer-based decision support framework that addresses these limitations. The new framework integrates process models that quantify the life-cycle inventory of a range of pollutants and costs for an extensive municipal solid waste system, an optimization search procedure that identifies strategies that meet cost and environmental objectives and site-specific restrictions, and a user-friendly interface that facilitates utilization of these components by practitioners. After describing the software design, the use and value of the tool in typical waste management scenarios is demonstrated through a hypothetical, but realistic, case study in which several alternative SWM strategies are generated and examined.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Blekinge Institute of Technology", "Blekinge Institute of Technology", "Blekinge Institute of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of British Columbia", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Cisco Systems, Inc.", "National University of Ireland, Galway", "Uppsala University", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki", "Burke Porter Machinery", "Atomic Object LLC", "Atomic Object LLC", "Atomic Object LLC", "VTT Tech.
