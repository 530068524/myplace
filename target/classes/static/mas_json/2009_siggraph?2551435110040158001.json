Traditional video EEG is the gold standard for diagnosis, but is usually outside the scope of most neonatal providers to interpret. The development of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) gives neonatal providers a unique bedside opportunity to trend and interpret real-time neurologic activity to better care for the infants in the NICU. However, the interpretation is only as reliable as the information the monitor provides. It is critical for the nursing staff to correctly place aEEG monitor leads, assess for proper function, and troubleshoot potential concerns. Based on published information plus my own experiences working with aEEG monitors as well as teaching its use to almost 200 staff nurses in two Level III/IV NICUs, I will present a concise, approachable guide covering lead placement, troubleshooting, and basic interpretation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Ionian University", "Ionian University", "Ionian University", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Spain"], "authors": ["Coke Ferreiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreiro:Coke"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
