We present rateless coding schemes for two adversarial models, where the source sends more redundancy over time, until decoding succeeds. The first model assumes there is a secret channel between the source and the destination that the adversaries cannot overhear. The rate of the channel is negligible compared to the main network. In the second model the source and destination share random secrets independent of the input information. The amount of secret information required is negligible compared to the amount of information sent. Both schemes are capacity optimal, distributed, polynomial-time and end-to-end in that other than the source and destination nodes, other intermediate nodes carry out classical random linear network coding.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Wentao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Wentao", "Tracey Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Tracey", "Hongyi Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Hongyi", "Sidharth Jaggi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaggi:Sidharth"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
