{"title": "Fairness Modulo Theory: A New Approach to LTL Software Model Checking.", "fields": ["linear temporal logic", "ranking", "prefix", "liveness", "modulo"], "abstract": "The construction of a proof for unsatisfiability is less costly than the construction of a ranking function. We present a new approach to LTL software model checking (i.e., to statically analyze a program and verify a temporal property from the full class of LTL including general liveness properties) which aims at exploiting this fact. The idea is to select finite prefixes of a path and check these for infeasibility before considering the full infinite path. We have implemented a tool which demonstrates the practical potential of the approach. In particular, the tool can verify several benchmark programs for a liveness property just with finite prefixes (and thus without the construction of a single ranking function).", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Daniel Dietsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dietsch:Daniel", "Matthias Heizmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heizmann:Matthias", "Vincent Langenfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langenfeld:Vincent", "Andreas Podelski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Podelski:Andreas"], "pages": 18}
