These problems are grouped under the umbrella term of Optimization Modulo Theories \u2013 OMT. In this paper we present OptiMathSAT, an OMT tool extending the MathSAT5 SMT solver. OptiMathSAT allows for solving a list of optimization problems on SMT formulas with linear objective functions \u2013on the Boolean, the rational and the integer domains, and on their combination thereof\u2013 including MaxSMT. Multiple objective functions can be combined together and handled either independently, or lexicographically, or in a min-max/max-min fashion.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Roberto Sebastiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebastiani:Roberto", "Patrick Trentin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trentin:Patrick"], "pages": 8}
