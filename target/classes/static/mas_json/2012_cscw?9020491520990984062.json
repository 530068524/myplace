{"title": "CrowdWeaver: visually managing complex crowd work.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "visualization", "human computer interaction", "reuse", "workflow"], "abstract": "Though toolkits exist to create complex crowdsourced workflows, there is limited support for management of those workflows. Managing crowd workers and tasks requires significant iteration and experimentation on task instructions, rewards, and flows. We present CrowdWeaver, a system to visually manage complex crowd work. The system supports the creation and reuse of crowdsourcing and computational tasks into integrated task flows, manages the flow of data between tasks, and allows tracking and notification of task progress, with support for real-time modification. We describe the system and demonstrate its utility through case studies and user feedback.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Aniket Kittur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kittur:Aniket", "Susheel Khamkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khamkar:Susheel", "Paul Andr\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andr=eacute=:Paul", "Robert E.
