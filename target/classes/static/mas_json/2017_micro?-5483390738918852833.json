While nonlinear PDEs are typically solved in high-performance supercomputers, they are increasingly used in graphics and embedded systems, where efficiency is important.   We use a hybrid analog-digital computer architecture to solve nonlinear PDEs that draws on the strengths of each model of computation and avoids their weaknesses. A weakness of digital methods for solving nonlinear PDEs is they may not converge unless a good initial guess is used to seed the solution. A weakness of analog is it cannot produce high accuracy results. In our hybrid method we seed the digital solver with a high-quality guess from the analog side.   With a physically prototyped analog accelerator, we use this hybrid analog-digital method to solve the two-dimensional viscous Burgers' equation ---an important and representative PDE. For large grid sizes and nonlinear problem parameters, the hybrid method reduces the solution time by 5.7\u00d7, and reduces energy consumption by 11.6\u00d7, compared to a baseline solver running on a GPU.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Yipeng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Yipeng", "Ning Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Ning", "Mingoo Seok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seok:Mingoo", "Yannis P.
