{"title": "First International Workshop on Professional Search (ProfS2018).", "fields": ["information needs", "exploratory search", "data mining", "user requirements document", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "Professional search is a problem area in which many facets of information retrieval are addressed, both system-related (e.g. distributed search) and user-related (e.g. complex information needs), and the interface between user and system (e.g. supporting exploratory search tasks). Professional search tasks have specific requirements, different from the requirements of generic web search. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers to work on the requirements and challenges of professional search from different angles. We will have an interactive workshop where researchers not only present their scientific results but also work together on the definition of future challenges and solutions with input from information professionals. The workshop will deliver a roadmap of research directions for the years to come.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Leiden University", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "University of Essex", "Aalborg University", "UXLabs, Guildfo ...
