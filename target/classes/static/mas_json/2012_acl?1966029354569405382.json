First, syntactic and semantic structures capturing essential lexical and syntactic properties of verbs are defined. Then, we design advanced similarity functions between such structures, i.e., semantic tree kernel functions, for exploiting distributional and grammatical information in Support Vector Machines. The extensive empirical analysis on VerbNet class and frame detection shows that our models capture meaningful syntactic/semantic structures, which allows for improving the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Rome Tor Vergata", "University of Trento", "University of Rome Tor Vergata", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Danilo Croce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Croce:Danilo", "Alessandro Moschitti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moschitti:Alessandro", "Roberto Basili.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basili_0001:Roberto", "Martha Palmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palmer:Martha"], "pages": 10}
