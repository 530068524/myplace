{"title": "Temporal Planning with Semantic Attachment of Non-Linear Monotonic Continuous Behaviours.", "fields": ["nonlinear system", "linear programming", "planning domain definition language", "monotonic function", "physical system"], "abstract": "Non-linear continuous change is common in real-world problems, especially those that model physical systems. We present an algorithm which builds upon existent temporal planning techniques based on linear programming to approximate non-linear continuous monotonic functions. These are integrated through a semantic attachment mechanism, allowing external libraries or functions that are difficult to model in native PDDL to be evaluated during the planning process. A new planning system implementing this algorithm was developed and evaluated. Results show that the addition of this algorithm to the planning process can enable it to solve a broader set of planning problems.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["King's College London", "King's College London", "King's College London"], "authors": ["Josef Bajada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bajada:Josef", "Maria Fox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fox:Maria", "Derek Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Derek"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
