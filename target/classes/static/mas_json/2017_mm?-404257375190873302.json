In this paper, we adopt the dimensional valence-arousal (V-A) emotion model to represent the dynamic emotion in music. In our opinion, music and V-A emotion label do not have the one-to-one correspondence in the time domain, while the expression of music emotion at one moment is the accumulation of previous music content for a period of time, so we propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based sequence-to-one mapping for dynamic music emotion prediction. Based on this sequence-to-one music emotion mapping, it is proved that different time scales' preceding content has an influence on the LSTM model's performance, so we further propose the Multi-scale Context based Attention (MCA) for dynamic music emotion prediction. We evaluate our proposed method on the database of  Emotion in Music  task at  MediaEval 2015 , and the results show that our proposed method outperforms most of the models using the same features and achieves a competitive performance with the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Ye Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Ye", "Xinxing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xinxing", "Mingxing Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Mingxing", "Jia Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia_0001:Jia", "Lianhong Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Lianhong"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
