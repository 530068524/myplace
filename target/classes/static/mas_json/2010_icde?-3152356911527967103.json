{"title": "Surrogate ranking for very expensive similarity queries.", "fields": ["result set", "bayesian statistics", "database administrator", "ranking", "nearest neighbor search"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of similarity search in applications where the cost of computing the similarity between two records is very expensive, and the similarity measure is not a metric. In such applications, comparing even a tiny fraction of the database records to a single query record can be orders of magnitude slower than reading the entire database from disk, and indexing is often not possible. We develop a general-purpose, statistical framework for answering top-k queries in such databases, when the database administrator is able to supply an inexpensive surrogate ranking function that substitutes for the actual similarity measure. We develop a robust method that learns the relationship between the surrogate function and the similarity measure. Given a query, we use Bayesian statistics to update the model by taking into account the observed partial results. Using the updated model, we construct bounds on the accuracy of the result set obtained via the surrogate ranking. Our experiments show that our models can produce useful bounds for several real-life applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "Oracle Corporation", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Fei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Fei", "Ravi Jampani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jampani:Ravi", "Mingxi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Mingxi", "Chris Jermaine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jermaine:Chris", "Tamer Kahveci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kahveci:Tamer"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
