{"title": "Dimensionality Reduction with Subspace Structure Preservation.", "fields": ["statistical assumption", "diffusion map", "dimensionality reduction", "subspace topology", "linear subspace"], "abstract": "Modeling data as being sampled from a union of independent subspaces has been widely applied to a number of real world applications. However, dimensionality reduction approaches that theoretically preserve this independence assumption have not been well studied. Our key contribution is to show that 2K projection vectors are sufficient for the independence preservation of any K class data sampled from a union of independent subspaces. It is this non-trivial observation that we use for designing our dimensionality reduction technique. In this paper, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm that theoretically preserves this structure for a given dataset. We support our theoretical analysis with empirical results on both synthetic and real world data achieving state-of-the-art results compared to popular dimensionality reduction techniques.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Devansh Arpit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arpit:Devansh", "Ifeoma Nwogu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nwogu:Ifeoma", "Venu Govindaraju.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Govindaraju:Venu"], "pages": 9}
