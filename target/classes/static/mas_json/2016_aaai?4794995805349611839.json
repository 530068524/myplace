In recent years, however, the simple structural models such as lasso are frequently proved to be insufficient. Accordingly, there has been a lot of work on \"superposition-structured\" models where multiple structural constraints are imposed. To efficiently solve these \"superposition-structured\" statistical models, we develop a framework based on a proximal Newton-type method. Employing the smoothed conic dual approach with the LBFGS updating formula, we propose a scalable and extensible proximal quasi-Newton (SEP-QN) framework. Empirical analysis on various datasets shows that our framework is potentially powerful, and achieves super-linear convergence rate for optimizing some popular \"superposition-structured\" statistical models such as the fused sparse group lasso.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Shenjian Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shenjian", "Cong Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Cong", "Zhihua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhihua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
