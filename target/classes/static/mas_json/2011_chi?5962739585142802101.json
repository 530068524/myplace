Our work draws from the tradition of pre-cinema handheld projectors that use direct physical manipulation to control projected imagery. With our prototype system, users interact and control projected characters by moving and gesturing with the handheld projector itself. This creates a unified interaction style where input and output are tied together within a single device. We introduce a set of interaction principles and present prototype applications that provide clear examples of the  MotionBeam  metaphor in use. Finally we describe observations and insights from a preliminary user study with our system.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Disney Research", "Disney Research"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Karl D.
