{"title": "Optimal Greedy Diversity for Recommendation.", "fields": ["modular form", "use case", "polytope", "baseline", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "The need for diversification manifests in various recommendation use cases. In this work, we propose a novel approach to diversifying a list of recommended items, which maximizes the utility of the items subject to the increase in their diversity. From a technical perspective, the problem can be viewed as maximization of a modular function on the polytope of a submodular function, which can be solved optimally by a greedy method. We evaluate our approach in an offline analysis, which incorporates a number of baselines and metrics, and in two online user studies. In all the experiments, our method outperforms the baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Technicolor", "Adobe Systems", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Azin Ashkan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ashkan:Azin", "Branislav Kveton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kveton:Branislav", "Shlomo Berkovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berkovsky:Shlomo", "Zheng Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Zheng"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
