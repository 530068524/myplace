{"title": "Unsupervised Feature Learning from Time Series.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "coordinate descent", "feature learning", "regularization", "time series"], "abstract": "In this paper we study the problem of learning discriminative features (segments), often referred to as shapelets [Ye and Keogh, 2009] of time series, from unlabeled time series data. Discovering shapelets for time series classification has been widely studied, where many search-based algorithms are proposed to efficiently scan and select segments from a pool of candidates. However, such types of search-based algorithms may incur high time cost when the segment candidate pool is large. Alternatively, a recent work [Grabocka et al., 2014] uses regression learning to directly learn, instead of searching for, shapelets from time series. Motivated by the above observations, we propose a new Unsupervised Shapelet Learning Model (USLM) to efficiently learn shapelets from unlabeled time series data. The corresponding learning function integrates the strengths of pseudo-class label, spectral analysis, shapelets regularization term and regularized least-squares to auto-learn shapelets, pseudo-class labels and classification boundaries simultaneously. A coordinate descent algorithm is used to iteratively solve the learning function. Experiments show that USLM outperforms search-based algorithms on real-world time series data.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "MathWorks", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Qin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0011:Qin", "Jia Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jia", "Hong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Hong", "Yingjie Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Yingjie", "Chengqi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chengqi"], "pages": 7}
