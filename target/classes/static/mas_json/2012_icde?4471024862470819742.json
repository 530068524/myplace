In particular, the feature of explaining missing tuples in a query result, or the so-called \"why-not\" questions, has recently become an active topic. In this paper, we study the problem of answering why-not questions on top-k queries. Our motivation is that we know many users love to use top-k queries when they are making multi-criteria decisions. However, they often feel frustrated when they are asked to quantify their feeling as a set of numeric weightings, and feel even more frustrated after they see the query results do not include their expected answers. In this paper, we use the query-refinement method to approach the problem. Given as inputs the original top-k query and a set of missing tuples, our algorithm returns to the user a refined top-k query that includes the missing tuples. A case study and experimental results show that our approach returns high quality explanations to users efficiently.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Dept. of Comput ... ong Kong, China", "Dept. of Comput ... ong Kong, China"], "authors": ["Zhian He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Zhian", "Eric Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo:Eric"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
