During each updating step, Kaczmarz chooses a hyperplane based on an individual equation and projects the current estimate for the exact solution onto that space to get a new estimate. Many vairants of Kaczmarz algorithms are proposed on how to choose better hyperplanes. Using the property of randomly sampled data in high-dimensional space, we propose an accelerated algorithm based on clustering information to improve block Kaczmarz and Kaczmarz via Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate convergence improvement on block Kaczmarz algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Yujun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yujun", "Kaichun Mo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mo:Kaichun", "Haishan Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Haishan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
