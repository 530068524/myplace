{"title": "Towards temporal access control in cloud computing.", "fields": ["encryption", "server", "data access", "authorization", "bitwise operation"], "abstract": "Access control is one of the most important security mechanisms in cloud computing. Attribute-based access control provides a flexible approach that allows data owners to integrate data access policies within the encrypted data. However, little work has been done to explore temporal attributes in specifying and enforcing the data owner's policy and the data user's privileges in cloud-based environments. In this paper, we present an efficient temporal access control encryption scheme for cloud services with the help of cryptographic integer comparisons and a proxy-based re-encryption mechanism on the current time. We also provide a dual comparative expression of integer ranges to extend the power of attribute expression for implementing various temporal constraints. We prove the security strength of the proposed scheme and our experimental results not only validate the effectiveness of our scheme, but also show that the proposed integer comparison scheme performs significantly better than previous bitwise comparison scheme.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Yan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0010:Yan", "Hongxin Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Hongxin", "Gail-Joon Ahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahn:Gail=Joon", "Dijiang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Dijiang", "Shan-Biao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shan=Biao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
