Our method consists of a multiple-scale multiple-image generative model, which jointly estimates the foreground and background appearance distributions from several images, in a non-supervised manner. In contrast to other co-segmentation methods, our approach does not require the images to have similar foregrounds and different backgrounds to function properly. Region matching is applied to exploit inter-image information by establishing correspondences between the common objects that appear in the scene. Moreover, computing many-to-many associations of regions allow further applications, like recognition of object parts across images. We report results on iCoseg, a challenging dataset that presents extreme variability in camera viewpoint, illumination and object deformations and poses. We also show that our method is robust against large intra-class variability in the MSRC database.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 C.
