{"title": "CLAMP: Practical Prevention of Large-Scale Data Leaks.", "fields": ["scripting language", "sql injection", "compromise", "application software", "web server"], "abstract": "Providing online access to sensitive data makes web servers lucrative targets for attackers. A compromise of any of the web server's scripts, applications, or operating system can leak the sensitive data of millions of customers. Unfortunately, many systems for stopping data leaks require considerable effort from application developers, hindering their adoption.In this work, we investigate how such leaks can be prevented with minimal developer effort. We propose CLAMP, an architecture for preventing data leaks even in the presence of web server compromises or SQL injection attacks. CLAMP protects sensitive data by enforcing strong access control on user data and by isolating code running on behalf of different users. By focusing on minimizing developer effort, we arrive at an architecture that allows developers to use familiar operating systems, servers, and scripting languages, while making relatively few changes to application code -- less than 50 lines in our applications.", "citation": "Citations (112)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Bryan Parno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parno:Bryan", "Jonathan M.
