The system allows users to visualize a lecture as a series of segments represented by keyword clouds, with relations to other similar lectures and segments. Segmentation is performed using a multi-factor algorithm which takes advantage of the audio (through automatic speech recognition and word-based segmentation) and video (through the detection of actions such as writing on the blackboard). The similarity across segments and lectures is computed using a content-based recommendation algorithm. Overall, the graph-based representation of segment similarity appears to be a promising and cost-effective approach to navigating lecture databases.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Idiap Research Institute", "Idiap Research Institute", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Heinrich Hertz Institute", "Klewel SA, Mart ... ny, Switzerland"], "authors": ["Chidansh Amitkumar Bhatt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhatt:Chidansh_Amitkumar", "Andrei Popescu-Belis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popescu=Belis:Andrei", "Maryam Habibi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habibi:Maryam", "Sandy Ingram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ingram:Sandy", "Stefano Masneri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masneri:Stefano", "Fergus McInnes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McInnes:Fergus", "Nikolaos Pappas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pappas:Nikolaos", "Oliver Schreer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schreer:Oliver"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
