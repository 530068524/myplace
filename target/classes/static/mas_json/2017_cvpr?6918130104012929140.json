A robust convolutional network is introduced for simultaneous vehicle detection, part localization, visibility characterization and 3D dimension estimation. Its architecture is based on a new coarse-to-fine object proposal that boosts the vehicle detection. Moreover, the Deep MANTA network is able to localize vehicle parts even if these parts are not visible. In the inference, the networks outputs are used by a real time robust pose estimation algorithm for fine orientation estimation and 3D vehicle localization. We show in experiments that our method outperforms monocular state-of-the-art approaches on vehicle detection, orientation and 3D location tasks on the very challenging KITTI benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Blaise Pascal University", "Blaise Pascal University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Florian Chabot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chabot:Florian", "Mohamed Chaouch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaouch:Mohamed", "Jaonary Rabarisoa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabarisoa:Jaonary", "C\u00e9line Teuli\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teuli=egrave=re:C=eacute=line", "Thierry Chateau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chateau:Thierry"], "pages": 10}
