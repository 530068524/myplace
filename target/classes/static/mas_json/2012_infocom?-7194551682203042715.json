Our method has time and space complexity O(N\u00b7k) for a network with N channels and k secondary users, while applying classic methods requires exponential time complexity. We prove that, even when channel states are selected by adversary (thus non-stochastic), it results in a total regret uniformly upper bounded by \u0398(\u221aTN logN), w.h.p, for communication lasts for T timeslots. Our protocol can be implemented in a distributed manner due to the nonstochastic channel assumption. Our experiments show that our schemes achieve almost optimal throughput compared with an optimal static strategy, and perform significantly better than previous methods in many settings.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "University of Science and Technology, Sana'a", "University of Science and Technology, Sana'a", "Nanjing University", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Panlong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Panlong", "Yubo Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Yubo", "Lizhao You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Lizhao", "Shaojie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shaojie", "Qiuyuan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Qiuyuan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
