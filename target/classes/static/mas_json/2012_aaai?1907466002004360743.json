{"title": "A First-Order Interpreter for Knowledge-Based Golog with Sensing based on Exact Progression and Limited Reasoning.", "fields": ["implementation", "unique name assumption", "programmer", "cognitive robotics", "situation calculus"], "abstract": "While founded on the situation calculus, current implementations of Golog are mainly based on the closed-world assumption or its dynamic versions or the domain closure assumption. Also, they are almost exclusively based on regression. In this paper, we propose a first-order interpreter for knowledge-based Golog with sensing based on exact progression and limited reasoning. We assume infinitely many unique names and handle first-order disjunctive information in the form of the so-called proper+ KBs. Our implementation is based on the progression and limited reasoning algorithms for proper+ KBs proposed by Liu, Lakemeyer and Levesque. To improve efficiency, we implement the two algorithms by grounding via a trick based on the unique name assumption. The interpreter is online but the programmer can use two operators to specify offline execution for parts of programs. The search operator returns a conditional plan, while the planning operator is used when local closed-world information is available and calls a modern planner to generate a sequence of actions.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Yi Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Yi", "Minghui Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Minghui", "Naiqi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Naiqi", "Yongmei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Yongmei"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
