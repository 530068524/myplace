Since it is NP-hard, relaxation models are required. In this paper, we first formulate the QAP from the match selection point of view; and then propose a local sparse model for matching problem. Our local sparse matching (LSM) method has the following advantages: (1) It is parameter-free; (2) It generates a local sparse solution which is closer to a discrete matrix than most other continuous relaxation methods for the matching problem. (3) The one-to-one matching constraints are better maintained in LSM solution. Promising experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed LSM method.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Anhui University", "Anhui University", "University of Texas at Arlington", "Anhui University"], "authors": ["Bo Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0002:Bo", "Jin Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jin", "Chris H.
