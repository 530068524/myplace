{"title": "Comprehensive understanding of TCP Incast problem.", "fields": ["data center", "computer network", "distributed computing", "throughput", "timeout"], "abstract": "Since TCP Incast has been identified as a catastrophic problem in many typical data center applications, a lot of efforts have been made to analyze or solve it. The analysis work intends to model Incast problem from certain perspective, and the solutions try to solve the problem through designing enhanced mechanisms or algorithms. However, the proposed models are either closely coupled with particular protocol version or dependent on empirical observations, and the solutions cannot eliminate Incast problem entirely because the underlying issues are not identified completely. There is little work which attempts to close the gap between \u201canalyzing\u201d and \u201csolving\u201d, and present a comprehensive understanding. In this paper, we provide an in-depth understanding of how TCP Incast problem happens. We build up an interpretive model which emphasizes particularly on describing qualitatively how various factors, including system parameters and mechanism variables, affect network performances in Incast traffic pattern, but not on calculating the accurate throughput. With this model, we give plausible explanations why the various solutions for TCP Incast problem can help, but do not solve it entirely.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Cisco Systems, Inc."], "authors": ["Wen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wen", "Fengyuan Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Fengyuan", "Jing Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Jing", "Chuang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chuang", "Kevin Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Kevin", "Fred Baker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baker:Fred"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
