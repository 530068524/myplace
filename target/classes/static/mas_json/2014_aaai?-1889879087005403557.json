In Constraint Programming, the recently introduced bi-objective Pareto constraint allows one to solve bi-objective combinatorial optimization problems exactly. Using this constraint, every non-dominated solution is collected in a single tree-search while pruning subtrees that cannot lead to a non-dominated solution. This paper introduces a simpler and more efficient filtering algorithm for the bi-objective Pareto constraint. The efficiency of this algorithm is experimentally confirmed on classical bi-objective benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain"], "authors": ["Renaud Hartert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartert:Renaud", "Pierre Schaus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaus:Pierre"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 6}
