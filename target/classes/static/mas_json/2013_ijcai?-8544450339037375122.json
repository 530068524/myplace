We analyze the ability of top-k vote elicitation to correctly determine true winners, with high probability, given probabilistic models of voter preferences and candidate availability. We provide bounds on the minimal value of k required to determine the correct winner under the plurality and Borda voting rules, considering both worst-case preference profiles and profiles drawn from the impartial culture and Mallows probabilistic models. We also derive conditions under which the special case of zero-elicitation (i.e., k = 0) produces the correct winner. We provide empirical results that confirm the value of top-k voting.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Joel Oren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oren:Joel", "Yuval Filmus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filmus:Yuval", "Craig Boutilier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boutilier:Craig"], "pages": 8}
