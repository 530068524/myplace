Exploiting the connection between manifold geometry, represented by the Riemannian metric, and the Laplace-Beltrami operator, we set epps by optimizing the Laplacian's ability to preserve the geometry of the data. Experiments show that this principled approach is effective and robust", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Dominique Joncas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joncas:Dominique", "Marina Meila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meila:Marina", "James McQueen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McQueen:James"], "pages": 10}
