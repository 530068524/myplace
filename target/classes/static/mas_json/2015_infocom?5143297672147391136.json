{"title": "On heterogeneous neighbor discovery in wireless sensor networks.", "fields": ["neighbor discovery protocol", "duty cycle", "asynchronous communication", "granularity", "clock synchronization"], "abstract": "Neighbor discovery plays a crucial role in the formation of wireless sensor networks and mobile networks where the power of sensors (or mobile devices) is constrained. Due to the difficulty of clock synchronization, many asynchronous protocols based on wake-up scheduling have been developed over the years in order to enable timely neighbor discovery between neighboring sensors while saving energy. However, existing protocols are not fine-grained enough to support all heterogeneous battery duty cycles, which can lead to a more rapid deterioration of long-term battery health for those without support. Existing research can be broadly divided into two categories according to their neighbor-discovery techniques \u2014 the quorum based protocols and the co-primality based protocols. In this paper, we propose two neighbor discovery protocols, called Hedis and Todis, that optimize the duty cycle granularity of quorum and co-primality based protocols respectively, by enabling the finest-grained control of heterogeneous duty cycles. We compare the two optimal protocols via analytical and simulation results, which show that although the optimal co-primality based protocol (Todis) is simpler in its design, the optimal quorum based protocol (Hedis) has a better performance since it has a lower relative error rate and smaller discovery delay, while still allowing the sensor nodes to wake up at a more infrequent rate.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Peking University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Peking University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Lin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0003:Lin", "Ruolin Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Ruolin", "Kaigui Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Kaigui", "Lin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0002:Lin", "Mario Gerla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerla:Mario", "Tao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0004:Tao", "Xiaoming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiaoming"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
