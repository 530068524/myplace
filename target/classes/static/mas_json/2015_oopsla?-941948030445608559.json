Any approach must solve an underlying dynamic graph reachability problem, for which the best algorithms have near-cubic worst-case runtime complexity, and, hence, previous work does not scale to programs with millions of lines of code. In this work, we present a novel approach for solving the field-sensitive points-to problem for Java with the means of (1) a transitive-closure data-structure, and (2) a pre-computed set of potentially matching load/store pairs to accelerate the fix-point calculation. Experimentation on Java benchmarks validates the superior performance of our approach over the standard context-free language reachability implementations. Our approach computes a points-to index for the OpenJDK with over 1.5 billion tuples in under a minute.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Massey University", "University of Sydney", "Oracle Corporation"], "authors": ["Jens Dietrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dietrich:Jens", "Nicholas Hollingum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hollingum:Nicholas", "Bernhard Scholz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scholz:Bernhard"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2015", "pages": 17}
