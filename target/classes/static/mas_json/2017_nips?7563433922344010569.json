{"title": "Learning Identifiable Gaussian Bayesian Networks in Polynomial Time and Sample Complexity.", "fields": ["conditional independence", "adjacency list", "gaussian", "directed acyclic graph", "markov blanket"], "abstract": "Learning the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure of a Bayesian network from observational data is a notoriously difficult problem for which many non-identifiability and hardness results are known. In this paper we propose a provably polynomial-time algorithm for learning sparse Gaussian Bayesian networks with equal noise variance --- a class of Bayesian networks for which the DAG structure can be uniquely identified from observational data --- under high-dimensional settings. We show that $O(k^4 \\log p)$ number of samples suffices for our method to recover the true DAG structure with high probability, where $p$ is the number of variables and $k$ is the maximum Markov blanket size. We obtain our theoretical guarantees under a condition called \\emph{restricted strong adjacency faithfulness} (RSAF), which is strictly weaker than strong faithfulness --- a condition that other methods based on conditional independence testing need for their success. The sample complexity of our method matches the information-theoretic limits in terms of the dependence on $p$. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic experiments.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Asish Ghoshal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghoshal:Asish", "Jean Honorio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Honorio:Jean"], "pages": 10}
