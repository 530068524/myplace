{"title": "Customization bias in decision support systems.", "fields": ["decision support system", "data mining", "computer science", "personalization"], "abstract": "Many Decision Support Systems (DSS) afford customization of inputs or algorithms before generating recommendations to a decision maker. This paper describes an experiment in which users make decisions assisted by recommendations of a DSS in a fantasy baseball game. This experiment shows that the act of customizing a DSS can lead to biased decision making. I show that users who believe they have customized a DSS's recommendation algorithm are more likely to follow the recommendations regardless of their accuracy. I also show that this customization bias is the result of using a DSS to seek confirmatory information in a recommendation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Michigan State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jacob Solomon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solomon:Jacob"], "pages": 10}
