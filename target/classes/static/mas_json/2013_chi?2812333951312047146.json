We developed a process to identify Regularly Visited Patches (RVP) and a set of metrics to characterize and measure their spatial patterns. Using a large dataset of Foursquare check-ins as a test bed, we show that RVP analysis reveals fundamental patterns of human mobility and will lead to promising research with strong implications for businesses.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Pitney Bowes", "placenous.com,  ... onnecticut, USA"], "authors": ["Yan Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Yan", "Jun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0008:Jun"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
