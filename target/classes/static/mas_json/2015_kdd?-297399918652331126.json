Most of the previous work has attempted to predict the future based on the current  value  of a stream. However, for many problems the actual values are irrelevant, whereas the  shape  of the current time series pattern may foretell the future. The handful of research efforts that consider this variant of the problem have met with limited success. In particular, it is now understood that most of these efforts allow the discovery of spurious rules. We believe the reason why rule discovery in real-valued time series has failed thus far is because most efforts have more or less indiscriminately applied the ideas of  symbolic  stream rule discovery to  real-valued  rule discovery. In this work, we show why these ideas are not directly suitable for rule discovery in time series. Beyond our novel definitions/representations, which allow for meaningful and extendable specifications of rules, we further show novel algorithms that allow us to quickly discover high quality rules in very large datasets that accurately predict the occurrence of future events.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside"], "authors": ["Mohammad Shokoohi-Yekta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shokoohi=Yekta:Mohammad", "Yanping Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0005:Yanping", "Bilson J.
