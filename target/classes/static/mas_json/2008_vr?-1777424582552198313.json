Our approach uses a generic facial motion model which represents deformations of a prototype face during speech. We have developed an HMM-based facial animation algorithm which takes into account both lexical stress and coarticulation. This algorithm produces realistic animations of the prototype facial surface from either text or speech. The generic facial motion model can be transformed to a novel face geometry using a set of corresponding points between the prototype face surface and the novel face. Given a face photograph, a small number of manually selected features in the photograph are used to deform the prototype face surface. The deformed surface is then used to animate the face in the photograph. We show several examples of avatars that are driven by text and speech inputs.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Dmitri Bitouk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bitouk:Dmitri", "Shree K.
