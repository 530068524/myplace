We establish two approaches for achieving differential privacy, provide a theoretical analysis of the privacy and utility of the two algorithms, and show promising results on simple empirical examples.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "McGill University", "McGill University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Borja Balle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balle:Borja", "Maziar Gomrokchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gomrokchi:Maziar", "Doina Precup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Precup:Doina"], "pages": 9}
