To the best of our knowledge, this problem is unsolved. The proposed approach extends point correspondence-based techniques with linear constraints derived from local affine transformations. The obtained multivariate polynomial system is efficiently solved by the hidden-variable technique. Observing the geometry of local affinities, we introduce novel conditions eliminating invalid roots. To select the best one out of the remaining candidates, a root selection technique is proposed outperforming the recent ones especially in case of high-level noise. The proposed 2-point algorithm is validated on both synthetic data and 104 publicly available real image pairs. A Matlab implementation of the proposed solution is included in the paper.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Daniel Barath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barath:Daniel", "Tekla Toth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toth:Tekla", "Levente Hajder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hajder:Levente"], "pages": 9}
