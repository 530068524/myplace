The advent of webcam tracking technologies made head motion available on every desktop, for any 3D game, calling for revised methods of handling user head motion in new, non-immersive settings. We present several novel techniques of using head motion in 3D social games. We show that head tracking is not only a useful, but also an enabling technology, that creates new means of interaction between players, makes gameplay more personal and game controls more flexible.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Samsung", "Sunflower Research Labs"], "authors": ["Andrei Sherstyuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sherstyuk:Andrei", "Anton Treskunov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Treskunov:Anton"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
