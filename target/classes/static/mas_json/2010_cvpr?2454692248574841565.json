{"title": "Two perceptually motivated strategies for shape classification.", "fields": ["active shape model", "contextual image classification", "data set", "shape analysis", "transform coding"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose two new, perceptually motivated strategies to better measure the similarity of 2D shape instances that are in the form of closed contours. The first strategy handles shapes that can be decomposed into a base structure and a set of inward or outward pointing \u201cstrand\u201d structures, where a strand structure represents a very thin, elongated shape part attached to the base structure. The similarity of two such shape contours can be better described by measuring the similarity of their base structures and strand structures in different ways. The second strategy handles shapes that exhibit good bilateral symmetry. In many cases, such shapes are invariant to a certain level of scaling transformation along their symmetry axis. In our experiments, we show that these two strategies can be integrated into available shape matching methods to improve the performance of shape classification on several widely-used shape data sets.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of South Carolina", "University of South Carolina", "University of South Carolina", "University of South Carolina"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Andrew Temlyakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Temlyakov:Andrew", "Brent C.
