Graph nodes represent grammar-based chart specifications and edges rep- resent edits that transform one chart to another. We weight edges with an estimated cost of the difficulty of interpreting a target visualization given a source visualization. We con- tribute (1) a method for deriving transition costs via a partial ordering of edit operations and the solution of a resulting lin- ear program, and (2) a global weighting term that rewards consistency across transition subsequences. In a controlled experiment, subjects rated visualization sequences covering a taxonomy of common transition types. In all but one case, GraphScape's highest-ranked suggestion aligns with subjects' top-rated sequences. Finally, we demonstrate applications of GraphScape to automatically sequence visualization presen- tations, elaborate transition paths between visualizations, and recommend design alternatives (e.g., to improve scalability while minimizing design changes).", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Younghoon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Younghoon", "Kanit Wongsuphasawat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wongsuphasawat:Kanit", "Jessica Hullman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hullman:Jessica", "Jeffrey Heer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heer:Jeffrey"], "pages": 11}
