However, we also found that users often had difficulties in maintaining their chosen management strategies due to lack of self-regulation. In this paper, we present NUGU, a group-based intervention app for improving self-regulation of limiting smartphone use through leveraging social support: groups of people limit their use together by sharing their limiting information. NUGU is designed based on  social cognitive theory , and it has been developed iteratively through two pilot tests. Our three-week user study ( n  = 62) demonstrated that compared with its non-social counterpart, the NUGU users' usage amount significantly decreased and their perceived level of managing disturbances improved. Furthermore, our exit interview confirmed that NUGU's design elements are effective for achieving limiting goals.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Furtwangen University", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Minsam Ko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ko:Minsam", "Subin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Subin", "Joonwon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joonwon", "Christian Heizmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heizmann:Christian", "Jinyoung Jeong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeong:Jinyoung", "Uichin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Uichin", "Daehee Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Daehee", "Koji Yatani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yatani:Koji", "Junehwa Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Junehwa", "Kyong-Mee Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Kyong=Mee"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
