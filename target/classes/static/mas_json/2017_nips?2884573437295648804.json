{"title": "Convolutional Phase Retrieval.", "fields": ["circular convolution", "binary logarithm", "restricted isometry property", "circulant matrix", "phase retrieval"], "abstract": "We study the convolutional phase retrieval problem, which asks us to recover an unknown signal ${\\mathbf x} $ of length $n$ from $m$ measurements consisting of the magnitude of its cyclic convolution with a known kernel $\\mathbf a$ of length $m$. This model is motivated by applications to channel estimation, optics, and underwater acoustic communication, where the signal of interest is acted on by a given channel/filter, and phase information is difficult or impossible to acquire. We show that when $\\mathbf a$ is random and $m \\geq \\Omega(\\frac{ \\| \\mathbf C_{\\mathbf x}\\|^2}{ \\|\\mathbf x\\|^2 } n \\mathrm{poly} \\log n)$, $\\mathbf x$ can be efficiently recovered up to a global phase using a combination of spectral initialization and generalized gradient descent. The main challenge is coping with dependencies in the measurement operator; we overcome this challenge by using ideas from decoupling theory, suprema of chaos processes and the restricted isometry property of random circulant matrices, and recent analysis for alternating minimizing methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Columbia University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Qing Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Qing", "Yuqian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yuqian", "Yonina C.
