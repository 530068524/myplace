Thus mechanisms to efficiently allocate the available spectrum are of interest. In this paper, we model the radio spectrum allocation problem as a sealed-bid reserve auction, and propose SMALL, which is a Strategy-proof Mechanism for radio spectrum ALLocation. Furthermore, we extend SMALL to adapt to multi-radio spectrum buyers, which can bid for more than one radio.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Fan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Fan", "Nitin H.
