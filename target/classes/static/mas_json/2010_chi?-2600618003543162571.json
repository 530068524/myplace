{"title": "Graspables revisited: multi-touch vs. tangible input for tabletop displays in acquisition and manipulation tasks.", "fields": ["multi touch", "user interface", "interface design", "adaptability", "tangible user interface"], "abstract": "We present an experimental comparison of multi-touch and tangible user interfaces for basic interface actions. Twelve participants completed manipulation and acquisition tasks on an interactive surface in each of three conditions: tangible user interface; multi-touch; and mouse and puck. We found that interface control objects in the tangible condition were easiest to acquire and, once acquired, were easier/more accurate to manipulate. Further qualitative analysis suggested that in the evaluated tasks tangibles offer greater adaptability of control and specifically highlighted a problem of exit error that can undermine fine-grained control in multi-touch interactions. We discuss the implications of these findings for interface design.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Nottingham", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Philip Tuddenham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tuddenham:Philip", "David S.
