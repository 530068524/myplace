{"title": "CASPAR: Breaking Serialization in Lock-Free Multicore Synchronization.", "fields": ["double ended queue", "serialization", "multi core processor", "queue", "non blocking algorithm"], "abstract": "In multicores, performance-critical synchronization is increasingly performed in a  lock-free  manner using atomic instructions such as CAS or LL/SC. However, when many processors synchronize on the same variable, performance can still degrade significantly. Contending writes get serialized, creating a non-scalable condition. Past proposals that build hardware queues of synchronizing processors do not fundamentally solve this problem---at best, they help to  efficiently serialize  the contending writes.   This paper proposes a novel architecture that  breaks  the serialization of hardware queues and enables the queued processors to perform lock-free synchronization  in parallel . The architecture, called  CASPAR , is able to (1) execute the CASes in the queued-up processors in parallel through eager forwarding of expected values, and (2) validate the CASes in parallel and dequeue groups of processors at a time. The result is highly-scalable synchronization. We evaluate CASPAR with simulations of a 64-core chip. Compared to existing proposals with hardware queues, CASPAR improves the throughput of kernels by 32% on average, and reduces the execution time of the sections considered in lock-free versions of applications by 47% on average. This makes these sections 2.5x faster than in the original applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Tanmay Gangwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gangwani:Tanmay", "Adam Morrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morrison_0001:Adam", "Josep Torrellas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torrellas:Josep"], "pages": 16}
