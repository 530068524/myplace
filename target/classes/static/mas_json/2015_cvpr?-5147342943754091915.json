{"title": "Part-based modelling of compound scenes from images.", "fields": ["computer vision", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We propose a method to recover the structure of a compound scene from multiple silhouettes. Structure is expressed as a collection of 3D primitives chosen from a predefined library, each with an associated pose. This has several advantages over a volume or mesh representation both for estimation and the utility of the recovered model. The main challenge in recovering such a model is the combinatorial number of possible arrangements of parts. We address this issue by exploiting the intrinsic structure and sparsity of the problem, and show that our method scales to scenes constructed from large libraries of parts.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University College London", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Anton van den Hengel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hengel:Anton_van_den", "Chris Russell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Russell:Chris", "Anthony R.
