To do so a general, abstract framework for studying behavioural relations taking values over quantales is introduced according to Lawvere's analysis of generalised metric spaces. Barr's notion of relator (or lax extension) is then extended to quantale-valued relations, adapting and extending results from the field of monoidal topology. Abstract notions of quantale-valued effectful applicative similarity and bisimilarity are then defined and proved to be a compatible generalised metric (in the sense of Lawvere) and pseudometric, respectively, under mild conditions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Google"], "authors": ["Francesco Gavazzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavazzo:Francesco"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
