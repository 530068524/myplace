{"title": "The Data Stream Space Complexity of Cascaded Norms.", "fields": ["approximation error", "integer", "approximation algorithm", "histogram", "level set"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating cascaded aggregates over a matrix presented as a sequence of updates in a data stream. A cascaded aggregate P \u00b1Q is defined by evaluating aggregate Q repeatedly over each row of the matrix, and then evaluating aggregate P over the resulting vector of values. This problem was introduced by Cormode andMuthukrishnan, PODS, 2005 [CM]. We analyze the space complexity of estimating cascaded norms on an n \u00a3d matrix to within a small relative error. Let Lp denote the p-th norm, where p is a non-negative integer. We abbreviate the cascaded normLk \u00b1Lp by Lk,p . (1) For any constant k \u00b8 p \u00b8 2, we obtain a 1-pass e O(n1i2/kd1i2/p )-space algorithm for estimating Lk,p . This is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors and resolves an open question of [CM] regarding the space complexity of L4,2. We also obtain 1-pass space-optimal algorithms for estimating L1,k and Lk,1. (2)We prove a space lower bound of\u00ad(n1i1/k ) on estimating Lk,0 and Lk,1, resolving an open question due to Indyk, IITK Data StreamsWorkshop (Problem 8), 2006. We also resolve two more questions of [CM] concerning Lk,2 estimation and block heavy hitter problems. Ganguly, Bansal and Dube (FAW, 2008) claimed an e O(1)-space algorithm for estimating Lk,p for any k,p 2 [0,2]. Our lower bounds show this claimis incorrect.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["T. S. Jayram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jayram:T=_S=", "David P.
