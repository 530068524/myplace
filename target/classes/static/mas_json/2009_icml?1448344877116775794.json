We discuss two recently introduced sampling-based spectral decomposition techniques: the Nystrom and the Column-sampling methods. We present a theoretical comparison between the two methods and provide novel insights regarding their suitability for various applications. We then provide experimental results motivated by this theory. Finally, we propose an efficient adaptive sampling technique to select  informative  columns from the original matrix. This novel technique outperforms standard sampling methods on a variety of datasets.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "departments": ["Google", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "authors": ["Sanjiv Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Sanjiv", "Mehryar Mohri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohri:Mehryar", "Ameet Talwalkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talwalkar:Ameet"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
