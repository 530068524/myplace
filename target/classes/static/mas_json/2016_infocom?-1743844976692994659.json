As the number of new mobile apps continues to grow at a rapid pace, automatic classification of the apps has become an increasingly important problem to facilitate browsing, searching, and recommending them. This paper presents a framework that automatically labels apps with a richer and more detailed categorization and uses the labeled apps to study the app market. Leveraging a fine-grained, hierarchical ontology as a guide, we developed a framework not only to label the apps with finegrained categorical information but also to induce a customized class hierarchy optimized for mobile app classification. With the classification accuracy of 93%, large-scale categorization conducted with our framework on 168,000 Google Play apps discovers novel inter-class relationships among categories of Google Play market.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Cisco Systems, Inc.", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "Michigan State University"], "authors": ["Xi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xi", "Han Hee Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Han_Hee", "Mario Baldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baldi:Mario", "Pang-Ning Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Pang=Ning"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
