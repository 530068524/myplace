{"title": "Homomorphic SIM ^2 D Operations: Single Instruction Much More Data.", "fields": ["homomorphic encryption", "ciphertext", "chinese remainder theorem", "plaintext", "laurent polynomial", "computer science", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "In 2014, Smart and Vercauteren introduced a packing technique for homomorphic encryption schemes by decomposing the plaintext space using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. This technique allows to encrypt multiple data values simultaneously into one ciphertext and execute Single Instruction Multiple Data operations homomorphically. In this paper we improve and generalize their results by introducing a flexible Laurent polynomial encoding technique and by using a more fine-grained CRT decomposition of the plaintext space. The Laurent polynomial encoding provides a convenient common framework for all conventional ways in which input data types can be represented, e.g. finite field elements, integers, rationals, floats and complex numbers. Our methods greatly increase the packing capacity of the plaintext space, as well as one\u2019s flexibility in optimizing the system parameters with respect to efficiency and/or security.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Wouter Castryck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castryck:Wouter", "Ilia Iliashenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iliashenko:Ilia", "Frederik Vercauteren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vercauteren:Frederik"], "pages": 22}
