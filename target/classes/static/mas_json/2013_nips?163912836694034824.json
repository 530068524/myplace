Here we present a Hierarchical Bayesian model based on com-positionality and causality that can learn a wide range of natural (although simple) visual concepts, generalizing in human-like ways from just one image. We evaluated performance on a challenging one-shot classification task, where our model achieved a human-level error rate while substantially outperforming two deep learning models. We also tested the model on another conceptual task, generating new examples, by using a \"visual Turing test\" to show that our model produces human-like performance.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Toronto", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Brenden M.
