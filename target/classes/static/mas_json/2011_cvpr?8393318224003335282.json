While there are many good tracking systems, there are fewer methods that can identify the tracked players. Player identification is challenging in such videos due to blurry facial features (due to fast camera motion and low-resolution) and rarely visible jersey numbers (which, when visible, are deformed due to player movements). We introduce a new system consisting of three components: a robust tracking system, a robust person identification system, and a conditional random field (CRF) model that can perform joint probabilistic inference about the player identities. The resulting system is able to achieve a player recognition accuracy up to 85% on unlabeled NBA basketball clips.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wei-Lwun Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Wei=Lwun", "Jo-Anne Ting.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Ting:Jo=Anne", "Kevin P.
