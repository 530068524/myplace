Several techniques have been proposed to find violations of such protocols based on mined specifications. However, existing techniques either focus on single-object protocols or on particular kinds of bugs, such as missing method calls. There is no practical technique to find multi-object protocol bugs without a priori known specifications. In this paper, we combine a dynamic analysis that infers multi-object protocols and a static checker of API usage constraints into a fully automatic protocol conformance checker. The combined system statically detects illegal uses of an API without human-written specifications. Our approach finds 41 bugs and code smells in mature, real-world Java programs with a true positive rate of 51%. Furthermore, we show that the analysis reveals bugs not found by state of the art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Michael Pradel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pradel:Michael", "Ciera Jaspan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaspan:Ciera", "Jonathan Aldrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aldrich:Jonathan", "Thomas R.
