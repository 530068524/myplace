We observe a parallel between the challenges introduced by this emerging flash hardware and the problems that were faced with underutilized server hardware about a decade ago. Borrowing ideas from hardware virtualization, we present a novel storage system design that partitions functionality into an address virtualization layer for high performance network-attached flash, and a hosted environment for implementing scalable protocol implementations. Our system targets the storage of virtual machine images for enterprise environments, and we demonstrate dynamic scale to over a million IO operations per second using NFSv3 in 13\u00b5 of rack space, including switching.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Coho Data", "Coho Data", "Coho Data", "Coho Data", "Coho Data"], "authors": ["Brendan Cully.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cully:Brendan", "Jake Wires.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wires:Jake", "Dutch T.
