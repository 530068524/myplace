{"title": "Weightless: Lossy weight encoding for deep neural network compression.", "fields": ["fold", "lossy compression", "encoding", "probabilistic logic", "weightless"], "abstract": "The large memory requirements of deep neural networks strain the capabilities of many devices, limiting their deployment and adoption. Model compression methods effectively reduce the memory requirements of these models, usually through applying transformations such as weight pruning or quantization. In this paper, we present a novel scheme for lossy weight encoding which complements conventional compression techniques. The encoding is based on the Bloomier filter, a probabilistic data structure that can save space at the cost of introducing random errors. Leveraging the ability of neural networks to tolerate these imperfections and by re-training around the errors, the proposed technique, Weightless, can compress DNN weights by up to 496x; with the same model accuracy, this results in up to a 1.51x improvement over the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Brandon Reagen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reagen:Brandon", "Udit Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Udit", "Bob Adolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adolf:Bob", "Michael Mitzenmacher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitzenmacher:Michael", "Alexander M.
