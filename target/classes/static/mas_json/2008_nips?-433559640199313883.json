We discuss the application of this technique to fast label prediction on a generic graph. We approximate the graph with a spanning tree and then we predict with the kernel perceptron. We address the approximation of the graph with either a minimum spanning tree or a shortest path tree. The fast computation of the pseudoinverse enables us to address prediction problems on large graphs. We present experiments on two web-spam classification tasks, one of which includes a graph with 400,000 vertices and more than 10,000,000 edges. The results indicate that the accuracy of our technique is competitive with previous methods using the full graph information.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Mark Herbster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herbster:Mark", "Massimiliano Pontil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pontil:Massimiliano", "Sergio Rojas Galeano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galeano:Sergio_Rojas"], "pages": 8}
