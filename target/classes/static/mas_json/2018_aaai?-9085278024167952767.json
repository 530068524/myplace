However, existing neural approaches are either user-based or item-based, which cannot leverage all the underlying information explicitly. We propose CF-UIcA, a neural co-autoregressive model for CF tasks, which exploits the structural correlation in the domains of both users and items. The co-autoregression allows extra desired properties to be incorporated for different tasks. Furthermore, we develop an efficient stochastic learning algorithm to handle large scale datasets. We evaluate CF-UIcA on two popular benchmarks: MovieLens 1M and Netflix, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in both rating prediction and top-N recommendation tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of CF-UIcA.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Chao Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Chao", "Chongxuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chongxuan", "Yin Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yin", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun", "Bo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0010:Bo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
