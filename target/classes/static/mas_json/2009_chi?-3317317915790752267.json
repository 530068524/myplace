{"title": "Learning to predict information needs: context-aware display as a cognitive aid and an assessment tool.", "fields": ["information needs", "cognition", "multimedia", "sequence learning", "automation"], "abstract": "We discuss the problem of assessing and aiding user performance in dynamic tasks that require rapid selection among multiple information sources. Motivated by research in human sequential learning, we develop a system that learns by observation to predict the information a user desires in different contexts. The model decides when the display should be updated, which is akin to the problem of scene segmentation, and then selects the situationally relevant information display. The model reduces the cognitive burden of selecting situation-relevant displays. We evaluate the system in a tank video game environment and find that the system boosts user performance. The fit of the model to user data provides a quantitative assessment of user behavior, which is useful in assessing individual differences and the progression from novice- to expert-level proficiency. We discuss the relative benefits of adopting a learning approach to predicting information preferences and possible avenues to reduce the negative consequences of automation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Bradley C.
