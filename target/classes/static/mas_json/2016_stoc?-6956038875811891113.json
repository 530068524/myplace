Given a matrix  A  \u2208  R  m\u00d7n , a rank parameter k A ), and an accuracy parameter 0 U  for which || A - UU  T  A || 2  F \u2264(1+e)|| A - A  k || 2  F  where  A  k \u2208 R  m\u00d7n  is the best rank-k approximation to  A .     Our contributions are summarized as follows: 1. In the arbitrary partition distributed model of Kannan et al. (COLT 2014), each of s machines holds a matrix  A  i  and  A =\u03a3 A  i . Each machine should output  U . Kannan et al. achieve O(skm/e)+poly(sk/e) words (of O(log(nm)) bits) communication. We obtain the improved bound of O(skm)+poly(sk/e) words, and show an optimal (up to low order terms) \u03a9(skm) lower bound. This resolves an open question in the literature. A poly(e -1 ) dependence is known to be required, but we separate this dependence from m.     2. In a more specific distributed model where each server receives a subset of columns of  A , we bypass the above lower bound when  A  is \u03c6- sparse  in each column. Here we obtain an O(sk\u03c6/e)+poly(sk/e) word protocol. Our communication is independent of the matrix dimensions, and achieves the guarantee that each server, in addition to outputting  U , outputs a subset of O(k/e) columns of  A  containing a  U  in its span (that is, for the first time, we solve distributed column subset selection). Additionally, we show a matching \u03a9(sk\u03c6/e) lower bound for distributed column subset selection. Achieving our communication bound when  A  is sparse in general but not sparse in each column, is impossible.     3. In the streaming model of computation, in which the columns of the matrix  A  arrive one at a time, an algorithm of Liberty (KDD, 2013) with an improved analysis by Ghashami and Phillips (SODA, 2014) achieves O(km/e) \"real numbers\" space complexity. We improve this result, since our one-pass streaming PCA algorithm achieves an O(km/e)+poly(k/e) word space upper bound. This almost matches a known \u03a9(km/e) bit lower bound of Woodruff (NIPS, 2014). We show that with two passes over the columns of  A  one can achieve an O(km)+poly(k/e) word space upper bound; another lower bound of Woodruff (NIPS, 2014) shows that this is optimal for any constant number of passes (up to the poly(k/e) term and the distinction between words versus bits).     4. Finally, in turnstile streams, in which we receive entries of  A  one at a time in an arbitrary order, we describe an algorithm with O((m+n)ke -1 ) words of space. This improves the O((m+n)e -2 )ke -2 ) upper bound of Clarkson and Woodruff (STOC 2009), and matches their \u03a9((m+n)ke -1 ) word lower bound.     Notably, our results do not depend on the condition number or any singular value gaps of  A .", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Goldman Sachs", "IBM", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Christos Boutsidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boutsidis:Christos", "David P.
