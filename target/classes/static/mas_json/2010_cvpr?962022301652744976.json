Most existing state-of-the-art techniques rely on large sparse matrices such as the matting Laplacian [12]. However, solving these linear systems is often time-consuming, which is unfavored for the user interaction. In this paper, we propose a fast method for high quality matting. We first derive an efficient algorithm to solve a large kernel matting Laplacian. A large kernel propagates information more quickly and may improve the matte quality. To further reduce running time, we also use adaptive kernel sizes by a KD-tree trimap segmentation technique. A variety of experiments show that our algorithm provides high quality results and is 5 to 20 times faster than previous methods.", "citation": "Citations (116)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Microsoft", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kaiming He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Kaiming", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "pages": 8}
