{"title": "Analyzing visual attention during whole body interaction with public displays.", "fields": ["user experience design", "peripheral", "silhouette", "mirroring", "recall"], "abstract": "While whole body interaction can enrich user experience on public displays, it remains unclear how common visualizations of user representations impact users' ability to perceive content on the display. In this work we use a head-mounted eye tracker to record visual behavior of 25 users interacting with a public display game that uses a silhouette user representation, mirroring the users' movements. Results from visual attention analysis as well as post-hoc recall and recognition tasks on display contents reveal that visual attention is mostly on users' silhouette while peripheral screen elements remain largely unattended. In our experiment, content attached to the user representation attracted significantly more attention than other screen contents, while content placed at the top and bottom of the screen attracted significantly less. Screen contents attached to the user representation were also significantly better remembered than those at the top and bottom of the screen.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Max Planck Society", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Aarhus University"], "authors": ["Robert Walter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walter:Robert", "Andreas Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Andreas", "David Lindlbauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindlbauer:David", "Martin Schuessler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuessler:Martin", "J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:J=ouml=rg"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 5}
