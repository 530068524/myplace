{"title": "Large Displacement 3D Scene Flow with Occlusion Reasoning.", "fields": ["optical flow", "occlusion", "rgb color model", "point cloud", "smoothing"], "abstract": "The emergence of modern, affordable and accurate RGB-D sensors increases the need for single view approaches to estimate 3-dimensional motion, also known as scene flow. In this paper we propose a coarse-to-fine, dense, correspondence-based scene flow formulation that relies on explicit geometric reasoning to account for the effects of large displacements and to model occlusion. Our methodology enforces local motion rigidity at the level of the 3d point cloud without explicitly smoothing the parameters of adjacent neighborhoods. By integrating all geometric and photometric components in a single, consistent, occlusion-aware energy model, defined over overlapping, image-adaptive neighborhoods, our method can process fast motions and large occlusions areas, as present in challenging datasets like the MPI Sintel Flow Dataset, recently augmented with depth information. By explicitly modeling large displacements and occlusion, we can handle difficult sequences which cannot be currently processed by state of the art scene flow methods. We also show that by integrating depth information into the model, we can obtain correspondence fields with improved spatial support and sharper boundaries compared to the state of the art, large-displacement optical flow methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Romanian Academy", "Lund University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Andrei Zanfir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zanfir:Andrei", "Cristian Sminchisescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sminchisescu:Cristian"], "pages": 9}
