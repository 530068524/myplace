In other words, digital financial platforms are proving capable of supporting new relations between groups of people as well as offering new ways to organize money. Taking an HCI lens, we look at how some crowdfunding platform owners are approaching social innovation, not only at the level of supporting individual community initiatives, but at the broader level of using their platform to change societal behavior. Through four case studies, we show how crowdfunding has been chosen as a tool to redesign society by promoting environmental or social sustainability. We argue that the groups constituted through these interactions are not merely \"crowds\", but deliberate constellations built round a thing of interest (or \"paying publics\"). Our interviews with managers and owners explore how interactions with and around platforms work to achieve these ends and we conclude with design considerations.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Sussex", "Northumbria University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ann Light.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Light:Ann", "Jo Briggs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Briggs:Jo"], "pages": 13}
