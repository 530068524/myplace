{"title": "Super-KAVE: An immersive visualization tool for neutrino physics.", "fields": ["immersion", "mount", "neutrino", "neutrino detector", "data visualization"], "abstract": "Located under Japan's Mount Ikenoyama, the Super-Kamiokande (or \u201cSuper-K\u201d) neutrino detector is used to study neutrino particle physics. The Super-K detector consists of a cylindrical stainless steel tank (41.4m tall and 39.3m in diameter) holding 50,000 tons of water and 13,031 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). To view the data captured by these sensors, many physicists use 2D visualization tools which present the data color-coded on a deconstructed representation of the cylinder. Unfortunately, this deconstructed visualization makes it difficult for physicists to fully visualize patterns of neutrino interactions. To address this, we have developed a novel virtual reality (VR) application called \u201cSuper-KAVE\u201d, which uses a CAVE to immerse users in a lifesize representation of the Super-K detector. Super-KAVE displays the collocation of photon sensors and their color-coded data, provides a new visualization technique for neutrino-interaction patterns, and supports transitioning between data events. In this paper, we describe the Super-K detector and its data, discuss the design and implementation of our Super-KAVE application, and report on its expected uses.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Benjamin Izatt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Izatt:Benjamin", "Kate Scholberq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scholberq:Kate", "Ryan P.
