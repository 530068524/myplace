It is based on a new bisimulation invariant measure of complexity for parity games, called the register-index, which captures the complexity of the priority assignment. For fixed parameter k, the class of games with register-index bounded by k is solvable in polynomial time.   We show that the register-index of parity games of size n is bounded by O(log n) and derive a quasi-polynomial algorithm. Finally, we give a descriptive complexity account of the quasi-polynomial complexity of parity games: The winning regions of parity games with p priorities and register-index k are described by a modal \u03bc formula of which the complexity, as measured by its alternation depth, depends on k rather than p.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Kiel"], "authors": ["Karoliina Lehtinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehtinen:Karoliina"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
