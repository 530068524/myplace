{"title": "Interactive data exploration with smart drill-down.", "fields": ["operator", "tuple", "drill down", "optimization problem", "data exploration"], "abstract": "We present smart drill-down, an operator for interactively exploring a relational table to discover and summarize \u201cinteresting\u201d groups of tuples. Each group of tuples is described by a rule. For instance, the rule (a, b, \u2605, 1000) tells us that there are a thousand tuples with value a in the first column and b in the second column (and any value in the third column). Smart drill-down presents an analyst with a list of rules that together describe interesting aspects of the table. The analyst can tailor the definition of interesting, and can interactively apply smart drill-down on an existing rule to explore that part of the table. We demonstrate that the underlying optimization problems are NP-HARD, and describe an algorithm for finding the approximately optimal list of rules to display when the user uses a smart drill-down, and a dynamic sampling scheme for efficiently interacting with large tables. Finally, we perform experiments on real datasets on our experimental prototype to demonstrate the usefulness of smart drill-down and study the performance of our algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Manas Joglekar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joglekar:Manas", "Hector Garcia-Molina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia=Molina:Hector", "Aditya G.
