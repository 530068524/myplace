One such technique is sleep sets, which were originally introduced as a pruning technique for model checking, and which have recently been investigated on a theoretical level for planning. In this paper, we propose a generalization of sleep sets and prove its correctness. While the original sleep sets were based on the commutativity of operators, generalized sleep sets are based on a more general notion of operator sequence redundancy. As a result, our approach dominates the original sleep sets variant in terms of pruning power. On a practical level, our experimental evaluation shows the potential of sleep sets and their generalizations on a large and common set of planning benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Freiburg", "University of Basel"], "authors": ["Robert C.
