This model class can be viewed as a reparametrization of the SVM in a similar vein to the ?-SVM reparametrizing the classical (C-)SVM. It is not discriminative, but has a non-uniform marginal. We illustrate the benefits of this new view by re-deriving and re-investigating two established SVM-related algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Max Planck Society", "LIFE Biosystems ... elberg, Germany"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Vojtech Franc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Franc:Vojtech", "Alexander Zien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zien:Alexander", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard"], "pages": 8}
