The set of all high-density clusters form a hierarchy called the cluster tree of f. We present a procedure for estimating the cluster tree given samples from f. We give finite-sample convergence rates for our algorithm, as well as lower bounds on the sample complexity of this estimation problem.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Kamalika Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Kamalika", "Sanjoy Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Sanjoy"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
