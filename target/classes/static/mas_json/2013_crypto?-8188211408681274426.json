{"title": "Fuming Acid and Cryptanalysis: Handy Tools for Overcoming a Digital Locking and Access Control System.", "fields": ["lock", "proprietary protocol", "cryptographic primitive", "transponder"], "abstract": "We examine the widespread SimonsVoss digital locking system 3060 G2 that relies on an undisclosed, proprietary protocol to mutually authenticate transponders and locks. For assessing the security of the system, several tasks have to be performed: By decapsulating the used microcontrollers with acid and circumventing their read-out protection with UV-C light, the complete program code and data contained in door lock and transponder are extracted. As a second major step, the multi-pass challenge-response protocol and corresponding cryptographic primitives are recovered via low-level reverse-engineering. The primitives turn out to be based on DES in combination with a proprietary construction.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum"], "authors": ["Daehyun Strobel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strobel:Daehyun", "Benedikt Driessen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Driessen:Benedikt", "Timo Kasper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasper:Timo", "Gregor Leander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leander:Gregor", "David Oswald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oswald:David", "Falk Schellenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schellenberg:Falk", "Christof Paar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paar:Christof"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 18}
