To develop a richer characterization of use, we turned to a previously untapped source of data: YouTube videos. We collected and analyzed 187 non-commercial videos uploaded to YouTube that depicted a person with a physical disability interacting with a mainstream mobile touchscreen device. We coded the videos along a range of dimensions to characterize the interaction, the challenges encountered, and the adaptations being adopted in daily use. To complement the video data, we also invited the video uploaders to complete a survey on their ongoing use of touchscreen technology. Our findings show that, while many people with motor impairments find these devices empowering, accessibility issues still exist. In addition to providing implications for more accessible touchscreen design, we reflect on the application of user-generated content to study user interface design.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Lisa Anthony.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anthony:Lisa", "YooJin Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:YooJin", "Leah Findlater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Findlater:Leah"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
