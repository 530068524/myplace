Using the test, we prove the following two inapproximability results:1. Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture of Khot, given an n-vertex graph that has two disjoint independent sets of size (1/2-epsilon)n each, it is NP-hard to find an independent set of size delta n.2. Assuming a (new) stronger version of the Unique Games Conjecture, the scheduling problem of minimizing weighted completion time with precedence constraints is inapproximable within factor 2-epsilon.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["IBM", "New York University"], "authors": ["Nikhil Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Nikhil", "Subhash Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Subhash"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
