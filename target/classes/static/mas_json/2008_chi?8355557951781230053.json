To encourage contribution to an opt-in social networking site designed for employees, we have designed and implemented a feature that rewards contribution with points. In our evaluation of the impact of the system, we found that employees are initially motivated to add more content to the site. This paper presents the analysis and design of the point system, the results of our experiment, and our insights regarding future directions derived from our post-experiment user interviews.", "citation": "Citations (223)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rosta Farzan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farzan:Rosta", "Joan Morris DiMicco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DiMicco:Joan_Morris", "David R.
