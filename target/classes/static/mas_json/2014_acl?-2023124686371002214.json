{"title": "A Linear-Time Bottom-Up Discourse Parser with Constraints and Post-Editing.", "fields": ["viterbi decoder", "crfs", "top down and bottom up design", "time complexity", "parsing"], "abstract": "Text-level discourse parsing remains a challenge. The current state-of-the-art overall accuracy in relation assignment is 55.73%, achieved by Joty et al. (2013). However, their model has a high order of time complexity, and thus cannot be applied in practice. In this work, we develop a much faster model whose time complexity is linear in the number of sentences. Our model adopts a greedy bottom-up approach, with two linear-chain CRFs applied in cascade as local classifiers. To enhance the accuracy of the pipeline, we add additional constraints in the Viterbi decoding of the first CRF. In addition to efficiency, our parser also significantly outperforms the state of the art. Moreover, our novel approach of post-editing, which modifies a fully-built tree by considering information from constituents on upper levels, can further improve the accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Vanessa Wei Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Vanessa_Wei", "Graeme Hirst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirst:Graeme"], "pages": 11}
