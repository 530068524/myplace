AudioCanvas allows cameraphone users to interact directly with their own photos of printed media to receive audio feedback or narration. The use of a remote telephone-based service also allows our design to be used over a standard phone line, removing the need for data connections, which can be problematic in developing regions. We show the value of the technique via user evaluations in both a rural Indian village and a South African township.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Swansea University", "Swansea University", "Swansea University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Simon Robinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robinson:Simon", "Jennifer S.
