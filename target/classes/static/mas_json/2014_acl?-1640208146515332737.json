{"title": "Looking at Unbalanced Specialized Comparable Corpora for Bilingual Lexicon Extraction.", "fields": ["computer science", "artificial intelligence", "terminology extraction", "bilingual lexicon", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based on the implicit hypothesis that corpora are balanced. However, the historical contextbased projection method dedicated to this task is relatively insensitive to the sizes of each part of the comparable corpus. Within this context, we have carried out a study on the influence of unbalanced specialized comparable corpora on the quality of bilingual terminology extraction through different experiments. Moreover, we have introduced a regression model that boosts the observations of word cooccurrences used in the context-based projection method. Our results show that the use of unbalanced specialized comparable corpora induces a significant gain in the quality of extracted lexicons.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Nantes", "University of Nantes"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Emmanuel Morin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morin:Emmanuel", "Amir Hazem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazem:Amir"], "pages": 10}
