{"title": "A verification system for timed interval calculus.", "fields": ["formal verification", "specification language", "higher order logic", "notation", "prototype verification system"], "abstract": "Timed Interval Calculus (TIC) is a highly expressive set-based notation for specifying and reasoning about embedded real-time systems. However, it lacks mechanical proving support, as its verification usually involves infinite time intervals and continuous dynamics. In this paper, we develop a system based on a generic theorem prover, Prototype Verification System (PVS), to assist formal verification of TIC at a high grade of automation. TIC semantics has been constructed by the PVS typed higher-order logic. Based on the encoding, we have checked all TIC reasoning rules and discovered subtle flaws. A translator has been implemented in Java to automatically transform TIC models into PVS specifications. A collection of supplementary rules and PVS strategies has been defined to facilitate the rigorous reasoning of TIC models with functional and non-functional (for example, real-time) requirements at the interval level. Our approach is generic and can be applied further to support other real-time notations.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Chunqing Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chunqing", "Jin Song Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jin_Song", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
