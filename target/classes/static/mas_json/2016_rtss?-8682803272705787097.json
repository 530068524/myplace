Real-time communication among wireless network interfaces and real-time scheduling for complex, dynamic applications have been intensively studied. Despite these major efforts, there is still a significant gap to fill. In particular, the integration of several real-time components to provide end-to-end real-time guarantees between interfaces of distributed applications in wireless CPS is an unsolved problem. We thus present a distributed protocol that considers the complete transmission chain including peripheral busses, memory accesses, networking interfaces, and the wireless real-time protocol. Our protocol provably guarantees that message buffers along this chain do not overflow and that all messages received at the destination application interface meet their end-to-end deadlines. To achieve this while being adaptive to unpredictable changes in the system and the real-time traffic requirements, our protocol establishes at run-time a set of contracts among all major elements of the transmission chain based on a worst-case delay and buffer analysis of the overall system. Using simulations, we validate that our analytic bounds are both safe and tight.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Dresden University of Technology", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Romain Jacob.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacob:Romain", "Marco Zimmerling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmerling:Marco", "Pengcheng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Pengcheng", "Jan Beutel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beutel:Jan", "Lothar Thiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thiele:Lothar"], "pages": 12}
