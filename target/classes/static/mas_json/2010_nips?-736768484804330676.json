The two-layer approach can be easily generalized to deeper structures in a hierarchical multiple-layer manner. Empirically, it is shown that the deep coding approach yields improved performance in benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "NEC Laboratorie ...
