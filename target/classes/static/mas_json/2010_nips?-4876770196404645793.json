We present a framework, reminiscent of structural risk minimization, for empirical risk minimization of the parameters of a fixed probabilistic grammar using the log-loss. We derive sample complexity bounds in this framework that apply both to the supervised setting and the un-supervised setting.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Shay B.
