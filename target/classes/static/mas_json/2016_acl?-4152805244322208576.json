We focus here on \u201clinguistic alignment,\u201d changes in word choice based on others\u2019 choices. Although linguistic alignment is observed across many different contexts and its degree correlates with important social factors such as power and likability, its sources are still uncertain. We build on a recent probabilistic model of alignment, using it to separate out alignment attributable to words versus word categories. We model alignment in two contexts: telephone conversations and microblog replies. Our results show evidence of alignment, but it is primarily lexical rather than categorical. Furthermore, we find that discourse acts modulate alignment substantially. This evidence supports the view that alignment is shaped by strategic communicative processes related to the ongoing discourse.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Gabriel Doyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doyle:Gabriel", "Michael C.
