In conventional research, a single physical quantity has been used to render aerial haptic images. In contrast, our method combines multiple fields (light and acoustic fields) at the same time. While these fields have no direct interference, combining them provides benefits such as multi-resolution haptic images and a synergistic effect on haptic perception. We conducted user studies with laser haptics and ultrasonic haptics separately and tested their superposition. The results showed that the acoustic field affects the tactile perception of the laser haptics. We explored augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications such as providing haptic feedback of the combination of these two methods. We believe that the results of this study contribute to the exploration of laser haptic displays and expand the expression of aerial haptic displays based on other principles.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "Utsunomiya University", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Utsunomiya University", "Utsunomiya University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yoichi Ochiai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ochiai:Yoichi", "Kota Kumagai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumagai:Kota", "Takayuki Hoshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoshi:Takayuki", "Satoshi Hasegawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasegawa:Satoshi", "Yoshio Hayasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayasaki:Yoshio"], "pages": 10}
