{"title": "Why Users Disintermediate Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "peer to peer", "marketing", "personality", "database transaction"], "abstract": "This paper reports on a study of the prevalence of and possible reasons for peer-to-peer transaction marketplace (P2PM) users turning to out-of-market (OOM) transactions after finding transaction partners within a P2P system. We surveyed 97 P2PM users and interviewed 22 of 58 who reported going OOM. We did not find any evidence of predisposing personality factors for OOM activity; instead, it seems to be a rational response to circumstances, with a variety of situationally rational motivations at play, such as liking the transaction partner and trusting that good quality repeat transactions will occur in the future.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "PARC", "PARC", "Google", "PARC"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Victoria Bellotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellotti:Victoria", "Daniel Turner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turner:Daniel", "Kamila Demkova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demkova:Kamila", "Alexander Ambard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ambard:Alexander", "Amanda Waterman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waterman:Amanda"], "pages": 13}
