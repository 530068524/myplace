With the aid of scale space theory, optimization of non-Gaussian, multimodal MRF models using DDMSBP becomes less sensitive to local maxima. This is a significant improvement over standard BP inference, and extends the range of methods that are computationally tractable. In particular, when pair-wise potentials are Gaussians, the time complexity of DDMSBP becomes bilinear in the numbers of states and nodes in the MRF. Experimental results from simulation and non-rigid deformable neuroimage registration demonstrate that our method is faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art inference algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Minwoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Minwoo", "Somesh Kashyap.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kashyap:Somesh", "Robert T.
