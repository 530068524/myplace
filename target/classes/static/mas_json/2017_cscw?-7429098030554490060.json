In this paper, we attempt to explore the possibilities and limitations of using an online document collaboration tool for design problem-solving activities. A design workshop study was conducted to compare using Google Docs during a design task to face-to-face collaboration. As a result, we found different influences of exploiting an online document collaboration tool and face-to-face interaction on the design process, and identified the properties that afford different characteristics of design problem-solving activity. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications of using an online document collaboration tool and face-to-face interaction for collaborative design.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Young-Wook Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Young=Wook", "Youn-Kyung Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Youn=Kyung", "Myungsuk Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Myungsuk"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
