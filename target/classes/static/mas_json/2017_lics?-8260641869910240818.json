We show that within this framework, concepts defined by first-order formulas over a background structure of at most polylogarithmic degree can be learned in polylogarithmic time in the \u201cprobably approximately correct\u201d learning sense.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Martin Grohe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grohe:Martin", "Martin Ritzert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ritzert:Martin"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
