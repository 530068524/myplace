{"title": "Impromptu: a new interaction framework for supporting collaboration in multiple display environments and its field evaluation for co-located software development.", "fields": ["software development", "human computer interaction", "multimedia", "impromptu", "group work"], "abstract": "We present a new interaction framework for collaborating in multiple display environments (MDEs) and report results from a field study investigating its use in an authentic work setting. Our interaction framework, IMPROMPTU, allows users to share task information across displays via off-the-shelf applications, to jointly interact with information for focused problem solving and to place information on shared displays for discussion and reflection. Our framework also includes a lightweight interface for performing these and related actions. A three week field study of our framework was conducted in the domain of face-to-face group software development. Results show that teams utilized almost every feature of the framework in support of a wide range of development-related activities. The framework was used most to facilitate opportunistic collaboration involving task information. Teams reported wanting to continue using the framework as they found value in it overall.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jacob T.
