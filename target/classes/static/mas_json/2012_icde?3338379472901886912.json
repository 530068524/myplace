{"title": "NYAYA: A System Supporting the Uniform Management of Large Sets of Semantic Data.", "fields": ["semantic data model", "conjunctive query", "semantic web", "ontology", "metadata"], "abstract": "We present Nyaya, a flexible system for the management of large-scale semantic data which couples a general-purpose storage mechanism with efficient ontological query answering. Nyaya rapidly imports semantic data expressed in different formalisms into semantic data kiosks. Each kiosk exposes the native ontological constraints in a uniform fashion using data log+-, a very general rule-based language for the representation of ontological constraints. A group of kiosks forms a semantic data market where the data in each kiosk can be uniformly accessed using conjunctive queries and where users can specify user-defined constraints over the data. Nyaya is easily extensible and robust to updates of both data and meta-data in the kiosk and can readily adapt to different logical organizations of the persistent storage. In the demonstration, we will show the capabilities of Nyaya over real-world case studies and demonstrate its efficiency over well-known benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Univ.
