{"title": "Introducing a spatiotemporal tactile variometer to leverage thermal updrafts.", "fields": ["thermal", "clockwise", "variometer", "sensory cue", "embedded system"], "abstract": "Measuring and displaying the vertical velocity of the paraglider is vital to the pilot to extend the flight or to avoid danger. With so-called variometers the vertical velocity is displayed through auditory and visual cues. This paper presents a 6-channel tactile variometer cuff that uses clockwise and counter-clockwise rotating spatiotemporal vibrations to inform the pilot about the current vertical velocity. The system was implemented and evaluated by paraglider pilots in-flight. The pilots were able to extend their flights and use the cuff to stay in thermals using the tactile variometer.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Erik Pescara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pescara:Erik", "Michael Beigl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beigl:Michael", "Jonathan Gr\u00e4ser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=auml=ser:Jonathan"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
