Current practice usually involves numerous tweak-benchmark cycles that are slow and costly. To address this issue, we developed CAPES, a model-less deep reinforcement learning-based unsupervised parameter tuning system driven by a deep neural network (DNN). It is designed to find the optimal values of tunable parameters in computer systems, from a simple client-server system to a large data center, where human tuning can be costly and often cannot achieve optimal performance. CAPES takes periodic measurements of a target computer system's state, and trains a DNN which uses Q-learning to suggest changes to the system's current parameter values. CAPES is minimally intrusive, and can be deployed into a production system to collect training data and suggest tuning actions during the system's daily operation. Evaluation of a prototype on a Lustre file system demonstrates an increase in I/O throughput up to 45% at saturation point.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Yan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yan", "Kenneth Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kenneth", "Oceane Bel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bel:Oceane", "Ethan L.
