To address this problem, some on-line guiding techniques display all available gestures in response to partial input. However, partial input recognition algorithms are scale dependent while most gesture recognizers support scale independence (i.e., the same shape at different scales actually invokes the same command). We propose an algorithm for estimating the scale of any partial input in the context of a gesture recognition system and illustrate how it can be used to improve users' experience with gesture-based systems.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Paris-Sud", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Caroline Appert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Appert:Caroline", "Olivier Bau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bau:Olivier"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
