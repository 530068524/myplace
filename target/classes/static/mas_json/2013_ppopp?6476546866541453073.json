{"title": "Betweenness centrality: algorithms and implementations.", "fields": ["multi core processor", "network theory", "betweenness centrality", "thread", "centrality"], "abstract": "Betweenness centrality is an important metric in the study of social networks, and several algorithms for computing this metric exist in the literature. This paper makes three contributions. First, we show that the problem of computing betweenness centrality can be formulated abstractly in terms of a small set of  operators  that update the graph. Second, we show that existing parallel algorithms for computing betweenness centrality can be viewed as implementations of different schedules for these operators, permitting all these algorithms to be formulated in a single framework. Third, we derive a new asynchronous parallel algorithm for betweenness centrality that (i) works seamlessly for both weighted and unweighted graphs, (ii) can be applied to large graphs, and (iii) is able to extract large amounts of parallelism. We implemented this algorithm and compared it against a number of publicly available implementations of previous algorithms on two different multicore architectures. Our results show that the new algorithm is the best performing one in most cases, particularly for large graphs and large thread counts, and is always competitive against other algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Dimitrios Prountzos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prountzos:Dimitrios", "Keshav Pingali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pingali:Keshav"], "pages": 12}
