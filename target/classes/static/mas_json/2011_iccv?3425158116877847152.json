This framework serves as a perceptual organization stage that integrates information from low-level image cues with that of high-level part detectors. Pixels and parts each appear as nodes in a graph whose edges encode both affinity and ordering relationships. We derive a generalized eigen-problem from this graph and read off an interpretation of the image from the solution eigenvectors. Combining an off-the-shelf top-down part-based person detector with our low-level cues and grouping formulation, we demonstrate improvements to object detection and segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "Boston College", "California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Michael Maire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maire:Michael", "Stella X.
