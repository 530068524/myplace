At the same time it has raised serious concerns about the privacy of user contexts.   In this paper, we present MASKIT, a technique to filter a user context stream that provably preserves privacy. The filtered context stream can be released to applications or be used to answer their queries. Privacy is defined with respect to a set of sensitive contexts specified by the user. MASKIT limits what adversaries can learn from the filtered stream about the user being in a sensitive context - even if the adversaries are powerful and have knowledge about the filtering system and temporal correlations in the context stream.   At the heart of MASKIT is a privacy check deciding whether to release or suppress the current user context. We present two novel privacy checks and explain how to choose the one with the higher utility for a user. Our experiments on real smartphone context traces of 91 users demonstrate the high utility of MASKIT.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Twitter", "Microsoft", "Cornell University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Michaela G\u00f6tz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml=tz:Michaela", "Suman Nath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nath:Suman", "Johannes Gehrke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehrke:Johannes"], "pages": 12}
