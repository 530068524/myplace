Semi-structured SE data cannot be queried in a SQL-like manner because of its lack of structure. Consequently, there are a variety of customized tools built to analyze specific datasets but these do not generalize. We propose to develop a generic framework for exploration and querying of semi-structured SE data. Our approach investigates the use of a formal concept lattice as a universal data structure and a tag cloud as an intuitive interface to support data exploration.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Stellenbosch University"], "authors": ["Gillian J.
