We call this new problem interactive submodular set cover. Applications include advertising in social networks with hidden information. We give an approximation guarantee for a novel greedy algorithm and give a hardness of approximation result which matches up to constant factors. We also discuss negative results for simpler approaches and present encouraging early experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Andrew Guillory.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guillory:Andrew", "Jeff A.
