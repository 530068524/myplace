We show that the weights can be learned in a max-margin framework which directly optimizes the classification performance. The discriminative training takes into account both the codebook appearance and the spatial distribution of its position with respect to the object center to derive its importance. On various datasets we show that the discriminative training improves the Hough detector. Combined with a verification step using a SVM based classifier, our approach achieves a detection rate of 91.9% at 0.3 false positives per image on the ETHZ shape dataset, a significant improvement over the state of the art, while running the verification step on at least an order of magnitude fewer windows than in a sliding window approach.", "citation": "Citations (366)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Subhransu Maji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maji:Subhransu", "Jitendra Malik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malik:Jitendra"], "pages": 8}
