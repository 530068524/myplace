We report on two surveys using Mechanical Turk which looked at senders' (N=402} use of and reactions to the `message seen' feature, and recipients' (N=316) privacy and signaling behaviors in the face of such visibility. Our findings indicate that senders experience a range of emotions when their message is not read, or is read but not answered immediately. Recipients also engage in various signaling behaviors in the face of visibility by both replying or not replying immediately.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oberlin College", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Roberto Hoyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoyle:Roberto", "Srijita Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Srijita", "Apu Kapadia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapadia:Apu", "Adam J.
