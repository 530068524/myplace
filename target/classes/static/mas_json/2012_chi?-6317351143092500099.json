Our work follows a line of crowd-sourced monolingual translation systems, and it is the first attempt to deploy such a system \"in the wild\". The results are promising, but we also found out that simultaneously drawing from multiple crowds with different expertise and sizes poses unique problems in the design of such crowd-sourcing systems.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Chang Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Chang", "Philip Resnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Resnik:Philip", "Yakov Kronrod.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kronrod:Yakov", "Benjamin B.
