The study used several independent data sources: five months of empirical micro-blogging data, user demographic information from corporate HR records, a web based survey, and targeted interviews. The results revealed that users vary in their posting activities, reading behaviors, and perceived benefits. The analysis also identified barriers to adoption, such as the noise-to-value ratio paradoxes. The findings can help both practitioners and scholars build an initial understanding of how knowledge workers are likely to use micro-blogging in the enterprise.", "citation": "Citations (254)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Pitney Bowes", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Pitney Bowes", "Pitney Bowes"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0008:Jun", "Yan Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Yan", "Jane Cody.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cody:Jane", "Yulingling Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yulingling"], "pages": 10}
