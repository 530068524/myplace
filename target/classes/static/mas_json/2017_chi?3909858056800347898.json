Some extensions investigated steering around corners. Yet, little is known about human performance in navigating joined linear paths, i.e., successions of path segments with different widths. Such operations appear in graphical user interface tasks, including lasso operations in illustration software. In this work, we conducted several experiments involving joined paths. The results show that users significantly changed their behavior, and that this strategy change can be predicted beforehand. A simple model summing the two indexes of difficulty ( ID s) for each path predicts movement time well, but more sophisticated models were also evaluated. The best model in terms of both of  R  2  and  AIC  values includes the  ID  of the crossing operation to enter the second path.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Japan Society for the Promotion of Science", "Simon Fraser University", "Meiji University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Shota Yamanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamanaka:Shota", "Wolfgang Stuerzlinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stuerzlinger:Wolfgang", "Homei Miyashita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miyashita:Homei"], "pages": 12}
