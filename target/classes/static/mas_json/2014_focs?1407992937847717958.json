Each iterationof our method consists of solving O(1) linear systems andadditional nearly linear time computation. Our method improves uponthe previous best iteration bounds by factor of a#x03a9;(m/rank(A))1/4 for methods with polynomial time computable iterations and by a#x03a9;((m/rank(A))1/2) for methods which solve at most O(1) linear systems ineach iteration each achieved over 20 years ago.Applying our techniques to the linear program formulation of maximumflow yields an O(|E| a#x221A;(|V|) log2(U)) time algorithm forsolving the maximum flow problem on directed graphs with |E| edges,|V| vertices, and capacity ratio U. This improves upon the previousfastest running time of O(|E| min(|E|(1/2), |V|(2/3)) log(|V|2/|E|) log(U))achieved over 15 years ago by Goldberg and Rao and improves upon theprevious best running times for solving dense directed unit capacitygraphs of O(|E| min(|E|(1/2), |V|(2/3))) achieved by Even and Tarjanover 35 years ago and a running time of O(|E|(10/7)) achievedrecently by Ma#x0105;dry.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yin Tat Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yin_Tat", "Aaron Sidford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sidford:Aaron"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
