However, this method requires that shape surface is not elastic. In other words, it is sensitive to topological transformations such as stretching and compressing. To tackle this problem, we propose a new approach that constructs a high-dimensional space to embed the manifolds of shapes based on sparse representation, which is able to completely withstand rigid transformations and considerably tolerate topological transformations. Experiments on TOSCA shapes validate the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Longwen Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Longwen", "Shuigeng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Shuigeng"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
