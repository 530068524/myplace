At each frame, discrimination of the target from the background is posed as a binary classification problem. From a pool of feature descriptors for the target and background, a subset that is most informative for classification between the two is selected using the principle of maximum marginal diversity. Using these features, the location of the target in the next frame is identified using top-down saliency, completing one iteration of the tracking algorithm. We also show that a simple extension of the framework to include motion features in a bottom-up saliency mode can robustly identify salient moving objects and automatically initialize the tracker. The connections of the proposed method to existing works on discriminant tracking are discussed. Experimental results comparing the proposed method to the state of the art in tracking are presented, showing improved performance.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Vijay Mahadevan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahadevan:Vijay", "Nuno Vasconcelos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasconcelos:Nuno"], "pages": 7}
