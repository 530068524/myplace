Success has been achieved incorporating advice into the  k -means and spectral clustering frameworks. Although the theory community has explored inconsistent advice, it has not yet been incorporated into spectral clustering. Extending work of De Bie and Cristianini, we set out a framework for finding minimum normalised cuts, subject to inconsistent advice.", "citation": "Citations (41)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Tom Coleman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coleman:Tom", "James Saunderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saunderson:James", "Anthony Wirth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wirth:Anthony"], "pages": 8}
