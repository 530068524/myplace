{"title": "The Multiscale Laplacian Graph Kernel.", "fields": ["polynomial kernel", "string kernel", "tree kernel", "kernel embedding of distributions", "graph kernel"], "abstract": "Many real world graphs, such as the graphs of molecules, exhibit structure at multiple different scales, but most existing kernels between graphs are either purely local or purely global in character. In contrast, by building a hierarchy of nested subgraphs, the Multiscale Laplacian Graph kernels (MLG kernels) that we define in this paper can account for structure at a range of different scales. At the heart of the MLG construction is another new graph kernel, called the Feature Space Laplacian Graph kernel (FLG kernel), which has the property that it can lift a base kernel defined on the vertices of two graphs to a kernel between the graphs. The MLG kernel applies such FLG kernels to subgraphs recursively. To make the MLG kernel computationally feasible, we also introduce a randomized projection procedure, similar to the Nystro \u0308m method, but for RKHS operators.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "authors": ["Risi Kondor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kondor:Risi", "Horace Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Horace"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
