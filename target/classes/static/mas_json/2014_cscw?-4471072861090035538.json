Two factors that may have an influence on such interactions are cultural differences between individuals in highly multicultural workplaces, and the layout and physical spaces of the workplace itself. In this work, we investigate how these two factors may facilitate or hinder inter-group interactions in the workplace. We analyze traces collected using wearable electronic badges to capture face-to-face interactions and mobility patterns of employees in a research laboratory in the UK. We observe that those who interact with people of different roles tend to come from collectivist cultures that value relationships and where people tend to be comfortable with social hierarchies, and that some locations in particular are more likely to host serendipitous interactions, knowledge that could be used by organizations to enhance communication and productivity.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "Telef\u00f3nica", "Yahoo!", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Chlo\u00eb Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brown:Chlo=euml=", "Christos Efstratiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efstratiou:Christos", "Ilias Leontiadis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leontiadis:Ilias", "Daniele Quercia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quercia:Daniele", "Cecilia Mascolo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mascolo:Cecilia"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
