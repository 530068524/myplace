Reasoning over time in such dynamic knowledge graphs is not yet well understood. To this end, we present Know-Evolve, a novel deep evolutionary knowledge network that learns non-linearly evolving entity representations over time. The occurrence of a fact (edge) is modeled as a multivariate point process whose intensity function is modulated by the score for that fact computed based on the learned entity embeddings. We demonstrate significantly improved performance over various relational learning approaches on two large scale real-world datasets. Further, our method effectively predicts occurrence or recurrence time of a fact which is novel compared to prior reasoning approaches in multi-relational setting.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Rakshit Trivedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trivedi:Rakshit", "Hanjun Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Hanjun", "Yichen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yichen", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le"], "pages": 10}
