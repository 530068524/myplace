{"title": "Scalable action recognition with a subspace forest.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "subspace topology", "grassmannian", "model selection", "linear subspace"], "abstract": "We present a novel structure, called a Subspace Forest, designed to provide an efficient approximate nearest neighbor query of subspaces represented as points on Grassmann manifolds. We apply this structure to action recognition by representing actions as subspaces spanning a sequence of thumbnail image tiles extracted from a tracked entity. The Subspace Forest lifts the concept of randomized decision forests from classifying vectors to classifying subspaces, and employs a splitting method that respects the underlying manifold geometry. The Subspace Forest is an inherently parallel structure and is highly scalable due to O(log N) recognition time complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracies on the well-known KTH Actions and UCF Sports benchmarks, and a competitive score on Cambridge Gestures. In addition to being both highly accurate and scalable, the Subspace Forest is built without supervision and requires no extensive validation stage for model selection. Conceptually, the Subspace Forest could be used anywhere set-to-set feature matching is desired.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Colorado State University", "Colorado State University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Stephen O'Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Hara:Stephen", "Bruce A.
