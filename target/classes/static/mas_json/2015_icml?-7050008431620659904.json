The detection of DLAs in large-scale spectroscopic surveys such as SDSS-III is critical to address outstanding cosmological questions, such as the nature of galaxy formation. We use nearly 50 000 QSO spectra to learn a tailored Gaussian process model for quasar emission spectra, which we apply to the DLA detection problem via Bayesian model selection. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness with a large-scale validation experiment on over 100 000 spectra, with excellent performance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Roman Garnett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garnett:Roman", "Shirley Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Shirley", "Jeff G.
