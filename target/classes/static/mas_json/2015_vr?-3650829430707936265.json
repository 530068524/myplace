In this paper, a system that will provide robust high-speed tracking without any markers on objects against illumination changes, including projected images, is realized by introducing a retroreflective background with the optical axis controller for Dynamic Projection Mapping. Low-intensity episcopic light is projected with Projection Mapping content, and the light reflected from the background is sufficient for high-speed cameras but is nearly invisible to observers. In addition, we introduce adaptive windows and peripheral weighted erosion to maintain accurate high-speed tracking. Under low light conditions, we examined the visual performance of diffuse reflection and retroreflection from both camera and observer viewpoints. We evaluated stability relative to illumination and disturbance caused by non-target objects. Dynamic Projection Mapping with partially well-lit content in a low-intensity light environment is realized by our proposed system.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Gunma University", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Tomohiro Sueishi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sueishi:Tomohiro", "Hiromasa Oku.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oku:Hiromasa", "Masatoshi Ishikawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishikawa:Masatoshi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
