{"title": "From images to scenes: Compressing an image cluster into a single scene model for place recognition.", "fields": ["image retrieval", "visual word", "cluster analysis", "feature", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "The recognition of a place depicted in an image typically adopts methods from image retrieval in large-scale databases. First, a query image is described as a \u201cbag-of-features\u201d and compared to every image in the database. Second, the most similar images are passed to a geometric verification stage. However, this is an inefficient approach when considering that some database images may be almost identical, and many image features may not repeatedly occur. We address this issue by clustering similar database images to represent distinct scenes, and tracking local features that are consistently detected to form a set of real-world landmarks. Query images are then matched to landmarks rather than features, and a probabilistic model of landmark properties is learned from the cluster to appropriately verify or reject putative feature matches. We present novelties in both a bag-of-features retrieval and geometric verification stage based on this concept. Results on a database of 200K images of popular tourist destinations show improvements in both recognition performance and efficiency compared to traditional image retrieval methods.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Edward Johns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johns:Edward", "Guang-Zhong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Guang=Zhong"], "pages": 8}
