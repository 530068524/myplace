{"title": "The performance of touch screen soft buttons.", "fields": ["stylus", "human computer interaction", "multimedia", "mobile device", "usability"], "abstract": "The introduction of a new generation of attractive touch screen-based devices raises many basic usability questions whose answers may influence future design and market direction. With a set of current mobile devices, we conducted three experiments focusing on one of the most basic interaction actions on touch screens: the operation of soft buttons. Issues investigated in this set of experiments include: a comparison of soft button and hard button performance; the impact of audio and vibrato-tactile feedback; the impact of different types of touch sensors on use, behavior, and performance; a quantitative comparison of finger and stylus operation; and an assessment of the impact of soft button sizes below the traditional 22 mm recommendation as well as below finger width.", "citation": "Citations (239)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "IBM"], "authors": ["Seungyon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Seungyon", "Shumin Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Shumin"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
