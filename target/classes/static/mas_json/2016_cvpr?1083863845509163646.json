Efficiently clustering such data is a challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering method called Discriminatively Embedded K-Means (DEKM), which embeds the synchronous learning of multiple discriminative subspaces into multi-view K-Means clustering to construct a unified framework, and adaptively control the intercoordinations between these subspaces simultaneously. In this framework, we firstly design a weighted multi-view Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and then develop an unsupervised optimization scheme to alternatively learn the common clustering indicator, multiple discriminative subspaces and weights for heterogeneous features with convergence. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets and comparisons with several state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms demonstrate the superiority of the proposed work.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jinglin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jinglin", "Junwei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Junwei", "Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping"], "pages": 9}
