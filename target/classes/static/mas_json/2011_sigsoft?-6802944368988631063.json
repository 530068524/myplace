{"title": "BugCache for inspections: hit or miss?", "fields": ["empirical process", "data mining", "miss", "computer science", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Inspection is a highly effective but costly technique for quality control. Most companies do not have the resources to inspect all the code; thus accurate defect prediction can help focus available inspection resources. BugCache is a simple, elegant, award-winning prediction scheme that \"caches\" files that are likely to contain defects [12]. In this paper, we evaluate the utility of BugCache as a tool for focusing inspection, we examine the assumptions underlying BugCache with the aim of improving it, and finally we compare it with a simple, standard bug-prediction technique. We find that BugCache is, in fact, useful for focusing inspection effort; but surprisingly, we find that its performance, when used for inspections, is not much better than a naive prediction model -- viz., a model that orders files in the system by their count of closed bugs and chooses enough files to capture 20% of the lines in the system.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "conf": "sigsoft", "authors": ["Foyzur Rahman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahman:Foyzur", "Daryl Posnett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Posnett:Daryl", "Abram Hindle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hindle:Abram", "Earl T.
