{"title": "Virtual lightweight snapshots for consistent analytics in NoSQL stores.", "fields": ["snapshot", "bridging", "distributed transaction", "nosql", "analytics"], "abstract": "Increasingly, applications that deal with big data need to run analytics concurrently with updates. But bridging the gap between big and fast data is challenging: most of these applications require analytics' results that are fresh and consistent, but without impacting system latency and throughput. We propose virtual lightweight snapshots (VLS), a mechanism that enables consistent analytics without blocking incoming updates in NoSQL stores. VLS requires neither native support for database versioning nor a transaction manager. Besides, it is storage-efficient, keeping additional versions of records only when needed to guarantee consistency, and sharing versions across multiple concurrent snapshots. We describe an implementation of VLS in MongoDB and present a detailed experimental evaluation which shows that it supports consistency for analytics with small impact on query evaluation time, update throughput, and latency.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["New York University", "IBM", "IBM", "New York University"], "authors": ["Fernando Chirigati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chirigati:Fernando", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Sim\u00e9on.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim=eacute=on:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Martin Hirzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirzel:Martin", "Juliana Freire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freire:Juliana"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
