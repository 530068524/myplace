We consider a pattern-based mining approach that uses a pattern library to generate and check potential properties over given traces, and then combines successful patterns. By using predefined models to measure the tool's precision and recall we demonstrate that our approach can effectively and efficiently extract specifications in realistic scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "University of Manchester"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Giles Reger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reger:Giles", "Howard Barringer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barringer:Howard", "David E.
