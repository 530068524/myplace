Recent work has applied causal inference to eliminate or reduce control and data flow dependence confounding bias in statement-level statistical debuggers. The result is improved effectiveness. This is encouraging but motivates two novel questions: (1) how can causal inference be applied in predicate-level statistical debuggers and (2) what other biases can be eliminated or reduced. Here we address both questions by providing a model that eliminates or reduces control flow dependence and failure flow confounding bias within predicate-level statistical debuggers. We present empirical results demonstrating that our model significantly improves the effectiveness of a variety of predicate-level statistical debuggers, including those that eliminate or reduce only a single source of confounding bias.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Ross Gore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gore:Ross", "Paul F.
