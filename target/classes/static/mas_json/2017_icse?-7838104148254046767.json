{"title": "Supporting software developers with a holistic recommender system.", "fields": ["software development", "recommender system", "software", "chart", "context analysis"], "abstract": "The promise of recommender systems is to provide intelligent support to developers during their programming tasks. Such support ranges from suggesting program entities to taking into account pertinent Q&A pages. However, current recommender systems limit the context analysis to change history and developers' activities in the IDE, without considering what a developer has already consulted or perused,  e.g. , by performing searches from the Web browser. Given the faceted nature of many programming tasks, and the incompleteness of the information provided by a single artifact, several heterogeneous resources are required to obtain the broader picture needed by a developer to accomplish a task.   We present Libra, a  holistic  recommender system. It supports the process of searching and navigating the information needed by constructing a  holistic  meta-information model of the resources perused by a developer, analyzing their semantic relationships, and augmenting the web browser with a dedicated interactive navigation chart. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Libra provides evidence that a  holistic  analysis of a developer's information context can indeed offer comprehensive and contextualized support to information navigation and retrieval during software development.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Molise", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "University of Molise"], "authors": ["Luca Ponzanelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponzanelli:Luca", "Simone Scalabrino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scalabrino:Simone", "Gabriele Bavota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bavota:Gabriele", "Andrea Mocci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mocci:Andrea", "Rocco Oliveto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveto:Rocco", "Massimiliano Di Penta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Penta:Massimiliano_Di", "Michele Lanza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lanza:Michele"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
