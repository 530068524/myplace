Signal Temporal Logic (STL) emerges as a convenient and powerful formalism for continuous and hybrid systems. This paper presents an efficient algorithm for computing the robustness degree in which a piecewise-continuous signal satisfies or violates an STL formula. The algorithm, by leveraging state-of-the-art streaming algorithms from Signal Processing, is linear in the size of the signal and its implementation in the Breach tool is shown to outperform alternative implementations.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Grenoble", "University of Grenoble"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Alexandre Donz\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Donz=eacute=:Alexandre", "Thomas Ferr\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferr=egrave=re:Thomas", "Oded Maler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maler:Oded"], "pages": 16}
