{"title": "Euphrates: Algorithm-SoC Co-Design for Low-Power Mobile Continuous Vision.", "fields": ["digital signal processor", "hardware acceleration", "application specific integrated circuit", "convolutional neural network", "mobile device"], "abstract": "Continuous computer vision (CV) tasks increasingly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, CNNs have massive compute demands that far exceed the performance and energy constraints of mobile devices. In this paper, we propose and develop an algorithm-architecture co-designed system, Euphrates, that simultaneously improves the energy-efficiency and performance of continuous vision tasks.   Our key observation is that changes in pixel data between consecutive frames represents visual motion. We first propose an algorithm that leverages this motion information to relax the number of expensive CNN inferences required by continuous vision applications. We co-design a mobile System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architecture to maximize the efficiency of the new algorithm. The key to our architectural augmentation is to  co-optimize different SoC IP blocks in the vision pipeline collectively.  Specifically, we propose to expose the motion data that is naturally generated by the Image Signal Processor (ISP) early in the vision pipeline to the CNN engine. Measurement and synthesis results show that Euphrates achieves up to 66% SoC-level energy savings (4x for the vision computations), with only 1% accuracy loss.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "ARM Research", "ARM Research"], "authors": ["Yuhao Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yuhao", "Anand Samajdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samajdar:Anand", "Matthew Mattina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mattina:Matthew", "Paul N.
