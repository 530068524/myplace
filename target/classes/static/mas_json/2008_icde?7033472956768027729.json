{"title": "Transformation-based Framework for Record Matching.", "fields": ["standardization", "synonym", "string", "transformational leadership", "data warehouse"], "abstract": "Today's record matching infrastructure does not allow a flexible way to account for synonyms such as \"Robert\" and \"Bob\" which refer to the same name, and more general forms of string transformations such as abbreviations. We propose a programmatic framework of record matching that takes such user-defined string transformations as input. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal for such a framework. This transformational framework, while expressive, poses significant computational challenges which we address. We empirically evaluate our techniques over real data.", "citation": "Citations (148)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Arvind Arasu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arasu:Arvind", "Surajit Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Surajit", "Raghav Kaushik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaushik:Raghav"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
