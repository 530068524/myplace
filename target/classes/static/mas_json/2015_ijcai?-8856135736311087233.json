In this paper, we show that for every fixed e > 0, every bimatrix game (with values in [0; 1]) has an e-approximate Nash equilibrium with the total payoff of the players at least a constant factor, (1 - \u221a1 - e)2, of the optimum. Furthermore, our result can be made algorithmic in the following sense: for every fixed 0 \u2264 e* < e, if we can find an e*-approximate Nash equilibrium in polynomial time, then we can find in polynomial time an e-approximate Nash equilibrium with the total payoff of the players at least a constant factor of the optimum.\n\nOur analysis is especially tight in the case when e \u2265 1/2. In this case, we show that for any bimatrix game there is an e-approximate Nash equilibrium with constant size support whose social welfare is at least 2\u221ae - e \u2265 0:914 times the optimal social welfare. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our bound for the social welfare is tight, that is, for every e \u2265 1/2 there is a bimatrix game for which every e-approximate Nash equilibrium has social welfare at most 2\u221ae - e times the optimal social welfare.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "University of Warwick", "University of Warwick"], "authors": ["Artur Czumaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czumaj:Artur", "Michail Fasoulakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fasoulakis:Michail", "Marcin Jurdzinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jurdzinski:Marcin"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
