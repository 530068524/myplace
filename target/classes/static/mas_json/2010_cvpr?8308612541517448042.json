We derive two cues that relate 3D distances to changes in pixel intensity due to clouds shadows. The first cue is primarily spatial, works with low frame-rate time lapses, and supports estimating focal length and scene structure, up to a scale ambiguity. The second cue depends on cloud motion and has a more complex, but still linear, ambiguity. We describe a method that uses the spatial cue to estimate a depth map and a method that combines both cues. Results on time lapses of several outdoor scenes show that these cues enable estimating scene geometry and camera focal length.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Nathan Jacobs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobs:Nathan", "Brian Bies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bies:Brian", "Robert Pless.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pless:Robert"], "pages": 8}
