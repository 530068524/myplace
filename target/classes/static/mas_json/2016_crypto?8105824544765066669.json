{"title": "XPX: Generalized Tweakable Even-Mansour with Improved Security Guarantees.", "fields": ["distributed computing", "pseudorandom permutation", "computer science", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "permutation"], "abstract": "We present $$\\mathrm {XPX}$$, a tweakable blockcipher based on a single permutation $$P$$. On input of a tweak $$t_{11},t_{12},t_{21},t_{22}\\in \\mathcal {T}$$ and a message m, it outputs ciphertext $$c=Pm\\oplus \\varDelta _1\\oplus \\varDelta _2$$, where $$\\varDelta _1=t_{11}k\\oplus t_{12}Pk$$ and $$\\varDelta _2=t_{21}k\\oplus t_{22}Pk$$. Here, the tweak space $$\\mathcal {T}$$ is required to satisfy a certain set of trivial conditions such as $$0,0,0,0\\not \\in \\mathcal {T}$$. We prove that $$\\mathrm {XPX}$$ with any such tweak space is a strong tweakable pseudorandom permutation. Next, we consider the security of $$\\mathrm {XPX}$$ under related-key attacks, where the adversary can freely select a key-deriving function upon every evaluation. We prove that $$\\mathrm {XPX}$$ achieves various levels of related-key security, depending on the set of key-deriving functions and the properties of $$\\mathcal {T}$$. For instance, if $$t_{12}, t_{22}\\ne 0$$ and $$t_{21}, t_{22}\\ne 0,1$$ for all tweaks, $$\\mathrm {XPX}$$ is XOR-related-key secure. $$\\mathrm {XPX}$$ generalizes Even-Mansour $$\\mathrm {EM}$$, but also Rogaway's $$\\mathrm {XEX}$$ based on $$\\mathrm {EM}$$, and various other tweakable blockciphers. As such, $$\\mathrm {XPX}$$ finds a wide range of applications. We show how our results on $$\\mathrm {XPX}$$ directly imply related-key security of the authenticated encryption schemes PrOst-$$\\mathrm {COPA}$$ and $$\\mathrm {Minalpher}$$, and how a straightforward adjustment to the MAC function $$\\mathrm {Chaskey}$$ and to keyed Sponges makes them provably related-key secure.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Bart Mennink.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mennink:Bart"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2016", "pages": 31}
