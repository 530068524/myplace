This paper introduces Randomized Admission Policy (RAP) \u2014 a novel algorithm for the frequency and top-k estimation problems, which are fundamental in network monitoring. We demonstrate space reductions compared to the alternatives by a factor of up to 32 on real packet traces and up to 128 on heavy-tailed workloads. For top-k identification, RAP exhibits memory savings by a factor of between 4 and 64 depending on the workloads' skewness. These empirical results are backed by formal analysis, indicating the asymptotic space improvement of our probabilistic admission approach. Additionally, we present d-Way RAP, a hardware friendly variant of RAP that empirically maintains its space and accuracy benefits.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Bell Labs", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ran Ben-Basat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Basat:Ran", "Gil Einziger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Einziger:Gil", "Roy Friedman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedman:Roy", "Yaron Kassner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kassner:Yaron"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
