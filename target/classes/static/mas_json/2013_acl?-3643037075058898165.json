{"title": "Leveraging Synthetic Discourse Data via Multi-task Learning for Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition.", "fields": ["training set", "economic shortage", "discourse relation", "labeled data", "multi task learning"], "abstract": "To overcome the shortage of labeled data for implicit discourse relation recognition, previous works attempted to automatically generate training data by removing explicit discourse connectives from sentences and then built models on these synthetic implicit examples. However, a previous study (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) showed that models trained on these synthetic data do not generalize very well to natural (i.e. genuine) implicit discourse data. In this work we revisit this issue and present a multi-task learning based system which can effectively use synthetic data for implicit discourse relation recognition. Results on PDTB data show that under the multi-task learning framework our models with the use of the prediction of explicit discourse connectives as auxiliary learning tasks, can achieve an averaged F1 improvement of 5.86% over baseline models.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "Baidu"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Man Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Man", "Yu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yu", "Zheng-Yu Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Zheng=Yu"], "pages": 10}
