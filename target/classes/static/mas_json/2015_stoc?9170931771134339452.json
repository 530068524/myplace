{"title": "Time Lower Bounds for Nonadaptive Turnstile Streaming Algorithms.", "fields": ["turnstile", "entropy estimation", "streaming algorithm", "cell probe model", "promise problem"], "abstract": "We say a turnstile streaming algorithm is {\\em non-adaptive} if, during updates, the memory cells written and read depend only on the index being updated and random coins tossed at the beginning of the stream (and not on the memory contents of the algorithm). Memory cells read during  queries  may be decided upon adaptively. All known turnstile streaming algorithms in the literature, except a single recent example for a particular  promise problem  [7], are non-adaptive. In fact, even more specifically, they are all linear sketches. We prove the first non-trivial update time lower bounds for both randomized and deterministic turnstile streaming algorithms, which hold when the algorithms are non-adaptive. While there has been abundant success in proving space lower bounds, there have been no non-trivial turnstile update time lower bounds. Our lower bounds hold against classically studied problems such as heavy hitters, point query, entropy estimation, and moment estimation. In some cases of deterministic algorithms, our lower bounds nearly match known upper bounds.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Harvard University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Kasper Green Larsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsen:Kasper_Green", "Jelani Nelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nelson:Jelani", "Huy L.
