{"title": "Flatten and conquer: a framework for efficient analysis of string constraints.", "fields": ["automata theory", "abstraction", "string", "generality", "formal verification"], "abstract": "We describe a uniform and efficient framework for checking the satisfiability of a large class of string constraints. The framework is based on the observation that both satisfiability and unsatisfiability of common constraints can be demonstrated through witnesses with simple patterns. These patterns are captured using  flat  automata each of which consists of a sequence of simple loops. We build a Counter-Example Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) framework which contains both an under- and an over-approximation module. The flow of information between the modules allows to increase the precision in an automatic manner. We have implemented the framework as a tool and performed extensive experimentation that demonstrates both the generality and efficiency of our method.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Uppsala University", "Academia Sinica", "Uppsala University", "Brno University of Technology"], "authors": ["Parosh Aziz Abdulla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdulla:Parosh_Aziz", "Mohamed Faouzi Atig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atig:Mohamed_Faouzi", "Yu-Fang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yu=Fang", "Bui Phi Diep.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diep:Bui_Phi", "Luk\u00e1s Hol\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hol=iacute=k:Luk=aacute=s", "Ahmed Rezine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rezine:Ahmed", "Philipp R\u00fcmmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=uuml=mmer:Philipp"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2017", "pages": 16}
