At the heart of our new annotation model lies a novel latent variable regression approach to capture correlations between image or video features and annotation texts. Instead of sharing a set of latent topics between the 2 data modalities as in the formulation of correspondence LDA in [2], our approach introduces a regression module to correlate the 2 sets of topics, which captures more general forms of association and allows the number of topics in the 2 data modalities to be different. We demonstrate the power of tr-mmLDA on 2 standard annotation datasets: a 5000-image subset of COREL and a 2687-image LabelMe dataset. The proposed association model shows improved performance over correspondence LDA as measured by caption perplexity.", "citation": "Citations (188)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Francisco", "Golden Metallic ... cisco, CA 91147"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Duangmanee Putthividhya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Putthividhya:Duangmanee", "Hagai Thomas Attias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Attias:Hagai_Thomas", "Srikantan S.
