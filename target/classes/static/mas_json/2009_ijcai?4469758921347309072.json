Random games can be used to score positions and evaluate their interest. Random games can also be improved using random games to choose a move to try at each step of a game. Nested Monte-Carlo Search addresses the problem of guiding the search toward better states when there is no available heuristic. It uses nested levels of random games in order to guide the search. The algorithm is studied theoretically on simple abstract problems and applied successfully to three different games: Morpion Solitaire, SameGame and 16\u00d716 Sudoku.", "citation": "Citations (158)", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University"], "authors": ["Tristan Cazenave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cazenave:Tristan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
