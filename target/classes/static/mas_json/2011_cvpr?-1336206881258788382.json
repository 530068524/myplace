{"title": "Locality-sensitive support vector machine by exploring local correlation and global regularization.", "fields": ["overfitting", "locality sensitive hashing", "hash function", "phenomenon", "contextual image classification"], "abstract": "Local classifiers have obtained great success in classification task due to its powerful discriminating ability on local regions. However, most of them still have restricted generalization in twofold: (1) each local classifier is sensitive to noise in local regions which leads to overfitting phenomenon in local classifiers; (2) the local classifiers also ignore the local correlation determined by the sample distribution in each local region. To overcome the above two problems, we present a novel locality-sensitive support vector machine (LSSVM) in this paper for image retrieval problem. This classifier applies locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to divide the whole feature space into a number of local regions, on each of them a local model can be better constructed due to smaller within-class variation on it. To avoid these local models from overfitting into locality-sensitive structures, it imposes a global regularizer across local regions so that local classifiers are smoothly glued together to form a regularized overall classifier. local correlation is modeled to capture the sample distribution that determines the locality structure of each local region, which can increase the discriminating ability of the algorithm. To evaluate the performance, we apply the proposed algorithm into image retrieval task and competitive results are obtained on the real-world web image data set.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Texas at San Antonio", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Guojun Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Guojun", "Qi Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Qi", "Thomas S.
