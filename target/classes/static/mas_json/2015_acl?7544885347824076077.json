We present a simple deep neural network that competes with and, in some cases, outperforms such models on sentiment analysis and factoid question answering tasks while taking only a fraction of the training time. While our model is syntactically-ignorant, we show significant improvements over previous bag-of-words models by deepening our network and applying a novel variant of dropout. Moreover, our model performs better than syntactic models on datasets with high syntactic variance. We show that our model makes similar errors to syntactically-aware models, indicating that for the tasks we consider, nonlinearly transforming the input is more important than tailoring a network to incorporate word order and syntax.", "citation": "Citations (213)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mohit Iyyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iyyer:Mohit", "Varun Manjunatha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manjunatha:Varun", "Jordan L.
