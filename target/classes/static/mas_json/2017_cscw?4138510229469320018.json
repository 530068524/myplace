{"title": "Constructing a Desiring User: Discourse, Rurality, and Design in Location-Based Social Networks.", "fields": ["rurality", "social computing", "computer supported cooperative work", "discourse analysis", "queer"], "abstract": "A growing body of literature addresses the use of Grindr and SCRUFF, location-based networking applications for gay, bisexual, and queer men. This study builds on that work, asking whose sexuality is produced in the design and use of these applications. Drawing from ethnographic research and discourse analysis, we build on analytical frames from science and technology studies, feminist HCI, and sexuality studies, proposing what we call the desiring user: a user whose desires and sexuality are mediated through technological devices in particular ways. In doing so, we demonstrate how the discursive constructions of the user put forth by the creators of Grindr and SCRUFF clash with the lived reality of our rural interlocutors. We address emerging themes in CSCW and HCI related to the construction of sexual subjectivities and social computing in rural settings.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Jean Hardy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardy:Jean", "Silvia Lindtner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindtner:Silvia"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
