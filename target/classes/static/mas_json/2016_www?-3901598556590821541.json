{"title": "From Diversity-based Prediction to Better Ontology & Schema Matching.", "fields": ["cross entropy", "precision and recall", "3 dimensional matching", "schema matching", "ontology alignment"], "abstract": "Ontology & schema matching predictors assess the quality of matchers in the absence of an exact match. We propose MCD (Match Competitor Deviation), a new diversity-based predictor that compares the strength of a matcher confidence in the correspondence of a concept pair with respect to other correspondences that involve either concept. We also propose to use MCD as a regulator to optimally control a balance between Precision and Recall and use it towards 1:1 matching by combining it with a similarity measure that is based on solving a maximum weight bipartite graph matching (MWBM). Optimizing the combined measure is known to be an NP-Hard problem. Therefore, we propose CEM, an approximation to an optimal match by efficiently scanning multiple possible matches, using rare event estimation. Using a thorough empirical study over several benchmark real-world datasets, we show that MCD outperforms other state-of-the-art predictor and that CEM significantly outperform existing matchers.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "IBM", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Avigdor Gal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gal:Avigdor", "Haggai Roitman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roitman:Haggai", "Tomer Sagi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sagi:Tomer"], "conf": "www", "year": "2016", "pages": 11}
