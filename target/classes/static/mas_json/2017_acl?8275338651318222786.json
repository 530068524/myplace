{"title": "Learning Symmetric Collaborative Dialogue Agents with Dynamic Knowledge Graph Embeddings.", "fields": ["graph", "machine learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We study a symmetric collaborative dialogue setting in which two agents, each with private knowledge, must strategically communicate to achieve a common goal. The open-ended dialogue state in this setting poses new challenges for existing dialogue systems. We collected a dataset of 11K human-human dialogues, which exhibits interesting lexical, semantic, and strategic elements. To model both structured knowledge and unstructured language, we propose a neural model with dynamic knowledge graph embeddings that evolve as the dialogue progresses. Automatic and human evaluations show that our model is both more effective at achieving the goal and more human-like than baseline neural and rule-based models.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["He He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:He", "Anusha Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Anusha", "Mihail Eric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eric:Mihail", "Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy"], "pages": 11}
