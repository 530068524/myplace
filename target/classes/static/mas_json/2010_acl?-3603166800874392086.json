A simple and efficient inference method recursively induces joint semantic representations for each group and discovers correspondence between lexical entries and latent semantic concepts. We consider the generative semantics-text correspondence model (Liang et al., 2009) and demonstrate that exploiting the noncontradiction relation between texts leads to substantial improvements over natural baselines on a problem of analyzing human-written weather forecasts.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ivan Titov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Titov:Ivan", "Mikhail Kozhevnikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozhevnikov:Mikhail"], "pages": 10}
