We cast video segmentation as a spatio-temporal superpixel labeling problem. Benefited from the bounding volume provided by off-the-shelf object trackers, we estimate the foreground/ background super-pixel labeling using the spatiotemporal multiple instance learning algorithm to obtain coarse foreground/background separation within the volume. We further refine the segmentation mask in the pixel level using the graph-cut model. Extensive experiments on benchmark video datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed video segmentation algorithm.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Rui Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Rui", "Bingbing Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Bingbing", "Chao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma_0004:Chao", "Yi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yi", "Xiaokang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiaokang"], "pages": 10}
