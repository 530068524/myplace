{"title": "Unifying on-chip and inter-node switching within the Anton 2 network.", "fields": ["static routing", "deadlock", "routing domain", "massively parallel", "hop"], "abstract": "The design of network architectures has become increasingly complex as the chips connected by inter-node networkshave emerged as distributed systems in their own right, complete with their own on-chip networks. In Anton 2, a massively parallel special-purpose supercomputer for molecular dynamics simulations, we managed this complexity by reusing the on-chip network as a switch for inter-node traffic. This unified network approach introduces several design challenges. Maintaining fairness within the inter-node network is difficult, as each hop becomes a sequence of many on-chip routing decisions. We addressed this problem with an inverse-weighted arbiter that ensures fairness with low implementation costs. Balancing the load of inter-node traffic across the on-chip network is also critical, and we adopted an optimization approach to design an appropriate routing algorithm. Finally, the on-chip routers carry inter-node traffic, so they must implement inter-node virtual channels to avoid deadlock. In order to keep the routers small and fast, we developed a deadlock-free routing algorithm that reduces the number of virtual channels by one-third relative to previous approaches. The resulting Anton 2 network implementation efficiently utilizes its inter-node channels and provides low messaging latency, while occupying a modest amount of silicon area", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["D.
