Our approach, we call mapping by demonstration, aims at learning the mapping from examples provided by users while interacting with the system. We propose a general framework for modeling gesture--sound sequences based on a probabilistic, multimodal and hierarchical model. Two orthogonal modeling aspects are detailed and we describe planned research directions to improve and evaluate the proposed models.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University"], "authors": ["Jules Fran\u00e7oise.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fran=ccedil=oise:Jules"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
