{"title": "A tale of two cities: how WebView induces bugs to Android applications.", "fields": ["world wide web", "android", "graphical user interface testing", "machine code", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "WebView is a widely used Android component that augments a native app with web browser capabilities. It eases the interactions between an app\u2019s native code and web code. However, the interaction mechanism of WebView induces new types of bugs in Android apps. Understanding the characteristics and manifestation of these WebView-induced bugs (\u03c9Bugs for short) facilitates the correct usages of WebViews in Android apps. This motivates us to conduct the first empirical study on \u03c9Bugs based on those found in popular open-source Android apps. Our study identified the major root causes and consequences of \u03c9Bugs and made interesting observations that can be leveraged for detecting and diagnosing \u03c9Bugs. Based on the empirical study, we further propose an automated testing technique \u03c9Droid to effectively expose \u03c9Bugs in Android apps. In our experiments, \u03c9Droid successfully discovered 30 unique and previously-unknown \u03c9Bugs when applied to 146 open-source Android apps. We reported the 30 \u03c9Bugs to the corresponding app developers. Out of these 30 \u03c9Bugs, 14 were confirmed and 7 of them were fixed. This shows that \u03c9Droid can effectively detect \u03c9Bugs that are of the developers\u2019 concern.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "University of Science and Technology, Sana'a", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Jiajun Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Jiajun", "Lili Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Lili", "Yepang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yepang", "Shing-Chi Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Shing=Chi", "Huaxun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Huaxun"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 12}
