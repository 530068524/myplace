Successful results on astronomical imaging through atmospheric turbulences and on noisy magnetic resonance images of constantly moving objects demonstrate the practical significance of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (178)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["MPI for Biologi ... bingen, Germany", "MPI for Biologi ... bingen, Germany", "MPI for Biologi ... bingen, Germany", "MPI for Biologi ... bingen, Germany"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michael Hirsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirsch_0001:Michael", "Suvrit Sra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sra:Suvrit", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard", "Stefan Harmeling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harmeling:Stefan"], "pages": 8}
