We show that both Rosati's semantics based on NM-models and Lukasiewicz's answer set semantics can be characterized by circumscription, and the difference between the two can be seen as a matter of circumscription policies. This approach leads to a number of new insights. First, we rebut a criticism on Lukasiewicz's semantics for its inability to reason for negative consequences. Second, our approach leads to a spectrum of possible semantics based on different circumscription policies, and shows a clear picture of how they are related. Finally, we show that the idea of this paper can be applied to first-order general stable models.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Tianjin University", "University of Alberta", "Tianjin University"], "authors": ["Qian Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Qian", "Jia-Huai You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Jia=Huai", "Zhiyong Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Zhiyong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
