{"title": "FAWN: a fast array of wimpy nodes.", "fields": ["orders of magnitude", "consistent hashing", "flash memory", "data access", "computer cluster", "massively parallel"], "abstract": "This paper presents a new cluster architecture for low-power data-intensive computing. FAWN couples low-power embedded CPUs to small amounts of local flash storage, and balances computation and I/O capabilities to enable efficient, massively parallel access to data.   The key contributions of this paper are the principles of the FAWN architecture and the design and implementation of FAWN-KV--a consistent, replicated, highly available, and high-performance key-value storage system built on a FAWN prototype. Our design centers around purely log-structured datastores that provide the basis for high performance on flash storage, as well as for replication and consistency obtained using chain replication on a consistent hashing ring. Our evaluation demonstrates that FAWN clusters can handle roughly 350 key-value queries per Joule of energy--two orders of magnitude more than a disk-based system.", "citation": "Citations (608)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Intel", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Intel", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["David G.
