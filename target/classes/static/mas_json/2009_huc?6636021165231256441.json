Despite the attention paid to this area, few researchers have specifically explored these issues within a community that makes up approximately 30% of U.S. households -- those below the federal poverty line. We present a study of 26 low-income households in two very different locations -- a small town in the Southern U.S. and a northerly metropolitan area. Through a photo-elicitation study and directed interviews, we explore the relationship between energy saving behaviors, external factors, and users' intrinsic values and beliefs. Most of our participants are committed to saving energy for non-financial reasons, even when not responsible for paying bills. Challenges to saving energy include safety and lack of control over the environment. We discuss how Ubicomp technologies for saving energy can address some of these challenges.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Tawanna Dillahunt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillahunt:Tawanna", "Jennifer Mankoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mankoff:Jennifer", "Eric Paulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paulos:Eric", "Susan R.
