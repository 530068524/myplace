{"title": "A Theory of Meta-Diagnosis: Reasoning about Diagnostic Systems.", "fields": ["medical diagnosis", "model based reasoning", "opportunistic reasoning", "psychology of reasoning", "reasoning system"], "abstract": "In Model-Based Diagnosis, a diagnostic algorithm is typically used to compute diagnoses using a model of a real-world system and some observations. Contrary to classical hypothesis, in real-world applications it is sometimes the case that either the model, the observations or the diagnostic algorithm are abnormal with respect to some required properties; with possibly huge economical consequences. Determining which abnormalities exist constitutes a meta-diagnostic problem. We contribute, first, with a general theory of meta-diagnosis with clear semantics to handle this problem. Second, we propose a series of typically required properties and relate them between themselves. Finally, using our meta-diagnostic framework and the studied properties and relations, we model and solve some common meta-diagnostic problems.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Nuno Belard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belard:Nuno", "Yannick Pencol\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pencol=eacute=:Yannick", "Michel Combacau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Combacau:Michel"], "pages": 7}
