It uses a first order low-pass filter with an adaptive cutoff frequency: at low speeds, a low cutoff stabilizes the signal by reducing jitter, but as speed increases, the cutoff is increased to reduce lag. The algorithm is easy to implement, uses very few resources, and with two easily understood parameters, it is easy to tune. In a comparison with other filters, the 1 \u20ac filter has less lag using a reference amount of jitter reduction.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "departments": ["university of lille", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["G\u00e9ry Casiez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casiez:G=eacute=ry", "Nicolas Roussel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roussel:Nicolas", "Daniel Vogel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogel_0001:Daniel"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
