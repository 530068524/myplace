{"title": "Exploiting Syntactico-Semantic Structures for Relation Extraction.", "fields": ["computer science", "existential quantification", "artificial intelligence", "relationship extraction", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In this paper, we observe that there exists a second dimension to the relation extraction (RE) problem that is orthogonal to the relation type dimension. We show that most of these second dimensional structures are relatively constrained and not difficult to identify. We propose a novel algorithmic approach to RE that starts by first identifying these structures and then, within these, identifying the semantic type of the relation. In the real RE problem where relation arguments need to be identified, exploiting these structures also allows reducing pipelined propagated errors. We show that this RE framework provides significant improvement in RE performance.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yee Seng Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Yee_Seng", "Dan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Dan"], "pages": 10}
