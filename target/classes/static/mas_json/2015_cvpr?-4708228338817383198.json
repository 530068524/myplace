In this paper, we propose a novel object representation, 3D Voxel Pattern (3DVP), that jointly encodes the key properties of objects including appearance, 3D shape, viewpoint, occlusion and truncation. We discover 3DVPs in a data-driven way, and train a bank of specialized detectors for a dictionary of 3DVPs. The 3DVP detectors are capable of detecting objects with specific visibility patterns and transferring the meta-data from the 3DVPs to the detected objects, such as 2D segmentation mask, 3D pose as well as occlusion or truncation boundaries. The transferred meta-data allows us to infer the occlusion relationship among objects, which in turn provides improved object recognition results. Experiments are conducted on the KITTI detection benchmark [17] and the outdoor-scene dataset [41]. We improve state-of-the-art results on car detection and pose estimation with notable margins (6% in difficult data of KITTI). We also verify the ability of our method in accurately segmenting objects from the background and localizing them in 3D.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "NEC Laboratorie ... rica, Inc., USA", "NEC Laboratorie ... rica, Inc., USA"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yu Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Yu", "Wongun Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Wongun", "Yuanqing Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Yuanqing", "Silvio Savarese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savarese:Silvio"], "pages": 9}
