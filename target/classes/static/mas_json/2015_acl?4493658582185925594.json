This study focuses on the prediction of the occupational class for a public user profile. Our analysis is conducted on a new annotated corpus of Twitter users, their respective job titles, posted textual content and platform-related attributes. We frame our task as classification using latent feature representations such as word clusters and embeddings. The employed linear and, especially, non-linear methods can predict a user\u2019s occupational class with strong accuracy for the coarsest level of a standard occupation taxonomy which includes nine classes. Combined with a qualitative assessment, the derived results confirm the feasibility of our approach in inferring a new user attribute that can be embedded in a multitude of downstream applications.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Preotiuc=Pietro:Daniel", "Vasileios Lampos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampos:Vasileios", "Nikolaos Aletras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aletras:Nikolaos"], "pages": 11}
