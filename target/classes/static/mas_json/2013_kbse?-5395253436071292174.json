{"title": "Leveraging program equivalence for adaptive program repair: Models and first results.", "fields": ["search based software engineering", "mutation testing", "data flow analysis", "software bug", "quotient space"], "abstract": "Software bugs remain a compelling problem. Automated program repair is a promising approach for reducing cost, and many methods have recently demonstrated positive results. However, success on any particular bug is variable, as is the cost to find a repair. This paper focuses on generate-and-validate repair methods that enumerate candidate repairs and use test cases to define correct behavior. We formalize repair cost in terms of test executions, which dominate most test-based repair algorithms. Insights from this model lead to a novel deterministic repair algorithm that computes a patch quotient space with respect to an approximate semantic equivalence relation. This allows syntactic and dataflow analysis techniques to dramatically reduce the repair search space. Generate-and-validate program repair is shown to be a dual of mutation testing, suggesting several possible cross-fertilizations. Evaluating on 105 real-world bugs in programs totaling 5MLOC and involving 10,000 tests, our new algorithm requires an order-of-magnitude fewer test evaluations than the previous state-of-the-art and is over three times more efficient monetarily.", "citation": "Citations (133)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "University of New Mexico"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Westley Weimer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weimer:Westley", "Zachary P.
