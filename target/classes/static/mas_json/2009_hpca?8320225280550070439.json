{"title": "Feedback mechanisms for improving probabilistic memory prefetching.", "fields": ["instruction prefetch", "exploit", "cache", "locality", "memory architecture"], "abstract": "This paper presents three techniques for improving the effectiveness of the recently proposed Adaptive Stream Detection (ASD) prefetching mechanism. The ASD prefetcher is a standard stream buffer that takes a probabilistic feedback-based probabilistic approach to identifying streams. Its strength lies in its ability to effectively prefetch streams that are as short as two consecutive cache lines, which allows it to exploit spatial locality even for programs that have irregular access patterns.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["IBM", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Ibrahim Hur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hur:Ibrahim", "Calvin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Calvin"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
