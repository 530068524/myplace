The structure of PARINET is based on a combination of graph partitioning and a set of composite B + -tree local indexes. PARINET is designed for historical data and relies on the distribution of the data over the network as for historical data, the data distribution is known in advance. Because the network can be modeled using graphs, the partitioning of the trajectory data is based on graph partitioning theory and can be tuned for a given query load. The data in each partition is indexed on the time component using B + -trees. We study different types of queries, and provide an optimal configuration for several scenarios. PARINET can easily be integrated into any RDBMS, which is an essential asset particularly for industrial or commercial applications. The experimental evaluation under an off-the-shelf DBMS shows that PARINET is robust. It also significantly outperforms both MON-tree and another R-tree based access method which are the reference indexing techniques for in-network trajectory databases.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["New Jersey Institute of Technology", "PRiSM Laborator ...
