{"title": "Online Learning under Delayed Feedback.", "fields": ["multiplicative function", "feedback loop", "regret", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Online learning with delayed feedback has received increasing attention recently due to its several applications in distributed, web-based learning problems. In this paper we provide a systematic study of the topic, and analyze the effect of delay on the regret of online learning algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that delay increases the regret in a multiplicative way in adversarial problems, and in an additive way in stochastic problems. We give meta-algorithms that transform, in a black-box fashion, algorithms developed for the non-delayed case into ones that can handle the presence of delays in the feedback loop. Modifications of the well-known UCB algorithm are also developed for the bandit problem with delayed feedback, with the advantage over the meta-algorithms that they can be implemented with lower complexity.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Pooria Joulani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joulani:Pooria", "Andr\u00e1s Gy\u00f6rgy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gy=ouml=rgy:Andr=aacute=s", "Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szepesv=aacute=ri:Csaba"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
