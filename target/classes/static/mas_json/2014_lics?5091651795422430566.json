{"title": "Transition systems over games.", "fields": ["nested word", "transition system", "game semantics", "bisimulation", "morphism"], "abstract": "We describe a framework for game semantics combining operational and denotational accounts. A game is a bipartite graph of \"passive\" and \"active\" positions, or a categorical variant with morphisms between positions.   The operational part of the framework is given by a labelled transition system in which each state sits in a particular position of the game. From a state in a passive position, transitions are labelled with a valid O-move from that position, and take us to a state over the updated position. Transitions from states in an active position are likewise labelled with a valid P-move, but silent transitions are allowed, which must take us to a state in the same position.   The denotational part is given by a \"transfer\" from one game to another, a kind of program that converts moves between the two games, giving an operation on strategies. The agreement between the two parts is given by a relation called a \"stepped bisimulation\".   The framework is illustrated by an example of substitution within a lambda-calculus.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Birmingham", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "authors": ["Paul Blain Levy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levy:Paul_Blain", "Sam Staton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Staton:Sam"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
