We extend previous N-best algorithms from the speech community to incorporate non-maximal suppression cues, such that pixel-shifted copies of a single configuration are not returned. We use approximate algorithms that perform nearly identical to their exact counterparts, but are orders of magnitude faster. Our approach outperforms standard methods for generating multiple object configurations in an image. We use our method to generate multiple pose hypotheses for the problem of human pose estimation from video sequences. We present quantitative results that demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of a state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (112)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Dennis Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Dennis", "Deva Ramanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanan:Deva"], "pages": 8}
