{"title": "Improving Retrieval Quality Using Pseudo Relevance Feedback in Content-Based Image Retrieval.", "fields": ["content based image retrieval", "relevance feedback", "visual word", "binary image", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "The increased availability of image capturing devices has enabled collections of digital images to rapidly expand in both size and diversity. This has created a constantly growing need for efficient and effective image browsing, searching, and retrieval tools. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) has proven to be an effective mechanism for improving retrieval accuracy. An original, simple yet effective rank-based PRF mechanism (RB-PRF) that takes into account the initial rank order of each image to improve retrieval accuracy is proposed. This RB-PRF mechanism innovates by making use of binary image signatures to improve retrieval precision by promoting images similar to highly ranked images and demoting images similar to lower ranked images. Empirical evaluations based on standard benchmarks, namely Wang, Oliva & Torralba, and Corel datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RB-PRF mechanism in image retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology"], "authors": ["Dinesha Chathurani Nanayakkara Wasam Uluwitige.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uluwitige:Dinesha_Chathurani_Nanayakkara_Wasam", "Timothy Chappell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chappell:Timothy", "Shlomo Geva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geva:Shlomo", "Vinod Chandran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandran:Vinod"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
