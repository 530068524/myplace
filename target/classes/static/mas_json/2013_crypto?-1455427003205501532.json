{"title": "Highly-Scalable Searchable Symmetric Encryption with Support for Boolean Queries.", "fields": ["probabilistic encryption", "inverted index", "full text search", "symmetric key algorithm", "conjunctive query"], "abstract": "This work presents the design and analysis of the first searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) protocol that supports conjunctive search and general Boolean queries on outsourced symmetrically- encrypted data and that scales to very large databases and arbitrarily-structured data including free text search. To date, work in this area has focused mainly on single-keyword search. For the case of conjunctive search, prior SSE constructions required work linear in the total number of documents in the database and provided good privacy only for structured attribute-value data, rendering these solutions too slow and inflexible for large practical databases.", "citation": "Citations (434)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "University of California, Irvine", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["David Cash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cash:David", "Stanislaw Jarecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jarecki:Stanislaw", "Charanjit S.
