{"title": "Designing Brutal Multiplayer Video Games.", "fields": ["video game design", "metagaming", "video game culture", "game art design", "game design document"], "abstract": "Non-digital forms of play that allow players to direct brute force directly upon each other, such as martial arts, boxing and full contact team sports, are very popular. However, inter-player brutality has largely been unexplored as a feature of digital gaming. In this paper, we describe the design and study of 2 multi-player games that encourage players to use brute force directly against other players. Balance of Power is a tug-of-war style game implemented with Xbox Kinect, while Bundle is a playground-inspired chasing game implemented with smartphones. Two groups of five participants (n=10) played both games while being filmed, and were subsequently interviewed. A thematic analysis identified five key components of the brutal multiplayer video game experience, which informs a set of seven design considerations. This work aims to inspire the design of engaging game experiences based on awareness and enjoyment of our own and others' physicality.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University College Cork", "University of Nottingham"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Joe Marshall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marshall:Joe", "Conor Linehan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linehan:Conor", "Adrian Hazzard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazzard:Adrian"], "pages": 12}
