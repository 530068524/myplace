As a human programmer looks for a bug, it would be helpful to see a complete trace of events leading to the point of failure. Unfortunately, full tracing is simply too slow to use in deployment, and may even be impractical during testing.   We aid post-deployment debugging by giving programmers additional information about program activity shortly before failure. We use latent information in post-failure memory dumps, augmented by low-overhead, tunable run-time tracing. Our results with a realistically-tuned tracing scheme show low enough overhead (0-5%) to be used in production runs. We demonstrate several potential uses of this enhanced information, including a novel postmortem static slice restriction technique and a reduced view of potentially-executed code. Experimental evaluation shows our approach to be very effective, such as shrinking stack-sensitive interprocedural static slices by 49-78% in larger applications.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Peter Ohmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohmann:Peter", "Ben Liblit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liblit:Ben"], "pages": 11}
