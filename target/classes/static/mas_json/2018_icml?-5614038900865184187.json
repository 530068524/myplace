However, this promise is currently largely unrealized. We present a method that is designed to capture a new speaker from a short untranscribed audio sample. This is done by employing an additional network that given an audio sample, places the speaker in the embedding space. This network is trained as part of the speech synthesis system using various consistency losses. Our results demonstrate a greatly improved performance on both the dataset speakers, and, more importantly, when fitting new voices, even from very short samples.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Facebook", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Eliya Nachmani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nachmani:Eliya", "Adam Polyak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polyak:Adam", "Yaniv Taigman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taigman:Yaniv", "Lior Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Lior"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
