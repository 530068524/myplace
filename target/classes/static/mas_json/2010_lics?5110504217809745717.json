For every surface  S , a property P of graphs embeddable in  S  is decidable in polynomial time if and only if it is definable in fixed-point logic with counting. It is a consequence of this result that for every surface  S  there is a  k  such that a simple combinatorial algorithm, namely \u201cthe  k -dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm\u201d, decides isomorphism of graphs embeddable in  S  in polynomial time.   We also present (without proof) generalizations of these results to arbitrary classes of graphs with excluded minors.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Humboldt University of Berlin", "Humboldt University of Berlin"], "authors": ["Martin Grohe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grohe:Martin"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
