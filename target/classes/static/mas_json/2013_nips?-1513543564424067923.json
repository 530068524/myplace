As a consequence, it is generally impossible to obtain an exact characterization of the probability distribution of the parameter estimates. This in turn implies that it is extremely challenging to quantify the uncertainty associated with a certain parameter estimate. Concretely, no commonly accepted procedure exists for computing classical measures of uncertainty and statistical significance as confidence intervals or p-values.\n\nWe consider here a broad class of regression problems, and propose an efficient algorithm for constructing confidence intervals and p-values. The resulting confidence intervals have nearly optimal size. When testing for the null hypothesis that a certain parameter is vanishing, our method has nearly optimal power.\n\nOur approach is based on constructing a 'de-biased' version of regularized M-estimators. The new construction improves over recent work in the field in that it does not assume a special structure on the design matrix. Furthermore, proofs are remarkably simple. We test our method on a diabetes prediction problem.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Adel Javanmard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Javanmard:Adel", "Andrea Montanari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montanari:Andrea"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
