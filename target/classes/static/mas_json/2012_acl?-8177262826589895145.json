However, as more and more real time large-scale tagging applications arise, decoding speed has become a bottleneck for existing sequential tagging algorithms. In this paper we propose 1-best A*, 1-best iterative A*, k-best A* and k-best iterative Viterbi A* algorithms for sequential decoding. We show the efficiency of these proposed algorithms for five NLP tagging tasks. In particular, we show that iterative Viterbi A* decoding can be several times or orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm for tagging tasks with a large number of labels. This algorithm makes real-time large-scale tagging applications with thousands of labels feasible.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhiheng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zhiheng", "Yi Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yi", "Bo Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Bo", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Crespo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crespo:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois", "Anlei Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Anlei", "Sathiya Keerthi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keerthi:Sathiya", "Su-Lin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Su=Lin"], "pages": 9}
