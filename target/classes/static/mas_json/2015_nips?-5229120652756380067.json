Recurrent neural networks have been successful in capturing long-range dependencies in a number of problems but only recently have found their way into generative image models. We here introduce a recurrent image model based on multidimensional long short-term memory units which are particularly suited for image modeling due to their spatial structure. Our model scales to images of arbitrary size and its likelihood is computationally tractable. We find that it outperforms the state of the art in quantitative comparisons on several image datasets and produces promising results when used for texture synthesis and inpainting.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of T\u00fcbingen"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Lucas Theis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theis:Lucas", "Matthias Bethge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bethge:Matthias"], "pages": 9}
