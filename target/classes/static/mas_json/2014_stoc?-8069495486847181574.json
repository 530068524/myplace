{"title": "Constant factor approximation for balanced cut in the PIE model.", "fields": ["invariant", "cut", "vertex", "maximum cut", "permutation"], "abstract": "We propose and study a new semi-random semi-adversarial model for Balanced Cut,  a planted model with permutation invariant random edges  (PIE). Our model is much more general than planted models considered previously. Consider a set of vertices  V  partitioned into two clusters  L  and  R  of equal size. Let  G  be an arbitrary graph on  V  with no edges between  L  and  R . Let  E  random  be a set of edges sampled from an arbitrary  permutation-invariant  distribution (a distribution that is invariant under permutation of vertices in  L  and in  R ). Then we say that  G+E  random  is a graph with permutation-invariant random edges.   We present an approximation algorithm for the Balanced Cut problem that finds a balanced cut of cost  O (| E  random |)+ n  polylog( n ) in this model. In the regime when | E  random | = \u03a9( n  polylog( n )), this is a constant factor approximation with respect to the cost of the planted cut.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Carnegie Mellon University", "TTIC"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Konstantin Makarychev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makarychev:Konstantin", "Yury Makarychev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makarychev:Yury", "Aravindan Vijayaraghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vijayaraghavan:Aravindan"], "pages": 9}
