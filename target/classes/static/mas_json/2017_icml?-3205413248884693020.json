While there are strong theoretical guarantees on the performance of Greedy for maximizing submodular functions, there are few guarantees for non-submodular ones. However, Greedy enjoys strong empirical performance for many important non-submodular functions, e.g., the Bayesian A-optimality objective in experimental design. We prove theoretical guarantees supporting the empirical performance. Our guarantees are characterized by a combination of the (generalized) curvature $\\alpha$ and the submodularity ratio $\\gamma$. In particular, we prove that Greedy enjoys a tight approximation guarantee of $\\frac{1}{\\alpha}(1- e^{-\\gamma\\alpha})$ for cardinality constrained maximization. In addition, we bound the submodularity ratio and curvature for several important real-world objectives, including the Bayesian A-optimality objective, the determinantal function of a square submatrix and certain linear programs with combinatorial constraints. We experimentally validate our theoretical findings for both synthetic and real-world applications.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Andrew An Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Andrew_An", "Joachim M.
