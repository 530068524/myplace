In many practical tasks it usually builds multiple hash tables for a desired level of recall performance. However, existing multi-table hashing methods suffer from the heavy table redundancy, without strong table complementarity and effective hash code learning. To address the problem, this paper proposes a multi-table learning method which pursues a specified number of complementary and informative hash tables from a perspective of ensemble learning. By regarding each hash table as a neighbor prediction model, the multi-table search procedure boils down to a linear assembly of predictions stemming from multiple tables. Therefore, a sequential updating and learning framework is naturally established in a boosting mechanism, theoretically guaranteeing the table complementarity and algorithmic convergence. Furthermore, each boosting round pursues the discriminative hash functions for each table by a discrete optimization in the binary code space. Extensive experiments carried out on two popular tasks including Euclidean and semantic nearest neighbor search demonstrate that the proposed boosted complementary hash-tables method enjoys the strong table complementarity and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Xidian University", "Peking University", "Beihang University"], "authors": ["Xianglong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xianglong", "Cheng Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Cheng", "Yadong Mu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mu:Yadong", "Zhujin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhujin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
