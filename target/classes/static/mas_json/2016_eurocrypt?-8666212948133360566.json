We discuss techniques to accelerate the speed of the progressive BKZ algorithm by optimizing the following parameters: blocksize, searching radius and probability for pruning of the local enumeration algorithm, and the constant in the geometric series assumption GSA. We then propose a simulator for predicting the length of the Gram-Schmidt basis obtained from the BKZ reduction. We also present a model for estimating the computational cost of the proposed progressive BKZ by considering the efficient implementation of the local enumeration algorithm and the LLL algorithm. Finally, we compare the cost of the proposed progressive BKZ with that of other algorithms using instances from the Darmstadt SVP Challenge. The proposed algorithm is approximately 50 times faster than BKZ 2.0 proposed by Chen-Nguyen for solving the SVP Challenge upi\u00be?to 160 dimensions.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "Kyushu University", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "Kyushu University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Yoshinori Aono.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aono:Yoshinori", "Yuntao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuntao", "Takuya Hayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayashi_0001:Takuya", "Tsuyoshi Takagi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takagi:Tsuyoshi"], "pages": 31}
