{"title": "COP: to compress and protect main memory.", "fields": ["interleaved memory", "registered memory", "memory rank", "memory scrubbing", "memory controller"], "abstract": "Protecting main memories from soft errors typically requires special dual-inline memory modules (DIMMs) which incorporate at least one extra chip per rank to store error-correcting codes (ECC). This increases the cost of the DIMM as well as its power consumption. To avoid these costs, some proposals have suggested protecting non-ECC DIMMs by allocating a portion of memory space to store ECC metadata. However, such proposals can significantly shrink the available memory space while degrading performance due to extra memory accesses. In this work, we propose a technique called COP which uses block-level compression to make room for ECC check bits in DRAM. Because a compressed block with check bits is the same size as an uncompressed block, no extra memory accesses are required and the memory space is not reduced. Unlike other approaches that require explicit compression-tracking metadata, COP employs a novel mechanism that relies on ECC to detect compressed data. Our results show that COP can reduce the DRAM soft error rate by 93% with no storage overhead and negligible impact on performance. We also propose a technique using COP to protect both compressible and incompressible data with minimal storage and performance overheads.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["David J.
