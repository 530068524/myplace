{"title": "Designing a context-aware assistive infrastructure for elderly care.", "fields": ["android", "simulation", "systems design", "health care", "internet of things"], "abstract": "We present an assistive healthcare platform, CARE, which aims to provide daily support for elderly caregivers with context-aware, unobtrusive, and actionable information. This information is collected through a plethora of IoT sensors installed strategically at an elderly care centre and is accessed through an Android tablet application. The application's goal is to empower nurses with a better understanding of elderly needs and ultimately, improve the care service. We investigate how IoT devices and sensors can enable a pervasive healthcare system, and discuss a wide-range of important parameters for integration of elderly care practices.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Melbourne", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "authors": ["Simon Klakegg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klakegg:Simon", "Niels van Berkel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berkel:Niels_van", "Aku Visuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Visuri:Aku", "Hanna-Leena Huttunen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huttunen:Hanna=Leena", "Simo Hosio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosio:Simo", "Chu Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Chu", "Jorge Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves:Jorge", "Denzil Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Denzil"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
