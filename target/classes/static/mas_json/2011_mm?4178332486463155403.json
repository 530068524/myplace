{"title": "Spatially-coherent pyramid matching based on max-pooling.", "fields": ["pooling", "computer vision", "pyramid", "machine learning"], "abstract": "This paper presents a method of max-pooling spatially-coherent pyramid matching (MpScPM). Higher-layer representations are generated from lower-layer subregions, by a biologically-inspired max pooling strategy. Second, instead of reshaping the pyramid representation into a vector (used in generic SPM), the layer and location information of each subregion are kept and weak geometrical correspondences between matched subregions are explored to enhance our pyramid matching method. To enhance the possibility of finding the best matches at different scales and locations, cross-layer region similarities are computed, while the correspondences (either spatial neighbors or adjacent layers) are also incorporated. We evaluate our proposed MpScPM method on several existing benchmark datasets and it achieves excellent performances.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Xiangang Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiangang", "Liang-Tien Chia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chia:Liang=Tien"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
