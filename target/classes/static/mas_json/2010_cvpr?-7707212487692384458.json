A principal challenge of this problem is how to estimate the point spread function (PSF) of the spatially variant blur. Based on the projective motion blur model of [27], we present a blur estimation technique that jointly utilizes a coded exposure camera and simple user interactions to recover the PSF. With this spatially variant PSF, objects that exhibit projective motion can be effectively de-blurred. We validate this method with several challenging image examples.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "Microsoft", "KAIST"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yu-Wing Tai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tai:Yu=Wing", "Naejin Kong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kong:Naejin", "Stephen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Stephen", "Sung Yong Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Sung_Yong"], "pages": 8}
