Aiming at supporting early detection and resolution for them, we have conducted an empirical study on thousands of vulnerabilities and found that many of them are recurring due to software reuse. Based on the knowledge gained from the study, we developed SecureSync, an automatic tool to detect recurring software vulnerabilities on the systems that reuse source code or libraries. The core of SecureSync includes two techniques to represent and compute the similarity of vulnerable code across different systems. The evaluation for 60 vulnerabilities on 176 releases of 119 open-source software systems shows that SecureSync is able to detect recurring vulnerabilities with high accuracy and to identify 90 releases having potentially vulnerable code that are not reported or fixed yet, even in mature systems. A couple of cases were actually confirmed by their developers.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Nam H.
