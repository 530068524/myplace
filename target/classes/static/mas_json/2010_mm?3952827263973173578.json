In order to avoid expensive labeling the target-domain data, Active Learning can be used to incrementally learn a target classifier by reusing the one in the source domain. It uses a discriminative query strategy and picks the most ambiguous samples to label, which could fail if the distribution difference is too large. In this paper, to deal with large difference in data distributions, we propose a generative query strategy which is then combined with the existing discriminative one to yield a hybrid method. This method adaptively fits the distribution differences and gives a mixture strategy that performs more robustly compared to both single strategies. Experimental results on TRECVID semantic concept detection task demonstrate superior performance of our hybrid method.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Beihang University"], "authors": ["Huan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Huan", "Yuan Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Yuan", "Ming-yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ming=yu", "Alexander G.
