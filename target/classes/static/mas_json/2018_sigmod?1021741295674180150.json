{"title": "PISTIS: A Conflict of Interest Declaration and Detection System for Peer Review Management.", "fields": ["heterogeneous network", "peer review", "conflict of interest", "conference management", "declaration"], "abstract": "Detecting conflicts of interest (COIs) is key for guaranteeing the fairness of a peer-review process. In many conference management systems, the COIs of authors and reviewers are self-declared, and the declaration process is time consuming and potentially incomplete. To address this problem, we demonstrate a novel interactive system called PISTIS that assists the declaration process in a semi-automatic manner. Apart from keyword search and simple filtering, our system provides an interactive graphical interface that helps users explore potential COIs based on the heterogenous data sources. To simply the process of declaration, we also recommend latent COIs using a supervised ranking model that can be iteratively refined from the data collected from past declarations. We believe that PISTIS can be useful as an assistant tool in many real world conference management systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Macau", "University of Macau", "Nanyang Technological University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Siyuan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Siyuan", "Leong Hou U.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/U:Leong_Hou", "Sourav S.
