Whilst the case for only two objects can be solved globally, when multiple objects are considered usually iterative methods are used. In practice the iterative methods perform well if the relative transformations between any pair of objects are free of noise. However, if only noisy relative transformations are available (e.g. due to missing data or wrong correspondences) the iterative methods may fail.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "Trier University of Applied Sciences", "Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg", "Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Florian Bernard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bernard:Florian", "Johan Thunberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thunberg:Johan", "Peter Gemmar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gemmar:Peter", "Frank Hertel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hertel:Frank", "Andreas Husch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Husch:Andreas", "Jorge M.
