Our proposed approach automatically determines the optimal number of features and selects the best subset accordingly by maximizing the average pairwise informativeness, thus has obvious advantage over traditional filter methods. By relaxing the essential combinatorial optimization problem into the standard quadratic programming problem, the most informative feature subset can be obtained efficiently, and a strategy to dynamically compute the redundancy between feature pairs further greatly accelerates our method through avoiding unnecessary computations of mutual information. As shown by the extensive experiments, the proposed method can successfully select the most informative subset of features, and the obtained classification results significantly outperform the state-of-the-art results on most test datasets.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "National University of Singapore", "Temple University", "National University of Singapore", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Si Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Si", "Hairong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hairong", "Longin Jan Latecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Latecki:Longin_Jan", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng", "Changsheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Changsheng", "Hanqing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hanqing"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
