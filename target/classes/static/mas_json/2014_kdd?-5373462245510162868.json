{"title": "A multi-class boosting method with direct optimization.", "fields": ["lpboost", "linear classifier", "one class classification", "gradient boosting", "brownboost"], "abstract": "We present a direct multi-class boosting (DMCBoost) method for classification with the following properties: (i) instead of reducing the multi-class classification task to a set of binary classification tasks, DMCBoost directly solves the multi-class classification problem, and only requires very weak base classifiers; (ii) DMCBoost builds an ensemble classifier by directly optimizing the non-convex performance measures, including the empirical classification error and margin functions, without resorting to any upper bounds or approximations. As a non-convex optimization method, DMCBoost shows competitive or better results than state-of-the-art convex relaxation boosting methods, and it performs especially well on the noisy cases.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Wright State University", "Wright State University", "Wright State University"], "authors": ["Shaodan Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Shaodan", "Tian Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Tian", "Shaojun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shaojun"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
