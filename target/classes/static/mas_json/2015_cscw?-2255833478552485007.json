{"title": "Content and Network Dynamics Behind Egyptian Political Polarization on Twitter.", "fields": ["polarization", "network dynamics", "narrative", "international community", "mobilization"], "abstract": "There is little doubt about whether social networks play a role in modern protests. This agreement has triggered an entire research avenue, in which social structure and content analysis have been central - but are typically exploited separately.   Here, we combine these two approaches to shed light on the opinion evolution dynamics in Egypt during the summer of 2013 along two axes (Islamist/Secularist, pro/anti-military intervention). We intend to find traces of opinion changes in Egypt's population, paralleling those in the international community - which oscillated from sympathetic to condemnatory as civil clashes grew. We find little evidence of people \"switching\" sides but observe clear changes in volume with both pro- and anti-military camps becoming more active at different stages.   Our work contributes new insights into the dynamics of large protest movements, specially in the aftermath of the main events - rather unattended previously. It questions the standard narrative concerning a simplistic mapping between Secularist/pro-military and Islamist/anti-military. Finally, our conclusions provide empirical validation to sociological models regarding the behavior of individuals in conflictive contexts.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Javier Borge-Holthoefer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borge=Holthoefer:Javier", "Walid Magdy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magdy:Walid", "Kareem Darwish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darwish:Kareem", "Ingmar Weber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weber:Ingmar"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
