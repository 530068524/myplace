State-of-the-art hashing-based counting algorithms use an NP oracle (SAT solver in practice), such that the number of oracle invocations grows linearly in the number of variables n in the input constraint. We present a new approach to hashing-based approximate model counting in which the number of oracle invocations grows logarithmically in n, while still providing strong theoretical guarantees. We use this technique to design an algorithm for #CNF with strongly probably approximately correct (SPAC) guarantees, i.e. PAC guarantee plus expected return value matching the exact model count. Our experiments show that this algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for approximate counting by 1-2 orders of magnitude in running time. We also show that our algorithm can be easily adapted to give a new fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for #DNF.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Rice University", "Rice University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Supratik Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty:Supratik", "Kuldeep S.
