It is both simple and effective. When the number of topics (or latent groups) is unknown, the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) provides an elegant non-parametric extension; however, it is a complex model and it is difficult to incorporate prior knowledge since the distribution over topics is implicit. We propose two new models that extend LDA in a simple and intuitive fashion by directly expressing a distribution over the number of topics. We also propose a new online Bayesian moment matching technique to learn the parameters and the number of topics of those models based on streaming data. The approach achieves higher log-likelihood than batch and online HDP with fixed hyperparameters on several corpora.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Wei-Shou Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Wei=Shou", "Pascal Poupart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poupart:Pascal"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
