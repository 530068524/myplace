The performance scalability of these systems, however, is limited due to partitioning overheads. This paper addresses two of the key performance scalability limitations of composable multicore systems. We present a critical path analysis revealing that communication needed for cross-core register value delivery and fetch stalls due to misspeculation are the two worst bottlenecks that prevent efficient scaling to a large number of fused cores. To alleviate these bottlenecks, this paper proposes a fully distributed framework to exploit criticality in these architectures at different granularities. A coordinator core exploits different types of block-level communication criticality information to fine-tune critical instructions at decode and register forward pipeline stages of their executing cores. The framework exploits the fetch criticality information at a coarser granularity by reissuing all instructions in the blocks previously fetched into the merged cores. This general framework reduces competing bottlenecks in a synergic manner and achieves scalable performance/power efficiency for sequential programs when running across a large number of cores.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Microsoft", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Behnam Robatmili.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robatmili:Behnam", "Madhu Saravana Sibi Govindan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Govindan:Madhu_Saravana_Sibi", "Doug Burger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burger:Doug", "Stephen W.
