{"title": "Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters.", "fields": ["machine learning", "persona", "latent variable", "testbed", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We present two latent variable models for learning character types, or personas, in film, in which a persona is defined as a set of mixtures over latent lexical classes. These lexical classes capture the stereotypical actions of which a character is the agent and patient, as well as attributes by which they are described. As the first attempt to solve this problem explicitly, we also present a new dataset for the text-driven analysis of film, along with a benchmark testbed to help drive future work in this area.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["David Bamman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bamman:David", "Brendan O'Connor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Connor:Brendan", "Noah A.
