{"title": "Overcoming Key Weaknesses of Distance-based Neighbourhood Methods using a Data Dependent Dissimilarity Measure.", "fields": ["distance measures", "machine learning", "cluster analysis", "neighbourhood", "anomaly detection"], "abstract": "This paper introduces the first generic version of data dependent dissimilarity and shows that it provides a better closest match than distance measures for three existing algorithms in clustering, anomaly detection and multi-label classification. For each algorithm, we show that by simply replacing the distance measure with the data dependent dissimilarity measure, it overcomes a key weakness of the otherwise unchanged algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Federation University Australia", "Monash University, Clayton campus", "Monash University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Kai Ming Ting.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Ting:Kai_Ming", "Ye Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Ye", "Mark James Carman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carman:Mark_James", "Yue Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yue", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
