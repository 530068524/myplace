{"title": "Measurement Data Reduction through Variation Rate Metering.", "fields": ["data reduction", "network analysis", "probabilistic logic", "bloom filter", "predictability"], "abstract": "We present an ef\ufb01cient network measurement primitive that measures the rate of variations, or unique values for a given characteristic of a traf\ufb01c \ufb02ow. The primitive is widely applicable to a variety of data reduction and pre-analysis tasks at the measurement interface, and we show it to be particularly useful for building data-reducing preanalysis stages for scan detection within a multistage network analysis architecture. The presented approach is based upon data structures derived from Bloom \ufb01lters, and as such yields high performance with probabilistic accuracy and controllable worst-case time and memory complexity. This predictability makes it suitable for hardware implementation in dedicated network measurement devices. One key innovation of the present work is that it is self-tuning, adapting to the characteristics of the measured traf\ufb01c.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... a, Rome, Italy", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... a, Rome, Italy"], "authors": ["Giuseppe Bianchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bianchi_0001:Giuseppe", "Elisa Boschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boschi:Elisa", "Simone Teofili.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teofili:Simone", "Brian Trammell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trammell:Brian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
