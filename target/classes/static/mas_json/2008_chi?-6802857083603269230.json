{"title": "Handsaw: tangible exploration of volumetric data by direct cut-plane projection.", "fields": ["data set", "product design", "scientific visualization", "user interface", "tangible user interface"], "abstract": "Tangible User Interfaces are well-suited to handling three-dimensional data sets by direct manipulation of real objects in space, but current interfaces can make it difficult to look  inside  dense volumes of information. This paper presents the Handsaw, a system that detects a virtual cut-plane projected by an outstretched hand or laser-line directly on an object or space and reveals sectional data on an adjacent display. By leaving the hands free and using a remote display, these techniques can be shared between multiple users and integrated into everyday practice. The Handsaw has been prototyped for scientific visualizations in medicine, engineering and urban design. User evaluations suggest that using a hand is more intuitive while projected light is more precise than keyboard and mouse control, and the Handsaw system has the potential to be used effectively by novices and in groups.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Leonardo Bonanni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonanni:Leonardo", "Jason Alonso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alonso:Jason", "Neil Chao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chao:Neil", "Greg Vargas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vargas:Greg", "Hiroshi Ishii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishii_0001:Hiroshi"], "pages": 4}
