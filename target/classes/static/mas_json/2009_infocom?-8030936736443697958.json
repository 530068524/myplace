{"title": "The Capacity Allocation Paradox.", "fields": ["packet switching", "infinity", "frequency allocation", "network topology", "wormhole"], "abstract": "The Capacity Allocation Paradox (CAP) destabilizes a stable small-buffer network when a link capacity is increased. CAP is demonstrated in a basic 2 times 1 network topology. We show that it applies to fluid, wormhole and packet-switched networks, and prove that it applies to various scheduling algorithms such as fixed-priority, round-robin and exhaustive round-robin. Their capacity regions are modeled and surprising phenomena are described. For instance, once increasing a link capacity destabilizes a stable network, increasing it further to infinity might never restore stability. Further, we exhibit networks with arbitrarily tight link-capacity stability regions, in which any small deviation from an optimal link capacity might make the network unstable. Finally, we suggest ways to mitigate CAP, e.g. by using GPS scheduling.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Asaf Baron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baron:Asaf", "Ran Ginosar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ginosar:Ran", "Isaac Keslassy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keslassy:Isaac"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
