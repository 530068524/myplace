When facing high-dimensional feature spaces, such a problem becomes extremely hard considering the computation efficiency and quality of approximations. We propose a new algorithm, LSTD($\\lambda$)-RP, which leverages random projection techniques and takes eligibility traces into consideration to tackle the above two challenges. We carry out theoretical analysis of LSTD($\\lambda$)-RP, and provide meaningful upper bounds of the estimation error, approximation error and total generalization error. These results demonstrate that LSTD($\\lambda$)-RP can benefit from random projection and eligibility traces strategies, and LSTD($\\lambda$)-RP can achieve better performances than prior LSTD-RP and LSTD($\\lambda$) algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Haifang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Haifang", "Yingce Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Yingce", "Wensheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wensheng"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
