{"title": "Keeping Up with the Tweet-dashians: The Impact of 'Official' Accounts on Online Rumoring.", "fields": ["denial", "social computing", "mainstream", "rumor", "digital media"], "abstract": "This paper examines how \u00e2  official\u00e2   accounts participate in the propagation and correction of online rumors in the context of crisis events. Using an emerging method for interpretive analysis of \u00e2  big\u00e2   social data, we investigate the spread of online rumors through digital traces\u00e2  in this case, tweets. Our study suggests that official accounts can help to slow the spread of a rumor by posting a denial, and\u00e2  supported by reflections from an organization that recently dealt with a rumor-crisis\u00e2  offers best practices for organizations around social media strategies and protocols. Based on tweet data and connections to existing literature, we also demonstrate and discuss how mainstream media participate in rumoring, and note the role of a new breed of online media, \u00e2  breaking news\u00e2   accounts. This analysis offers a complementary perspective to existing studies that use surveys and interviews to characterize the role official accounts play in online rumoring.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Cynthia A.
