{"title": "Learning to Extract International Relations from Political Context.", "fields": ["politics", "statistical model", "international relations", "topic model", "parsing"], "abstract": "We describe a new probabilistic model for extracting events between major political actors from news corpora. Our unsupervised model brings together familiar components in natural language processing (like parsers and topic models) with contextual political information\u2014 temporal and dyad dependence\u2014to infer latent event classes. We quantitatively evaluate the model\u2019s performance on political science benchmarks: recovering expert-assigned event class valences, and detecting real-world conflict. We also conduct a small case study based on our model\u2019s inferences.
