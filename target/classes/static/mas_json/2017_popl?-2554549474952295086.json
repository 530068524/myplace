{"title": "Contextual isomorphisms.", "fields": ["call by push value", "order isomorphism", "coimage", "isomorphism", "group isomorphism"], "abstract": "What is the right notion of \"isomorphism\" between types, in a simple type theory? The traditional answer is: a pair of terms that are inverse up to a specified congruence. We firstly argue that, in the presence of effects, this answer is too liberal and needs to be restricted, using Fuhrmann\u00e2  s notion of thunkability in the case of value types (as in call-by-value), or using Munch-Maccagnoni\u00e2  s notion of linearity in the case of computation types (as in call-by-name). Yet that leaves us with different notions of isomorphism for different kinds of type.   This situation is resolved by means of a new notion of \u00e2  contextual\u00e2   isomorphism (or morphism), analogous at the level of types to contextual equivalence of terms. A contextual morphism is a way of replacing one type with the other wherever it may occur in a judgement, in a way that is preserved by the action of any term with holes. For types of pure I\ufffd-calculus, we show that a contextual morphism corresponds to a traditional isomorphism. For value types, a contextual morphism corresponds to a thunkable isomorphism, and for computation types, to a linear isomorphism.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Birmingham"], "authors": ["Paul Blain Levy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levy:Paul_Blain"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 15}
