The fear of the \u201cBig Brother\u201d and the lack of reports giving insights into the real adoption process and concrete usages in industry are barriers to this adoption. We report on a case-study on the adoption and long-term usage (2 years of running system) of such a system in a company focusing on the adoption process and the related challenges we encountered.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano"], "authors": ["Irina Diana Coman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coman:Irina_Diana", "Alberto Sillitti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sillitti:Alberto", "Giancarlo Succi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Succi:Giancarlo"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 11}
