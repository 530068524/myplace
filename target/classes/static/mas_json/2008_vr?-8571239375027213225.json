Our multi-camera system performs full-body 3D reconstruction of human user(s) in real time and renders their image in the virtual space allowing remote users to interact. The paper features a short overview of the technology used for the capturing and reconstruction. Some of the applications where we have successfully demonstrated use of the system in combination with the tele-immersive virtual environment are described. Finally, we address current drawbacks with regard to data capturing and networking and provide some ideas for future work.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Gregorij Kurillo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurillo:Gregorij", "Ruzena Bajcsy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bajcsy:Ruzena", "Klara Nahrstedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nahrstedt:Klara", "Oliver Kreylos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kreylos:Oliver"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
