{"title": "Snap Decisions?: How Users, Content, and Aesthetics Interact to Shape Photo Sharing Behaviors.", "fields": ["snap", "social media", "metadata", "upload", "user generated content"], "abstract": "Participants in social media systems must balance many considerations when choosing what to share and with whom. Sharing with others invites certain risks, as well as potential benefits; achieving the right balance is even more critical when sharing photos, which can be particularly engaging, but potentially compromising. In this paper, we examine photo-sharing decisions as an interaction between high-level user preferences and specific features of the images being shared. Our analysis combines insights from a 96-user survey with metadata from 10.4M photos to develop a model integrating these perspectives to predict permissions settings for uploaded photos. We discuss implications, including how such a model can be applied to provide online sharing experiences that are more safe, more scalable, and more satisfying.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sanjay Kairam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kairam:Sanjay", "Joseph Jofish Kaye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaye:Joseph_Jofish", "John Alexis Guerra G\u00f3mez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=oacute=mez:John_Alexis_Guerra", "David A.
