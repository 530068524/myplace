Our method can be used for broad classes of higher-order and pairwise non-submodular functions. We first revisit a submodular-supermodular procedure (SSP) [19], which is previously studied for higher-order energy optimization. We then present our method as generalization of SSP, which is further shown to generalize several state-of-the-art techniques for higher-order and pairwise non-submodular functions [2, 9, 25]. In the experiments, we apply our method to image segmentation, deconvolution, and binarization, and show improvements over state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Osaka University", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tatsunori Taniai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taniai:Tatsunori", "Yasuyuki Matsushita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsushita:Yasuyuki", "Takeshi Naemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naemura:Takeshi"], "pages": 9}
