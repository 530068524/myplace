We prove bounds on the sample complexity of our algorithms under a mild restriction on the data distribution. We also give an active learning algorithm with improved sample complexity and extend all our algorithms to the random classification noise setting.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Nina Balcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balcan:Nina", "Christopher Berlind.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berlind:Christopher", "Steven Ehrlich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ehrlich:Steven", "Yingyu Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Yingyu"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
