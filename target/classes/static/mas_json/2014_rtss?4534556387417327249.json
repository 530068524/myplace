To support a wide range of high-speed wireless control applications, we presented in our prior work the design and implementation of a flexible real-time high-speed wireless communication platform called RT-WiFi. RT-WiFi currently provides up to 6kHz sampling rate and deterministic timing guarantee on packet delivery. While guaranteed delivery latency is essential for networked control, control performance is also impacted by communication jitter and other QoS parameters. To reduce jitter, a flexible network manager is needed to control network-wide scheduling of packet transportation. In this paper, we present an RT-WiFi network manager design and propose efficient solutions for two fundamental RT-WiFi network management problems. To improve control performance in networked control systems, our RT-WiFi network manager is designed to generate data link layer communication schedule with minimum jitter under both static and dynamic network topologies. In order to minimize network management overhead, an efficient data structure called S-tree is invented to manage the communication requests to deal with network dynamics. We have implemented the RT-WiFi network manager, and validated its network and control performance through extensive experiments with a real application.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Connecticut", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Quan Leng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leng:Quan", "Yi-Hung Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Yi=Hung", "Song Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Song", "Aloysius K.
