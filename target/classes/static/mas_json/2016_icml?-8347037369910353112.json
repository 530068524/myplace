{"title": "Doubly Robust Off-policy Value Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning.", "fields": ["importance sampling", "estimator", "subroutine", "robust statistics", "reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "We study the problem of off-policy value evaluation in reinforcement learning (RL), where one aims to estimate the value of a new policy based on data collected by a different policy. This problem is often a critical step when applying RL to real-world problems. Despite its importance, existing general methods either have uncontrolled bias or suffer high variance. In this work, we extend the doubly robust estimator for bandits to sequential decision-making problems, which gets the best of both worlds: it is guaranteed to be unbiased and can have a much lower variance than the popular importance sampling estimators. We demonstrate the estimator's accuracy in several benchmark problems, and illustrate its use as a subroutine in safe policy improvement. We also provide theoretical results on the inherent hardness of the problem, and show that our estimator can match the lower bound in certain scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Nan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Nan", "Lihong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Lihong"], "pages": 10}
