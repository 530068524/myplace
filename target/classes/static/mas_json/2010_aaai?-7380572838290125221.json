We show that, depending on the required types of temporal and atemporal constraints, the satisfiability problem for temporal knowledge bases in the resulting logics can be NLOGSPACE-, NP- and PSPACE-complete, as well as undecidable.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Birkbeck, University of London", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Birkbeck, University of London"], "authors": ["Alessandro Artale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Artale:Alessandro", "Roman Kontchakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontchakov:Roman", "Vladislav Ryzhikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryzhikov:Vladislav", "Michael Zakharyaschev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zakharyaschev:Michael"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
