{"title": "Analyzing spatially-varying blur.", "fields": ["kernel", "motion blur", "image plane", "mathematics", "gaussian blur", "image restoration"], "abstract": "Blur is caused by a pixel receiving light from multiple scene points, and in many cases, such as object motion, the induced blur varies spatially across the image plane. However, the seemingly straight-forward task of estimating spatially-varying blur from a single image has proved hard to accomplish reliably. This work considers such blur and makes two contributions: a local blur cue that measures the likelihood of a small neighborhood being blurred by a candidate blur kernel; and an algorithm that, given an image, simultaneously selects a motion blur kernel and segments the region that it affects. The methods are shown to perform well on a diversity of images.", "citation": "Citations (155)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ayan Chakrabarti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakrabarti:Ayan", "Todd E.
