STRAND logic (\"STRucture ANd Data\" logic) formulas express constraints involving heap structures and the data they contain; they are defined over a class of pointer-structures  R  defined using MSO-defined relations over trees, and are of the form \u2203\u2192 x \u2200\u2192 y  (\u2192 x ,\u2192)  x \" , where \"\u03c6\" is a monadic second-order logic (MSO) formulawith additional quantification that combines structural constraints as well as data-constraints, but where the data-constraints are only allowed to refer to \"\u2192 x \" and \"\u2192 y \"   The salient aspects of the logic are: (a) the logic is powerful, allowing existential and universal quantification over the nodes, and complex combinations of data and structural constraints; (b) checking Hoare-triples for linear blocks of statements with pre-conditions and post-conditions expressed as Boolean combinations of existential and universal STRAND formulas reduces to satisfiability of a STRAND formula; (c) there are powerful decidable fragments of STRAND, one semantically defined and one syntactically defined, where the decision procedure works by combining the theory of MSO over trees and the quantifier-free theory of the underlying data-logic. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the logic by checking verification conditions generated in proving properties of several heap-manipulating programs, using a tool that combines an MSO decision procedure over trees (MONA) with an SMT solver for integer constraints (Z3).", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Paris", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["P.
