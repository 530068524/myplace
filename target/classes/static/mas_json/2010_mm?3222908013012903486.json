Guiding the user navigation and exploration process through the database contents, similarity-based layouts frequently serve as effective and intuitive user interfaces offering a multitude of easy-to-use query functionalities. In order to process queries arising in similarity-based layouts efficiently, we propose to support content-based exploration systems with index structures. For this purpose, we present a general approach which supports any kind of distance-based index structure. By evaluating our approach, we show that it improves the efficiency of content-based multimedia exploration.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Christian Beecks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beecks:Christian", "Philip Driessen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Driessen:Philip", "Thomas Seidl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidl_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
