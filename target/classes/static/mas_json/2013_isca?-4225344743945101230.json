Data movement and management impacts memory access latency and consumes power. Therefore, harnessing data locality is of fundamental importance in future processors. We propose a scalable, efficient shared memory cache coherence protocol that enables seamless adaptation between private and logically shared caching of on-chip data at the fine granularity of cache lines. Our data-centric approach relies on in-hardware yet low-overhead runtime profiling of the locality of each cache line and only allows private caching for data blocks with high spatio-temporal locality. This allows us to better exploit the private caches and enable low-latency, low-energy memory access, while retaining the convenience of shared memory. On a set of parallel benchmarks, our low-overhead locality-aware mechanisms reduce the overall energy by 25% and completion time by 15% in an NoC-based multicore with the Reactive-NUCA on-chip cache organization and the ACKwise limited directory-based coherence protocol.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Connecticut", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["George Kurian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurian:George", "Omer Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Omer", "Srinivas Devadas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Devadas:Srinivas"], "pages": 12}
