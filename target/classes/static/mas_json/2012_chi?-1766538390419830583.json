We describe a technique for associating multi-touch interactions to individual users and their accelerometer-equipped mobile devices. Real-time device accelerometer data and depth camera-based body tracking are compared to associate each phone with a particular user, while body tracking and touch contacts positions are compared to associate a touch contact with a specific user. It is then possible to associate touch contacts with devices, allowing for more seamless device-display multi-user interactions. We detail the technique and present a user study to validate and demonstrate a content exchange application using this approach.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Mahsan Rofouei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rofouei:Mahsan", "Andrew D.
