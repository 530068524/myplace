Large IT companies have recently increased their efforts in reducing the carbon dioxide footprint originated from their data center electricity consumption. On one hand, better infrastructure and modern hardware allow for a more efficient usage of electric resources. On the other hand, data-centers can be powered by renewable sources (green energy) that are both environmental friendly and economically convenient. In this paper, we tackle the problem of targeting the usage of green energy to minimize the expenditure of running multi-center Web search engines, i.e., systems composed by multiple, geographically remote, computing facilities.\n\nWe propose a mathematical model to minimize the operational costs of multi-center Web search engines by exploiting renewable energies whenever available at different locations. Using this model, we design an algorithm which decides what fraction of the incoming query load arriving into one processing facility must be forwarded to be processed at different sites to use green energy sources.\n\nWe experiment using real traffic from a large search engine and we compare our model against state of the art baselines for query forwarding. Our experimental results show that the proposed solution maintains an high query throughput, while reducing by up to ~25% the energy operational costs of multi-center search engines. Additionally, our algorithm can reduce the brown energy consumption by almost 6% when energy-proportional servers are employed.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione", "Gran Sasso Scie ...
