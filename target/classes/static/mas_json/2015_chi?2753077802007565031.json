{"title": "Cooperative Game Play with Avatars and Agents: Differences in Brain Activity and the Experience of Play.", "fields": ["brain activity and meditation", "simulation", "flow", "cognition", "alpha"], "abstract": "The current study sought to identify the impact of whether teammates in a cooperative videogame were controlled by other humans (avatars) or by the game (agents). The impact on player experience was explored through both subjective questionnaire measures and brain wave activity measurement (electroencephalography). Play with human teammates was associated with a greater sense of relatedness, but less competence and flow than play with other computer-controlled teammates. In terms of brain activity, play with human teammates was associated with greater activity in the alpha, theta and beta power bands than play with computer-controlled teammates. Overall, the results suggest that play with human teammates involves greater cognitive activity in terms of 'mentalising' than play with computer-controlled teammates. Additionally, the associations between subjective measures of player experience and brain activity are described. Limitations of the current study are identified and key directions for future research are discussed.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel M.
