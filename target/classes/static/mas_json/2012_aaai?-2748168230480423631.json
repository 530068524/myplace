{"title": "Social Cognition: Memory Decay and Adaptive Information Filtering for Robust Information Maintenance.", "fields": ["adaptive memory", "graph", "foraging", "social cognition", "memory management"], "abstract": "Two information decay methods are examined that help multi-agent systems cope with dynamic environments. The agents in this simulation have human-like memory and a mechanism to moderate their communications: they forget internally stored information via temporal decay, and they forget distributed information by filtering it as it passes through a communication network. The agents play a foraging game, in which performance depends on communicating facts and requests and on storing facts in internal memory. Parameters of the game and agent models are tuned to human data. Agent groups with moderated communication in small-world networks achieve optimal performance for typical human memory decay values, while non-adaptive agents benefit from stronger memory decay. The decay and filtering strategies interact with the properties of the network graph in ways suggestive of an evolutionary cooptimization between the human cognitive system and an external social structure.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["David Reitter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reitter:David", "Christian Lebiere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lebiere:Christian"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
