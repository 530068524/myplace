The problem of identifying missing tag in RFID systems has attracted wide attention due to its practical importance. This paper presents P-MTI: a Physical-layer Missing Tag Identification scheme which effectively makes use of the lower layer information and dramatically improves operational efficiency. Unlike conventional approaches, P-MTI looks into the aggregated responses instead of focusing on individual tag responses and extracts useful information from physical layer symbols. P-MTI leverages the sparsity of missing tag events and reconstructs tag responses through compressive sensing. We implement P-MTI and prototype the system based on the USRP software defined radio and Intel WISP platform which demonstrates the efficacy. We also evaluate the performance of P-MTI with extensive simulations and compare with previous approaches under various scenarios. The evaluation shows promising results of P-MTI in terms of identification accuracy, time efficiency, as well as robustness over noisy channels.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Yuanqing Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yuanqing", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
