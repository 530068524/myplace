The SNM was recently proposed in [10] to better capture the main characteristics of today Video on Demand (Vod) traffic. In this context, Che's approximation is derived as the application of a mean field principle to the cache eviction time. We investigate the validity of this approximation through an asymptotic analysis of the cache eviction time. Particularly, we provide a large deviation principle and a central limit theorem for the cache eviction time, as the cache size grows large. Furthermore, we obtain a non-asymptotic analytical upper bound on the error entailed by Che's approximation of the hit probability.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Turin", "IAC"], "authors": ["Emilio Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Emilio", "Giovanni Luca Torrisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torrisi:Giovanni_Luca"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
