{"title": "Heuristic Search Comes of Age.", "fields": ["heuristic", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "management science"], "abstract": "In looking back on the last five to ten years of work in heuristic search a few trends emerge. First, there has been a broadening of research topics studied. Second, there has been a deepened understanding of the theoretical foundations of search. Third, and finally, there have been increased connections with work in other fields. This paper, corresponding to a AAAI 2012 invited talk on recent work in heuristic search, highlights these trends in a number of areas of heuristic search. It is our opinion that the sum of these trends reflects the growth in the field and the fact that heuristic search has come of age.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Denver", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of New Hampshire"], "authors": ["Nathan R.
