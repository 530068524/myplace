The proposed scheme enables adaptive control of the trade-off between the encoder's complexity and coding performance by dynamically updating a control parameter during encoding.   This enables the encoder to perform optimally on a variety of computing platforms and runtime environments by adaption to instantaneous available computing resources and varying source video characteristics. The proposed scheme also allows computational resource allocation across layers in SVC encoders.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Institute for I ... pore, Singapore", "Institute for I ... pore, Singapore", "Institute for I ... pore, Singapore"], "authors": ["Yih Han Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Yih_Han", "Wei Siong Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wei_Siong", "Jo Yew Tham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tham:Jo_Yew"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
