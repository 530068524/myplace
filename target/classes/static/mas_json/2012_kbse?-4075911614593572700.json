{"title": "Augmented dynamic symbolic execution.", "fields": ["mutation testing", "correctness", "regression testing", "concolic testing", "design by contract"], "abstract": "Dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) can efficiently explore all simple paths through a program, reliably determining whether there are any program crashes or violations of assertions or code contracts. However, if such automated oracles do not exist, the traditional approach is to present the developer a small and representative set of tests in order to let him/her determine their correctness. Customer feedback on Microsoft's Pex tool revealed that users expect different values and also more values than those produced by Pex, which threatens the applicability of DSE in a scenario without automated oracles. Indeed, even though all paths might be covered by DSE, the resulting tests are usually not sensitive enough to make a good regression test suite. In this paper, we present augmented dynamic symbolic execution, which aims to produce representative test sets by augmenting path conditions with additional conditions that enforce target criteria such as boundary or mutation adequacy, or logical coverage criteria.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Saarland University", "University of Sheffield", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Konrad Jamrozik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jamrozik:Konrad", "Gordon Fraser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fraser:Gordon", "Nikolai Tillmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tillmann:Nikolai", "Jonathan de Halleux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halleux:Jonathan_de"], "pages": 4}
