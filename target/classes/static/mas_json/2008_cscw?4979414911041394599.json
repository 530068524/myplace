Widescale interaction describes the potential for broad, immediate, and varied participation that the conditions of online forums, and social networking sites in particular, increasingly allow. Here, we examine a group on a popular social networking site as a virtual destination in the aftermath of the Northern Illinois University (NIU) shootings of February 14, 2008 in relation to related activity that happened in response to the Virginia Tech (VT) tragedy 10 months earlier. We consider features of interactions that are enabled when a vast audience converges under such conditions. We discuss how commiseration and information seeking are interrelated, and how geographical communities that share a common experience ally in such a public, online setting.", "citation": "Citations (129)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "authors": ["Leysia Palen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palen:Leysia", "Sarah Vieweg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vieweg:Sarah"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
