{"title": "Taming Dynamically Adaptive Systems using models and aspects.", "fields": ["model driven architecture", "middleware", "software system", "combinatorial explosion", "runtime system"], "abstract": "Since software systems need to be continuously available under varying conditions, their ability to evolve at runtime is increasingly seen as one key issue. Modern programming frameworks already provide support for dynamic adaptations. However the high-variability of features in Dynamic Adaptive Systems (DAS) introduces an explosion of possible runtime system configurations (often called modes) and mode transitions. Designing these configurations and their transitions is tedious and error-prone, making the system feature evolution difficult. While Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM) was introduced to improve the modularity of software, this paper presents how an AOM approach can be used to tame the combinatorial explosion of DAS modes. Using AOM techniques, we derive a wide range of modes by weaving aspects into an explicit model reflecting the runtime system. We use these generated modes to automatically adapt the system. We validate our approach on an adaptive middleware for home-automation currently deployed in Rennes metropolis.", "citation": "Citations (257)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Rennes", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Brice Morin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morin:Brice", "Olivier Barais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barais:Olivier", "Gr\u00e9gory Nain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nain:Gr=eacute=gory", "Jean-Marc J\u00e9z\u00e9quel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=eacute=z=eacute=quel:Jean=Marc"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 11}
