In this paper, we consider an algorithm that is based on simple, local comparisons, and analyze it to provide insights into why similar peer discovery algorithms work well in practice. To do so, we use a mathematical framework to characterize the closeness of individual interests, and formally introduce the notion of a \u201cperfect network formation\u201d under the framework. Our analysis shows that the proposed algorithm indeeds achieves perfect network formation. Our analysis uses bounding techniques based on Chernoff bounds.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Felix Ming.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ming:Felix", "Fai Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Fai", "Peter Marbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marbach:Peter"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
