Existing fuzzy ontology reasoners are not scalable enough to handle the scale of data that the Web provides. In this paper, we propose a framework of fuzzy query languages for fuzzy ontologies, and present query answering algorithms for these query languages over fuzzy DL-Lite ontologies. Moreover, this paper reports on implementation of our approach in the fuzzy DL-Lite query engine in the ONTOSEARCH2 system and preliminary, but encouraging, benchmarking results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever scalable query engine for fuzzy ontologies.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "departments": ["University of Aberdeen", "University of Aberdeen", "University of Aberdeen", "NTUA, Athens, Greece", "NTUA, Athens, Greece"], "authors": ["Jeff Z.
