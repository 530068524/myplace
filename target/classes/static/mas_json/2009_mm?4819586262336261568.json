In this paper, we proposed a novel multimodal biometric approach fusing finger vein pattern with finger-dorsa texture. Firstly, Finger Vein image and finger-dorsa image from the same finger are captured simultaneously, and a method is designed to segment Regions Of Interest(ROI) of vein image and dorsal image. Secondly, two strategies are designed to extract finger vein pattern and finger-dorsa texture respectively. Vein extraction strategy consists of four steps: local thresholding, modified line tracking, thorough probability map creating and directional neighbor analysis. Gray normalization is performed on finger-dorsa image to extract main finger-dorsa texture. Thirdly, the binarized vein pattern and normalized dorsal texture are fused into one feature image. Finally, a block-based texture feature is proposed for personal authentication. Experimental results showed that the proposed fusion method outperforms any one of finger-dorsa and finger vein methods.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Wenming Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Wenming", "Xiang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Xiang", "Qingmin Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Qingmin"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
