{"title": "Online Planning for Ad Hoc Autonomous Agent Teams.", "fields": ["convergence", "wireless ad hoc network", "autonomous agent", "repeated game", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We propose a novel online planning algorithm for ad hoc team settings--challenging situations in which an agent must collaborate with unknown teammates without prior coordination. Our approach is based on constructing and solving a series of stage games, and then using biased adaptive play to choose actions. The utility function in each stage game is estimated via Monte-Carlo tree search using the UCT algorithm. We establish analytically the convergence of the algorithm and show that it performs well in a variety of ad hoc team domains.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Feng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Feng", "Shlomo Zilberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zilberstein:Shlomo", "Xiaoping Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiaoping"], "pages": 7}
