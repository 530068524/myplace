We introduce I/O Deduplication, a storage optimization that utilizes content similarity for improving I/O performance by eliminating I/O operations and reducing the mechanical delays during I/O operations. I/O Deduplication consists of three main techniques:  content-based caching, dynamic replica retrieval , and  selective duplication . Each of these techniques is motivated by our observations with I/O workload traces obtained from actively-used production storage systems, all of which revealed surprisingly high levels of content similarity for both stored and accessed data. Evaluation of a prototype implementation using these workloads showed an overall improvement in disk I/O performance of 28 to 47p across these workloads. Further breakdown also showed that each of the three techniques contributed significantly to the overall performance improvement.", "citation": "Citations (230)", "departments": ["Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Florida International University"], "authors": ["Ricardo Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Ricardo", "Raju Rangaswami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangaswami:Raju"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2010", "pages": 14}
