{"title": "Cursing in English on twitter.", "fields": ["social media", "curse", "plural", "social network", "communication"], "abstract": "Cursing is not uncommon during conversations in the physical world: 0.5% to 0.7% of all the words we speak are curse words, given that 1% of all the words are first-person plural pronouns (e.g., we, us, our). On social media, people can instantly chat with friends without face-to-face interaction, usually in a more public fashion and broadly disseminated through highly connected social network. Will these distinctive features of social media lead to a change in people's cursing behavior? In this paper, we examine the characteristics of cursing activity on a popular social media platform - Twitter, involving the analysis of about 51 million tweets and about 14 million users. In particular, we explore a set of questions that have been recognized as crucial for understanding cursing in offline communications by prior studies, including the ubiquity, utility, and contextual dependencies of cursing.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Wright State University", "Wright State University", "Wright State University", "Wright State University"], "authors": ["Wenbo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Wenbo", "Lu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lu", "Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thirunarayan:Krishnaprasad", "Amit P.
