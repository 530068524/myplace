However, some empirical studies show that this is not always true: the combination of multiple kernels may even yield an even worse performance than using a single kernel. There are two possible reasons for the failure: (i) most existing MKL methods assume that the optimal kernel is a linear combination of base kernels, which may not hold true; and (ii) some kernel weights are inappropriately assigned due to noises and carelessly designed algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel MKL framework by following two intuitive assumptions: (i) each kernel is a perturbation of the consensus kernel; and (ii) the kernel that is close to the consensus kernel should be assigned a large weight. Impressively, the proposed method can automatically assign an appropriate weight to each kernel without introducing additional parameters, as existing methods do. The proposed framework is integrated into a unified framework for graph-based clustering and semi-supervised classification. We have conducted experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and our empirical results verify the superiority of the proposed framework.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "JD AI Research, ... g 100101, China"], "authors": ["Zhao Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Zhao", "Xiao Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Xiao", "Jinfeng Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Jinfeng", "Zenglin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zenglin"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
