We first pretrain the deep neural network with a stacked denoising auto-encoder in an unsupervised way. Then, we perform a Bayesian linear regression on the top layer of the pre-trained deep network. The resulting model, Deep-Neural-Network-based Gaussian Process (DNN-GP), can learn much more meaningful representation of the data by the finite-dimensional but deep-layered feature-mapping function. Unlike standard Gaussian processes, our model scales well with the size of the training set due to the avoidance of kernel matrix inversion. Moreover, we present a mixture of DNN-GPs to further improve the regression performance. For the experiments on three representative large datasets, our proposed models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms of Gaussian process regression.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "HTC", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "HTC"], "authors": ["Wen-bing Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Wen=bing", "Deli Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Deli", "Fuchun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Fuchun", "Huaping Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Huaping", "Edward Y.
