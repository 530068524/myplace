{"title": "Job opportunities through entertainment: virally spread speech-based services for low-literate users.", "fields": ["functional illiteracy", "dialog box", "demographics", "software deployment", "entertainment"], "abstract": "We explore how telephone-based services might be mass adopted by low-literate users in the developing world. We focus on speech and push-button dialog systems requiring neither literacy nor training. Building on the success of  Polly , a simple telephone-based voice manipulation and forwarding system that was first tested in 2011, we report on its first large-scale sustained deployment. In 24/7 operation in Pakistan since May 9, 2012, as of mid-September Polly has spread to 85,000 users, engaging them in 495,000 interactions, and is continuing to spread to 1,000 new people daily. It has also attracted 27,000 people to a job search service, who in turn listened 279,000 times to job ads and forwarded them 22,000 times to their friends. We report users' activity over time and across demographics, analyze user behavior within several randomized controlled trials, and describe lessons learned regarding spread, scalability and sustainability of telephone-based speech-based services.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Lahore University of Management Sciences", "Lahore University of Management Sciences", "Northeastern University", "Lahore University of Management Sciences"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Agha Ali Raza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raza:Agha_Ali", "Farhan ul Haq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haq:Farhan_ul", "Zain Tariq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tariq:Zain", "Mansoor Pervaiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pervaiz:Mansoor", "Samia Razaq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Razaq:Samia", "Umar Saif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saif:Umar", "Roni Rosenfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenfeld:Roni"], "pages": 10}
