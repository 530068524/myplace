The most commonly used and studied variant maintains a diagonal matrix approximation to second order information by accumulating past gradients which are used to tune the step size adaptively. In certain situations the full-matrix variant of AdaGrad is expected to attain better performance, however in high dimensions it is computationally impractical. We present Ada-LR and RadaGrad two computationally efficient approximations to full-matrix AdaGrad based on randomized dimensionality reduction. They are able to capture dependencies between features and achieve similar performance to full-matrix AdaGrad but at a much smaller computational cost. We show that the regret of Ada-LR is close to the regret of full-matrix AdaGrad which can have an up-to exponentially smaller dependence on the dimension than the diagonal variant. Empirically, we show that Ada-LR and RadaGrad perform similarly to full-matrix AdaGrad. On the task of training convolutional neural networks as well as recurrent neural networks, RadaGrad achieves faster convergence than diagonal AdaGrad.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Gabriel Krummenacher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krummenacher:Gabriel", "Brian McWilliams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McWilliams:Brian", "Yannic Kilcher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kilcher:Yannic", "Joachim M.
