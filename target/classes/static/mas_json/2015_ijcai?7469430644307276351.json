It was recently shown that the complexity of reasoning in finitely valued fuzzy DLs is often not higher than that of the underlying classical DL. We show that this does not hold for fuzzy extensions of the light-weight DL EL, which is used in many biomedical ontologies, under the \u0141ukasiewicz semantics. The complexity of reasoning increases from PTIME to EXPTIME, even if only one additional truth value is introduced. The same lower bound holds also for infinitely valued \u0141ukasiewicz extensions of EL.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Palack\u00fd University, Olomouc", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano"], "authors": ["Stefan Borgwardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borgwardt:Stefan", "Marco Cerami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cerami:Marco", "Rafael Pe\u00f1aloza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pe=ntilde=aloza:Rafael"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
