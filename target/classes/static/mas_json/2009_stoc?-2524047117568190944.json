Starting with the work of Cole and Vishkin in 1986, a long line of gradually improving algorithms has been published. The state-of-the-art running time, prior to our work, is $O(\\Delta \\log \\Delta + \\log^* n)$, due to Kuhn and Wattenhofer [Proceedings of the $25$th Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, Denver, CO, 2006, pp. 7--15]. Linial [Proceedings of the $28$th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundation of Computer Science, Los Angeles, CA, 1987, pp. 331--335] proved a lower bound of $\\frac{1}{2} \\log^* n$ for the problem, and Szegedy and Vishwanathan [Proceedings of the 25th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, San Diego, CA, 1993, pp. 201--207] provided a heuristic argument that shows that algorithms from a wide family of locally iterative algorithms are unlikely to achieve a running time smaller than $\\Theta(\\Delta \\log \\Delta)$.
