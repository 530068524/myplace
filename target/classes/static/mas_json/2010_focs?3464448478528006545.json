We use this to show that quadratic forms over any field are locally list-decodeable up to their minimum distance. The analogous statement for linear polynomials was proved in the celebrated works of Goldreich-Levin and Goldreich-Rubinfeld-Sudan. Previously, tight bounds for quadratic polynomials were known only for q = 2 or 3, the best bound known for other fields was the Johnson radius. Departing from previous work on Reed-Muller decoding which relies on some form of self-corrector, our work applies ideas from Fourier analysis of Boolean functions to low-degree polynomials over finite fields, in conjunction with results about the weight-distribution. We believe that the techniques used here could find other applications, we present some applications to testing and learning.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Parikshit Gopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalan:Parikshit"], "pages": 10}
