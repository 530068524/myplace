We generalize prior work on hardware tagging by considering a generic architecture that supports software-defined policies over metadata of arbitrary size and complexity; we introduce several novel microarchitectural optimizations that keep the overhead of this rich processing low. Our model thus achieves the efficiency of previous hardware-based approaches with the flexibility of the software-based ones. We demonstrate this by using it to enforce four diverse safety and security policies---spatial and temporal memory safety, taint tracking, control-flow integrity, and code and data separation---plus a composite policy that enforces all of them simultaneously. Experiments on SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks with a PUMP-enhanced RISC processor show modest impact on runtime (typically under 10%) and power ceiling (less than 10%), in return for some increase in energy usage (typically under 60%) and area for on-chip memory structures (110%).", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "BAE Systems"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Udit Dhawan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhawan:Udit", "Catalin Hritcu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hritcu:Catalin", "Raphael Rubin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubin:Raphael", "Nikos Vasilakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasilakis:Nikos", "Silviu Chiricescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiricescu:Silviu", "Jonathan M.
