{"title": "Distributed Private Data Analysis: Simultaneously Solving How and What.", "fields": ["secure multi party computation", "binary number", "model of computation", "symmetric function", "differential privacy"], "abstract": "We examine the combination of two directions in the field of privacy concerning computations over distributed private inputs ---  secure function evaluation (SFE) and  differential privacy . While in both the goal is to privately evaluate some function of the individual inputs, the privacy requirements are significantly different. The general feasibility results for SFE suggest a natural paradigm for implementing differentially private analyses distributively: First choose  what to compute, i.e., a differentially private analysis; Then decide  how to compute it, i.e., construct an SFE protocol for this analysis. We initiate an examination whether there are advantages to a paradigm where both decisions are made simultaneously. In particular, we investigate under which accuracy requirements it is beneficial to adapt this paradigm for computing a collection of functions including Binary Sum, Gap Threshold, and Approximate Median queries. Our results yield new separations between the local and global models of computations for private data analysis.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Amos Beimel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beimel:Amos", "Kobbi Nissim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nissim:Kobbi", "Eran Omri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Omri:Eran"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 18}
