{"title": "Usability and Security of Text Passwords on Mobile Devices.", "fields": ["password policy", "one time password", "password strength", "cognitive password", "mobile search"], "abstract": "Recent research has improved our understanding of how to create strong, memorable text passwords. However, this research has generally been in the context of desktops and laptops, while users are increasingly creating and entering passwords on mobile devices. In this paper we study whether recent password guidance carries over to the mobile setting. We compare the strength and usability of passwords created and used on mobile devices with those created and used on desktops and laptops, while varying password policy requirements and input methods. We find that creating passwords on mobile devices takes significantly longer and is more error prone and frustrating. Passwords created on mobile devices are also weaker, but only against attackers who can make more than 10^13 guesses. We find that the effects of password policies differ between the desktop and mobile environments, and suggest ways to ease password entry for mobile users.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["William Melicher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melicher:William", "Darya Kurilova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurilova:Darya", "Sean M.
