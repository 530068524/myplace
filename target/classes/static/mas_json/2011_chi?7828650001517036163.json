{"title": "Enhancing independence and safety for blind and deaf-blind public transit riders.", "fields": ["braille", "public transport", "autonomy", "value sensitive design", "input output"], "abstract": "Blind and deaf-blind people often rely on public transit for everyday mobility, but using transit can be challenging for them. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 blind and deaf-blind people to understand how they use public transit and what human values were important to them in this domain. Two key values were identified:  independence  and  safety . We developed  GoBraille , two related Braille-based applications that provide information about buses and bus stops while supporting the key values. GoBraille is built on  MoBraille , a novel framework that enables a Braille display to benefit from many features in a smartphone without knowledge of proprietary, device-specific protocols. Finally, we conducted user studies with blind people to demonstrate that GoBraille enables people to travel more independently and safely. We also conducted co-design with a deaf-blind person, finding that a minimalist interface, with short input and output messages, was most effective for this population.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Shiri Azenkot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azenkot:Shiri", "Sanjana Prasain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prasain:Sanjana", "Alan Borning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borning:Alan", "Emily Fortuna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fortuna:Emily", "Richard E.
