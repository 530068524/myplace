{"title": "Conversational Pointing Gestures for Virtual Reality Interaction: Implications from an Empirical Study.", "fields": ["immersion", "deixis", "gesture", "dialog system", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "Interaction in conversational interfaces strongly relies on the system's capability to interpret the user's references to objects via deictic expressions. Deictic gestures, especially pointing gestures, provide a powerful way of referring to objects and places, e.g., when communicating with an embodied conversational agent in a virtual reality environment. We highlight results drawn from a study on pointing and draw conclusions for the implementation of pointing-based conversational interactions in partly immersive virtual reality.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Bielefeld University", "Bielefeld University", "Bielefeld University"], "authors": ["Thies Pfeiffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfeiffer:Thies", "Marc Erich Latoschik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Latoschik:Marc_Erich", "Ipke Wachsmuth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wachsmuth:Ipke"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
