{"title": "Opportunities and Design Considerations for Peer Support in a Hospital Setting.", "fields": ["peer to peer", "health care", "health informatics", "peer support", "online health communities"], "abstract": "Although research has demonstrated improved outcomes for outpatients who receive peer support-such as through online health communities, support groups, and mentoring systems-hospitalized patients have few mechanisms to receive such valuable support. To explore the opportunities for a hospital-based peer support system, we administered a survey to 146 pediatric patients and caregivers, and conducted semi-structured interviews with twelve patients and three caregivers in a children's hospital. Our analysis revealed that hospitalized individuals need peer support for five key purposes: (1) to ask about medical details-such as procedures, treatments, and medications; (2) to learn about healthcare providers; (3) to report and prevent medical errors; (4) to exchange emotional support; and (5) to manage their time in the hospital. In this paper, we examine these themes and describe potential barriers to using a hospital-based peer support system. We then discuss the unique opportunities and challenges that the hospital environment presents when designing for peer support in this setting.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Seattle Children's", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Shefali Haldar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haldar:Shefali", "Sonali R.
