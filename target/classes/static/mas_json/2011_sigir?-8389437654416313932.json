{"title": "A boosting approach to improving pseudo-relevance feedback.", "fields": ["relevance feedback", "learning to rank", "boosting", "magnitude", "limiting"], "abstract": "Pseudo-relevance feedback has proven effective for improving the average retrieval performance. Unfortunately, many experiments have shown that although pseudo-relevance feedback helps many queries, it also often hurts many other queries, limiting its usefulness in real retrieval applications. Thus an important, yet difficult challenge is to improve the overall effectiveness of pseudo-relevance feedback without sacrificing the performance of individual queries too much. In this paper, we propose a novel learning algorithm, FeedbackBoost, based on the boosting framework to improve pseudo-relevance feedback through optimizing the combination of a set of basis feedback algorithms using a loss function defined to directly measure both robustness and effectiveness. FeedbackBoost can potentially accommodate many basis feedback methods as features in the model, making the proposed method a general optimization framework for pseudo-relevance feedback. As an application, we apply FeedbackBoost to improve pseudo feedback based on language models through combining different document weighting strategies. The experiment results demonstrate that FeedbackBoost can achieve better average precision and meanwhile dramatically reduce the number and magnitude of feedback failures as compared to three representative pseudo feedback methods and a standard learning to rank approach for pseudo feedback.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Wolfram Research"], "authors": ["Yuanhua Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Yuanhua", "ChengXiang Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:ChengXiang", "Wan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
