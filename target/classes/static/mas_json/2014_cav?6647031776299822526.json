{"title": "Safraless Synthesis for Epistemic Temporal Specifications.", "fields": ["implementation", "linear temporal logic", "antichain", "perfect information", "epistemic modal logic"], "abstract": "In this paper we address the synthesis problem for specifications given in linear temporal single-agent epistemic logic, KLTL (or KL 1), over single-agent systems having imperfect information of the environment state. [17] have shown that this problem is 2Exptime complete. However, their procedure relies on complex automata constructions that are notoriously resistant to efficient implementations as they use Safra-like determinization.\n\nWe propose a \"Safraless\" synthesis procedure for a large fragment of KLTL. The construction transforms first the synthesis problem into the problem of checking emptiness for universal co-Buchi tree automata using an information-set construction. Then we build a safety game that can be solved using an antichain-based symbolic technique exploiting the structure of the underlying automata. The technique is implemented and applied to a couple of case studies.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Rodica Bozianu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bozianu:Rodica", "Catalin Dima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dima:Catalin", "Emmanuel Filiot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filiot:Emmanuel"], "pages": 16}
