{"title": "Reducing access latency in erasure coded cloud storage with local block migration.", "fields": ["erasure code", "erasure", "systematic code", "cloud storage", "converged storage"], "abstract": "Erasure coding has been applied in many cloud storage systems to enhance reliability at a lower storage cost than replication. While a large amount of prior work aims to enhance recovery performance and reliability, the overall access delay in coded storage still needs to be optimized. As most production systems adopt a systematic code and place the original copy of each block on only one server to be read normally, it is harder to balance server loads and more likely to incur latency tails in coded storage than in three-way replication, where a block can be read from any of the 3 servers storing the block. In this paper, we propose to reduce the access latency in coded storage systems by moving blocks with anti-correlated demands onto same servers for statistical load balancing. We formulate the optimal block placement as a problem similar to Min-k-Partition, propose a local block migration scheme, and derive an approximation ratio as a function of demand variation across blocks. Based on request traces from Windows Azure Storage, we demonstrate that our scheme can significantly reduce the access latency with only a few block moves, especially when the request demand is skewed.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Yaochen Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yaochen", "Di Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Di"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
