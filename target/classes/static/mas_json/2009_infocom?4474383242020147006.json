We impose the LTE MIMO constraint of selecting only one MIMO mode (spatial multiplexing or transmit diversity) per user per transmission time interval (TTI). First, we address the optimal MIMO mode selection (multiplexing or diversity) per user in each TTI in order to maximize the proportional fair (PF) criterion extended to frequency and spatial domains. We prove that the SU-MIMO (single-user MIMO) FDPS problem under the LTE requirement is NP-hard and therefore, we develop two approximation algorithms (one with full channel feedback and the other with partial channel feedback) with provable performance bounds. Based on 3GPP LTE system model simulations, the approximation algorithm with partial channel feedback is shown to have comparable performance to the one with full channel feedback, while significantly reducing the channel feedback overhead by nearly 50%.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Suk-Bok Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Suk=Bok", "Sayantan Choudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhury:Sayantan", "Ahmad Khoshnevis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khoshnevis:Ahmad", "Shugong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Shugong", "Songwu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Songwu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
