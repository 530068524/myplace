In this paper, soft real-time sporadic task systems are considered that include self-suspending tasks. Conditions are presented for guaranteeing bounded deadline tardiness in such systems under global EDF or FIFO multiprocessor scheduling. These conditions enable many soft real-time task systems with self-suspending tasks to be scheduled with little or no utilization loss.", "citation": "Citations (38)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Cong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Cong", "James H.
