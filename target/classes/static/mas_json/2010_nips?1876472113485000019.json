The permutation complexity is based (like the maximum discrepancy) on dependent sampling. We prove a uniform bound on the generalization error, as well as a concentration result which means that the permutation estimate can be efficiently estimated.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "authors": ["Malik Magdon-Ismail.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magdon=Ismail:Malik"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
