By tuning to the light emitted from indoor fluorescent lamps, FLIGHT can intelligently extract the light period information and achieve network wide time calibration by referring to such a common time reference. We address a series of practical challenges and implement FLIGHT in TelosB motes. We conduct comprehensive experiments using a 12-node test-bed in both static and mobile environments. Over one-week measurement suggests that compared with existing technologies, FLIGHT can achieve tightly synchronized time with low energy consumption.", "citation": "Citations (40)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Zhenjiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhenjiang", "Wenwei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wenwei", "Cheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Cheng", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
