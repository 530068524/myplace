{"title": "Stable user-defined priorities.", "fields": ["convergence", "scheduling", "throughput", "scalability", "network performance"], "abstract": "Network providers now want to enable users to define their own flow priorities, and commercial devices already implement this ability. However, it has been shown that directly applying arbitrary user-defined priorities can fundamentally destabilize a network. In this paper, we show that it is possible to apply user-defined priorities while keeping the network stable. We introduce U-BP, a scalable approach that extends backpressure-based scheduling techniques to service user-defined flow priorities and rates while maintaining throughput optimality and strong network performance. We explain how our approach relies on a dual-layer scheme with an exponential convergence to requested priorities. We further prove analytically the network stability of our solution, and show how it achieves a strong performance for high-priority flows.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Shay Vargaftik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vargaftik:Shay", "Isaac Keslassy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keslassy:Isaac", "Ariel Orda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orda:Ariel"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
