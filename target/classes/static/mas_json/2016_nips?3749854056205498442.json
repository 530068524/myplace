In general terms, two main approaches have been developed: one based on penalized regularization methods, and one based on trimming functions. In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of a variant of the classical quadratic k-means algorithm, the robust k-means, which borrows ideas from outlier detection in regression. We show that two outliers in a dataset are enough to breakdown this clustering procedure. However, if we focus on \u201cwell-structured\u201d datasets, then robust k-means can recover the underlying cluster structure in spite of the outliers. Finally, we show that, with slight modifications, the most general non-asymptotic results for consistency of quadratic k-means remain valid for this robust variant.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": [], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alexandros Georgogiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Georgogiannis:Alexandros"], "pages": 9}
