{"title": "On the Impossibility of Three-Move Blind Signature Schemes.", "fields": ["blind signature", "random oracle", "impossibility", "mathematical proof", "blindness"], "abstract": "We investigate the possibility to prove security of the well-known blind signature schemes by Chaum, and by Pointcheval and Stern in the standard model, i.e., without random oracles. We subsume these schemes under a more general class of blind signature schemes and show that finding security proofs for these schemes via black-box reductions in the standard model is hard. Technically, our result deploys meta-reduction techniques showing that black-box reductions for such schemes could be turned into efficient solvers for hard non-interactive cryptographic problems like RSA or discrete-log. Our approach yields significantly stronger impossibility results than previous meta-reductions in other settings by playing off the two security requirements of the blind signatures (unforgeability and blindness).", "citation": "Citations (51)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Marc Fischlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischlin:Marc", "Dominique Schr\u00f6der.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schr=ouml=der:Dominique"], "pages": 19}
