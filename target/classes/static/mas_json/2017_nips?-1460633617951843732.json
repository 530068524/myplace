It opens the door to large-scale statistical models. Finding a unified perspective for all available data calls for scalable and automated solutions to an old challenge: how to aggregate heterogeneous information on brain function into a universal cognitive system that relates mental operations/cognitive processes/psychological tasks to brain networks? We cast this challenge in a machine-learning approach to predict conditions from statistical brain maps across different studies. For this, we leverage multi-task learning and multi-scale dimension reduction to learn low-dimensional representations of brain images that carry cognitive information and can be robustly associated with psychological stimuli. Our multi-dataset classification model achieves the best prediction performance on several large reference datasets, compared to models without cognitive-aware low-dimension representations; it brings a substantial performance boost to the analysis of small datasets, and can be introspected to identify universal template cognitive concepts.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "RWTH Aachen University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Thoth, LJK", "PARIETAL, NEUROSPIN"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Arthur Mensch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mensch:Arthur", "Julien Mairal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mairal:Julien", "Danilo Bzdok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bzdok:Danilo", "Bertrand Thirion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thirion:Bertrand", "Ga\u00ebl Varoquaux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varoquaux:Ga=euml=l"], "pages": 11}
