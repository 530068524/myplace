{"title": "Optimizing the F-Measure in Multi-Label Classification: Plug-in Rule Approach versus Structured Loss Minimization.", "fields": ["multinomial logistic regression", "multi label classification", "inference", "plug in", "structured support vector machine"], "abstract": "We compare the plug-in rule approach for optimizing the F\u03b2-measure in multilabel classification with an approach based on structured loss minimization, such as the structured support vector machine (SSVM). Whereas the former derives an optimal prediction from a probabilistic model in a separate inference step, the latter seeks to optimize the F\u03b2-measure directly during the training phase. We introduce a novel plug-in rule algorithm that estimates all parameters required for a Bayes-optimal prediction via a set of multinomial regression models, and we compare this algorithm with SSVMs in terms of computational complexity and statistical consistency. As a main theoretical result, we show that our plug-in rule algorithm is consistent, whereas the SSVM approaches are not. Finally, we present results of a large experimental study showing the benefits of the introduced algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["Pozna\u0144 University of Technology", "Pozna\u0144 University of Technology", "Pozna\u0144 University of Technology", "University of Marburg", "NGDATA-Europe,  ... 0 Gent, Belgium"], "authors": ["Krzysztof Dembczynski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dembczynski:Krzysztof", "Arkadiusz Jachnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jachnik:Arkadiusz", "Wojciech Kotlowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotlowski:Wojciech", "Willem Waegeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waegeman:Willem", "Eyke H\u00fcllermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=uuml=llermeier:Eyke"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
