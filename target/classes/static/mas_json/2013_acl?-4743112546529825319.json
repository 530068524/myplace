{"title": "Graph-based Local Coherence Modeling.", "fields": ["graph", "coherence", "grid", "readability", "sentence"], "abstract": "We propose a computationally efficient graph-based approach for local coherence modeling. We evaluate our system on three tasks: sentence ordering, summary coherence rating and readability assessment. The performance is comparable to entity grid based approaches though these rely on a computationally expensive training phase and face data sparsity problems.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Camille Guinaudeau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guinaudeau:Camille", "Michael Strube.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strube_0001:Michael"], "pages": 11}
