Applying this technique to ubiquitous user interfaces, it is possible to detect the 3D-position of multiple human hands in different configurations above a surface that is equipped with a small number of sensors. The retrieved object configurations can significantly improve a user's interaction experience or an application's execution context, for example by detecting multi-hand zoom and rotation gestures or recognizing a grasping hand. We emphasize the broad applicability of the proposed method with a study of a multi-hand gesture recognition device.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society"], "authors": ["Tobias Alexander Gro\u00dfe-Puppendahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gro=szlig=e=Puppendahl:Tobias_Alexander", "Andreas Braun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braun_0001:Andreas", "Felix Kamieth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamieth:Felix", "Arjan Kuijper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuijper:Arjan"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
