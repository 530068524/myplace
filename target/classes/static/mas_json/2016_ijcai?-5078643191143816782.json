{"title": "A Clause Tableau Calculus for MaxSAT.", "fields": ["multiset", "discrete mathematics", "completeness", "maximum satisfiability problem", "soundness"], "abstract": "We define a clause tableau calculus for MaxSAT, prove its soundness and completeness, and describe a tableau-based algorithm for MaxSAT. Given a multiset of clauses \u03d5, the algorithm computes both the minimum number of clauses that can be falsified in \u03d5, and an optimal assignment. We also describe how the algorithm can be extended to solve weighted MaxSAT and weighted partial MaxSAT.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Chu Min Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chu_Min", "Felip Many\u00e0.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Many=agrave=:Felip", "Joan Ramon Soler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soler:Joan_Ramon"], "pages": 7}
