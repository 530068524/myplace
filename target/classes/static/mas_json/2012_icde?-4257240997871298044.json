{"title": "Horton: Online Query Execution Engine for Large Distributed Graphs.", "fields": ["query optimization", "component based software engineering", "query language", "regular language", "server"], "abstract": "Graphs are used in many large-scale applications, such as social networking. The management of these graphs poses new challenges as such graphs are too large for a single server to manage efficiently. Current distributed techniques such as map-reduce and Pregel are not well-suited to processing interactive ad-hoc queries against large graphs. In this paper we demonstrate Horton, a distributed interactive query execution engine for large graphs. Horton defines a query language that allows the expression of regular language reach ability queries and provides a query execution engine with a query optimizer that allows interactive execution of queries on large distributed graphs in parallel. In the demo, we show the functionality of Horton managing a large graph for a social networking application called Codebook, whose graph represents data on software components, developers, development artifacts such as bug reports, and their interactions in large software projects.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Mohamed Sarwat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarwat:Mohamed", "Sameh Elnikety.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elnikety:Sameh", "Yuxiong He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yuxiong", "Gabriel Kliot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kliot:Gabriel"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
