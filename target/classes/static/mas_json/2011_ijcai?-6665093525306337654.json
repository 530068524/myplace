This paper studies the importance of domain knowledge in story generation, and particularly in analogy-based story generation (ASG). Based on the construct of knowledge container in case-based reasoning, we present a theoretical framework for incorporating domain knowledge in ASG. We complement the framework with empirical results in our existing system Riu.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Spanish National Research Council", "University of Central Florida"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Santiago Onta\u00f1\u00f3n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onta=ntilde==oacute=n:Santiago", "Jichen Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jichen"], "pages": 6}
