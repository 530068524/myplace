We develop the mathematical foundation for the approach based on an iterative selection of the most appropriate task, learning the task parameters, and updating the shared knowledge, optimizing a new bi-convex loss function. This proposed method applies quite generally, including to multitask feature learning, multitask learning with alternating structure optimization and multitask manifold regularization learning. Results show that in each of the above formulations self-paced (easier-to-harder) task selection outperforms the baseline version of these methods in all the experiments.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Keerthiram Murugesan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murugesan:Keerthiram", "Jaime G.
