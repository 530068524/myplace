Yet we know little of how flight attendants collaborate and whether or not technology adequately supports their practices. Through an interview study with flight attendants, we explored their collaborative practices and processes and how technology aided such practices. While technologies like interphones and flight attendant call buttons acted as collaboration tools, we identified instances where the usability and functionality of these devices were the main barriers for maintaining efficient communication, situation awareness, and information exchange. Our findings inform the design of future technologies for enhancing communication and collaboration in an aircraft setting amongst flight attendants with an emphasis on real time information access and direct communication between flight attendants regardless of their location.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Stephanie Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Stephanie", "Carman Neustaedter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neustaedter:Carman"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
