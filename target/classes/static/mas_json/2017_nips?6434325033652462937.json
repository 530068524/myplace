{"title": "Adversarial Ranking for Language Generation.", "fields": ["binary classification", "restrict", "discriminator", "reference group", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have great successes on synthesizing data. However, the existing GANs restrict the discriminator to be a binary classifier, and thus limit their learning capacity for tasks that need to synthesize output with rich structures such as natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network, RankGAN, for generating high-quality language descriptions. Rather than training the discriminator to learn and assign absolute binary predicate for individual data sample, the proposed RankGAN is able to analyze and rank a collection of human-written and machine-written sentences by giving a reference group. By viewing a set of data samples collectively and evaluating their quality through relative ranking scores, the discriminator is able to make better assessment which in turn helps to learn a better generator. The proposed RankGAN is optimized through the policy gradient technique. Experimental results on multiple public datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kevin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Kevin", "Dianqi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dianqi", "Xiaodong He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaodong", "Ming-Ting Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Ming=Ting", "Zhengyou Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhengyou"], "pages": 11}
