We demonstrate in this paper that the function mapping underlying the device can be tractably learned based on input and output spike train data alone. We begin by posing the problem in a classification based framework. We then derive a novel kernel for an SRM0 model that is based on PSP and AHP like functions. With the kernel we demonstrate how the learning problem can be posed as a Quadratic Program. Experimental results demonstrate the strength of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Nicholas Fisher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fisher:Nicholas", "Arunava Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Arunava"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
