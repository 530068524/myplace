{"title": "6-DOF VR videos with a single 360-camera.", "fields": ["image warping", "headset", "immersion", "headphones", "frame rate"], "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in consumer level virtual reality (VR) headsets are creating a growing user-base in demand for immersive, full 3D VR experiences. While monoscopic 360-videos are perhaps the most prevalent type of content for VR headsets, they lack 3D information and thus cannot be viewed with full 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF). We present an approach that addresses this limitation via a novel warping algorithm that can synthesize new views both with rotational and translational motion of the viewpoint. This enables the ability to perform VR playback of input monoscopic 360-videos files in full stereo with full 6-DOF of head motion. Our method synthesizes novel views for each eye in accordance with the 6-DOF motion of the headset. Our solution tailors standard structure-from-motion and dense reconstruction algorithms to work accurately for 360-videos and is optimized for GPUs to achieve VR frame rates (>120 fps). We demonstrate the effectiveness our approach on a variety of videos with interesting content.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems"], "authors": ["Jingwei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jingwei", "Zhili Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhili", "Duygu Ceylan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceylan:Duygu", "Hailin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Hailin"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
