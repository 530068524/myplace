{"title": "An adaptive speed-call list algorithm and its evaluation with ESM.", "fields": ["call management", "self organizing list", "simulation", "experience sampling method", "computer science", "mobile phone", "list update problem"], "abstract": "We designed an algorithm to build a speed-call list adaptively based on mobile phone call logs. Call logs provide the time-dependent calling patterns of mobile phone users, and therefore a speed-call list based on them will be more successful in recommending a desired number than a speed-call list based on recent calls only. This paper presents the design process of our algorithm for an adaptive speed-call list, its verification result with recorded call logs, and in-situ evaluation results of the algorithm using an Experience Sampling Method (ESM) system.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Seunghwan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Seunghwan", "Jungsuk Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Jungsuk", "Geehyuk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Geehyuk"], "pages": 4}
