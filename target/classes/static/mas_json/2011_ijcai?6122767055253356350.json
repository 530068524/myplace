{"title": "A Uniform Approach for Generating Proofs and Strategies for Both True and False QBF Formulas.", "fields": ["correctness", "solver", "mathematical proof", "computation", "falsity"], "abstract": "Many important problems can be compactly represented as quantified boolean formulas (QBF) and solved by general QBF solvers. To date QBF solvers have mainly focused on determining whether or not the input QBF is true or false. However, additional important information about an application can be gathered from its QBF formulation. In this paper we demonstrate that a circuitbased QBF solver can be exploited to obtain a QResolution proof of the truth or the falsity of a QBF. QBFs have a natural interpretation as a two person game and our main result is to show how, via a simple computation, the moves for the winning player can be computed directly from these proofs. This result shows that the proof is a representation of the winning strategy. In previous approaches the winning strategy has often been represented in a way that makes it hard to verify. In our approach the correctness of the strategy follows directly from the correctness of the proof, which is relatively easy to verify.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Alexandra Goultiaeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goultiaeva:Alexandra", "Allen Van Gelder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gelder:Allen_Van", "Fahiem Bacchus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bacchus:Fahiem"], "pages": 8}
