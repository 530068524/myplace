{"title": "An Evaluation of Strict Timestamp Ordering Concurrency Control for Main-Memory Database Systems.", "fields": ["timestamp based concurrency control", "isolation", "optimistic concurrency control", "non lock concurrency control", "multiversion concurrency control"], "abstract": "With the fundamental change of hardware technology, main-memory database systems have emerged as the next generation of DBMS. Thus, new methods to execute transactions in a serial, lock-free mode have been investigated and successfully employed, for instance in H-Store or HyPer. Although these techniques allow for unprecedentedly high throughput for suitable workloads, their throughput quickly diminishes once unsuitable transactions, for instance those crossing partition borders, are encountered. Still, little research concentrates on the overdue re-evaluation of traditional techniques, that do not rely on partitioning.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Stephan Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Stephan", "Henrik M\u00fche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=he:Henrik", "Alfons Kemper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kemper:Alfons", "Thomas Neumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumann_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
