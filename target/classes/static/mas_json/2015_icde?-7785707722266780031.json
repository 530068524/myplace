{"title": "Quick-motif: An efficient and scalable framework for exact motif discovery.", "fields": ["subsequence", "motif", "computation", "scalability", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Discovering motifs in sequence databases has been receiving abundant attentions from both database and data mining communities, where the motif is the most correlated pair of subsequences in a sequence object. Motif discovery is expensive for emerging applications which may have very long sequences (e.g., million observations per sequence) or the queries arrive rapidly (e.g., per 10 seconds). Prior works cannot offer fast correlation computations and prune subsequence pairs at the same time, as these two techniques require different orderings on examining subsequence pairs. In this work, we propose a novel framework named Quick-Motif which adopts a two-level approach to enable batch pruning at the outer level and enable fast correlation calculation at the inner level. We further propose two optimization techniques for the outer and the inner level. In our experimental study, our method is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Macau", "University of Macau", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "University of Macau"], "authors": ["Yuhong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuhong", "Leong Hou U.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/U:Leong_Hou", "Man Lung Yiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yiu:Man_Lung", "Zhiguo Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Zhiguo"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
