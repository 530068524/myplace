Each Level-Up unit is a self-contained device worn like a boot. Its main functional element is a vertical actuation mechanism mounted to the bottom of the boot that extends vertically. Unlike traditional solutions that are integrated with locomotion devices, Level-Ups allow users to walk around freely (\"real-walking\"). We present Level-Ups in a demo environment based on a head-mounted display, optical motion capture, and integrated with two different game engines. In a user study, participants rated the realism of stepping onto objects 6.0 out of 7.0 when wearing Level-Ups compared to 3.5 without.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dominik Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Dominik", "Robert Kovacs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kovacs:Robert", "Vikram Mehta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehta:Vikram", "Udayan Umapathi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Umapathi:Udayan", "Sven K\u00f6hler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=hler_0004:Sven", "Lung-Pan Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Lung=Pan", "Patrick Baudisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baudisch:Patrick"], "pages": 4}
