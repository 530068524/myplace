The typical setting of traditional active learning methods is querying labels from an oracle. This is only possible if an expert exists, which may not be the case in many real world applications. In this paper, we focus on designing easier questions that can be answered by a non-expert. These questions poll relative information as opposed to absolute information and can be even generated from sideinformation. We propose an active learning approach that queries the ordering of the importance of an instance's neighbors rather than its label. We explore our approach on real datasets and make several interesting discoveries including that querying neighborhood information can be an effective question to ask and sometimes can even yield better performance than querying labels.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "IBM", "IBM", "Arizona State University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Buyue Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Buyue", "Xiang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Xiang", "Fei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Fei", "Hongfei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongfei", "Jieping Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jieping", "Ian Davidson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davidson:Ian"], "pages": 7}
