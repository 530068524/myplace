This paper studies shortest distance computing in the cloud, which aims at the following goals: i) preventing outsourced graphs from neighborhood attack, ii) preserving shortest distances in outsourced graphs, iii) minimizing overhead on the client side. The basic idea of this paper is to transform an original graph G into a link graph Gl kept locally and a set of outsourced graphs Go. Each outsourced graph should meet the requirement of a new security model called 1-neighborhood-d-radius. In addition, the shortest distance query can be answered using Gl and Go. Our objective is to minimize the space cost on the client side when both security and utility requirements are satisfied. We devise a greedy method to produce Gl and Go, which can exactly answer the shortest distance queries. We also develop an efficient transformation method to support approximate shortest distance answering under a given additive error bound. The final experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Peking University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Kent State University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jun", "Jeffrey Xu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jeffrey_Xu", "Ruoming Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Ruoming", "Jiashuai Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Jiashuai", "Tengjiao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Tengjiao", "Dongqing Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Dongqing"], "pages": 12}
