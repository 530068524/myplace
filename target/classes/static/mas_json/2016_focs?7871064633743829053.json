This proves a recent conjecture of Steinhardt, Valiant and Wager [15] and shows that for some learning problems a large storage space is crucial. More formally, in the problem of parity learning, an unknown string x e {0,1}n was chosen uniformly at random. A learner tries to learn x from a stream of samples (a1, b1), (a2, b2)\u2026, where each at is uniformly distributed over {0,1}n and bt is the inner product of at and x, modulo 2. We show that any algorithm for parity learning, that uses less than n2/25 bits of memory, requires an exponential number of samples. Previously, there was no non-trivial lower bound on the number of samples needed, for any learning problem, even if the allowed memory size is O(n) (where n is the space needed to store one sample). We also give an application of our result in the field of bounded-storage cryptography. We show an encryption scheme that requires a private key of length n, as well as time complexity of n per encryption/decryption of each bit, and is provenly and unconditionally secure as long as the attacker uses less than n2/25 memory bits and the scheme is used at most an exponential number of times. Previous works on bounded-storage cryptography assumed that the memory size used by the attacker is at most linear in the time needed for encryption/decryption.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Ran Raz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raz:Ran"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
