{"title": "Exploring Seasonality in Mobile Cultural Heritage.", "fields": ["cultural heritage", "recreation", "mixed reality", "cultural history", "cultural heritage management"], "abstract": "We present results of an investigation into the role of seasonality in mobile cultural heritage applications. 45 participants in 26 groups used one of two applications when visiting the Finnish recreational island of Seurasaari. Each provided summer and winter content, but varied in how this was presented. We uncovered how users consider seasonality in content, seasonal preferences, as well as how different media becomes more or less interesting if shown in or out of season. We present design considerations for future researchers to consider seasonality in cultural heritage applications.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Aalto University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David K.
