However, they often deliver unsatisfactory overall processing efficiency compared with shared-memory graph computing frameworks. We analyze the behavior of several graph-parallel systems and find that the added overhead for achieving scalability becomes a major limiting factor for efficiency, especially with modern multi-core processors and high-speed interconnection networks.\n\nBased on our observations, we present Gemini, a distributed graph processing system that applies multiple optimizations targeting computation performance to build scalability on top of efficiency. Gemini adopts (1) a sparse-dense signal-slot abstraction to extend the hybrid push-pull computation model from shared-memory to distributed scenarios, (2) a chunk-based partitioning scheme enabling low-overhead scaling out designs and locality-preserving vertex accesses, (3) a dual representation scheme to compress accesses to vertex indices, (4) NUMA-aware sub-partitioning for efficient intra-node memory accesses, plus (5) locality-aware chunking and fine-grained work-stealing for improving both internode and intra-node load balance, respectively. Our evaluation on an 8-node high-performance cluster (using five widely used graph applications and five real-world graphs) shows that Gemini significantly outperforms all well-known existing distributed graph processing systems, delivering up to 39.8\u00d7 (from 8.91\u00d7) improvement over the fastest among them.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Xiaowei Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaowei", "Wenguang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wenguang", "Weimin Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Weimin", "Xiaosong Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiaosong"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2016", "pages": 16}
