Although gap phenomena in EDM are very complicated and hence not yet very well understood, recent improvements in computers and electronic measuring instruments are contributing to new discoveries and inventions in EDM technology. Such newly acquired insight sometimes raises questions on the validity of the established theories of EDM phenomena, and EDM processes once believed to be impossible or unrealistic are now becoming practical.", "citation": "Citations (627)", "departments": ["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of St. Gallen", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Paris", "Maastricht University", "University of Milan", "Wageningen University and Research Centre", "University of Edinburgh", "Iowa State University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Case Western Reserve University", "University of Oxford", "National Institutes of Health", "Imperial College London", "University of Washington", "University of Oxford", "Mechanical & Ma ... als Engineering"], "authors": ["Jody Ghani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghani:Jody"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
