{"title": "A Hybrid Grammar-Based Approach for Learning and Recognizing Natural Hand Gestures.", "fields": ["adaptive grammar", "formalism", "gesture", "stochastic grammar", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a hybrid grammar formalism designed to learn structured models of natural iconic gesture performances that allow for compressed representation and robust recognition. We analyze a dataset of iconic gestures and show how the proposed Featurebased Stochastic Context-Free Grammar (FSCFG) can generalize over both structural and feature-based variations among different gesture performances.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Bielefeld University", "Bielefeld University"], "authors": ["Amir Sadeghipour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadeghipour:Amir", "Stefan Kopp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopp:Stefan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
