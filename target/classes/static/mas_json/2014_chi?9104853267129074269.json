Using simple, low-resolution capacitive touch sensors placed around a standard phone, we outline a machine learning approach to modelling the grip modulation and inferring front-of-screen touch targets. We experimentally demonstrate that grip is a remarkably good predictor of touch, and we can predict touch position 200ms before contact with an accuracy of 18mm.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Kuala Lumpur", "University of Glasgow", "BlackRock", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mohammad Faizuddin Mohd Noor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noor:Mohammad_Faizuddin_Mohd", "Andrew Ramsay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramsay:Andrew", "Stephen Hughes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hughes:Stephen", "Simon Rogers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogers:Simon", "John Williamson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williamson:John", "Roderick Murray-Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murray=Smith:Roderick"], "pages": 4}
