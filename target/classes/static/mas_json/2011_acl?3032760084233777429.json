The basic idea is that the hidden states of FHMMs are an explicit short-term memory with an antecedent buffer containing recently described referents. Thus an observed pronoun can find its antecedent from the hidden buffer, or in terms of a generative model, the entries in the hidden buffer generate the corresponding pronouns. A system implementing this model is evaluated on the ACE corpus with promising performance.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee", "Ohio State University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Dingcheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dingcheng", "Timothy A.
