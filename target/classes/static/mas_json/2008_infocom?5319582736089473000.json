The basis of our study is a 402-day trace of over 7 billion Internet intrusion attempts provided by DShield.org, which includes 160 million unique source addresses. Specifically, we focus on spatial distributions and temporal characteristics of malicious sources. First, we find that one out of 27 hosts is potentially a scanning source among 2 32  IPv4 addresses. We then show that malicious sources have a persistent, non-uniform spatial distribution. That is, more than 80% of the sources send packets from the same 20% of the IPv4 address space over time. We also find that 7.3% of malicious source addresses are unroutable, and that some source addresses are correlated. Next, we show that most sources have a short lifetime. 57.9 % of the source addresses appear only once in the trace, and 90% of source addresses appear less than 5 times. These results have implications for both attacks and defenses.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["University of Miami", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Zesheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zesheng", "Chuanyi Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Chuanyi", "Paul Barford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barford:Paul"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
