{"title": "A Threat for Tablet PCs in Public Space: Remote Visualization of Screen Images Using EM Emanation.", "fields": ["visualization", "touchscreen", "profiling", "countermeasure", "input device"], "abstract": "The use of tablet PCs is spreading rapidly, and accordingly users browsing and inputting personal information in public spaces can often be seen by third parties. Unlike conventional mobile phones and notebook PCs equipped with distinct input devices (e.g., keyboards), tablet PCs have touchscreen keyboards for data input. Such integration of display and input device increases the potential for harm when the display is captured by malicious attackers. This paper presents the description of reconstructing tablet PC displays via measurement of electromagnetic (EM) emanation. In conventional studies, such EM display capture has been achieved by using non-portable setups. Those studies also assumed that a large amount of time was available in advance of capture to obtain the electrical parameters of the target display. In contrast, this paper demonstrates that such EM display capture is feasible in real time by a setup that fits in an attache case. The screen image reconstruction is achieved by performing a prior course profiling and a complemental signal processing instead of the conventional fine parameter tuning. Such complemental processing can eliminate the differences of leakage parameters among individuals and therefore correct the distortions of images. The attack distance, 2 m, makes this method a practical threat to general tablet PCs in public places. This paper discusses possible attack scenarios based on the setup described above. In addition, we describe a mechanism of EM emanation from tablet PCs and a countermeasure against such EM display capture.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Tohoku University", "Tohoku University", "Tohoku University", "Tohoku University", "Tohoku University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Yu-ichi Hayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayashi:Yu=ichi", "Naofumi Homma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Homma:Naofumi", "Mamoru Miura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miura:Mamoru", "Takafumi Aoki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aoki:Takafumi", "Hideaki Sone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sone:Hideaki"], "pages": 12}
