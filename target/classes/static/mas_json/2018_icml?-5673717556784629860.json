{"title": "Augmented CycleGAN: Learning Many-to-Many Mappings from Unpaired Data.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "machine learning", "image segmentation", "many to many", "structured prediction"], "abstract": "Learning inter-domain mappings from unpaired data can improve performance in structured prediction tasks, such as image segmentation, by reducing the need for paired data. CycleGAN was recently proposed for this problem, but critically assumes the underlying inter-domain mapping is approximately deterministic and one-to-one. This assumption renders the model ineffective for tasks requiring flexible, many-to-many mappings. We propose a new model, called Augmented CycleGAN, which learns many-to-many mappings between domains. We examine Augmented CycleGAN qualitatively and quantitatively on several image datasets.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Amjad Almahairi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Almahairi:Amjad", "Sai Rajeshwar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajeshwar:Sai", "Alessandro Sordoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sordoni:Alessandro", "Philip Bachman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bachman:Philip", "Aaron C.
