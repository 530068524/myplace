{"title": "Stage framework: an HTML5 and CSS3 framework for digital publishing.", "fields": ["scrolling", "swipe", "electronic publishing", "web standards", "html5"], "abstract": "In this paper we present Stage Framework, an HTML5 and CSS3 framework for digital book, magazine and newspaper publishing. The framework offers publishers the means and tools for publishing editorial content in the HTML5 format using a single web application. The approach is cross-platform and is based on open web standards. Stage Framework serves as an alternative for platform-specific native publications using pure HTML5 to deliver book, magazine and newspaper content while retaining the familiar gesture interaction of native applications. Available gesture actions include for example the page swipe and kinetic scrolling. The magazine browsing view relies entirely on CSS3 3D Transforms and Transitions, thus utilizing hardware acceleration in most devices and platforms. The web application also features a magazine stand which, can be used to offer issues of multiple publications. Developed as a part of master's thesis research, the framework has been published under the GPL and MIT licenses and is available to everyone via the framework website (http://stageframework.com) and the GitHub repository (http://github.com/ralatalo/stage).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Aalto University"], "authors": ["Rami Aamulehto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aamulehto:Rami", "Mikko Kuhna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhna:Mikko", "Jussi Tarvainen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarvainen:Jussi", "Pirkko Oittinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oittinen:Pirkko"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
