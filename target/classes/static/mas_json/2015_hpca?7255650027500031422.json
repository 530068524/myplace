{"title": "Malware-aware processors: A framework for efficient online malware detection.", "fields": ["implementation", "exploit", "field programmable gate array", "malware", "software"], "abstract": "Security exploits and ensuant malware pose an increasing challenge to computing systems as the variety and complexity of attacks continue to increase. In response, software-based malware detection tools have grown in complexity, thus making it computationally difficult to use them to protect systems in real-time. Therefore, software detectors are applied selectively and at a low frequency, creating opportunities for malware to remain undetected. In this paper, we propose Malware-Aware Processors (MAP) \u2014 processors augmented with an online hardware-based detector to serve as the first line of defense to differentiate malware from legitimate programs. The output of this detector helps the system prioritize how to apply more expensive software-based solutions. The always-on nature of MAP detector helps protect against intermittently operating malware. Our work improves on the state of the art in the following ways: (1) We define and explore the use of sub-semantic features for online detection of malware. (2) We explore hardware implementations and show that simple classifiers appropriate for such implementations can effectively classify malware. We also study different classifiers, develop implementation optimizations, and explore complexity to performance trade-offs. (3) We propose a two-level detection framework where the hardware classifier prioritizes the work of a more accurate but more expensive software defense mechanism. (4) We integrate the MAP implementation with an open-source x86-compatible core, synthesizing the resulting design to run on an FPGA.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Binghamton University", "Binghamton University", "Binghamton University", "University of California, Riverside", "Binghamton University"], "authors": ["Meltem Ozsoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ozsoy:Meltem", "Caleb Donovick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Donovick:Caleb", "Iakov Gorelik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorelik:Iakov", "Nael B.
