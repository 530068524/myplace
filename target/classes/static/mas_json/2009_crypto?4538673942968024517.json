We define a notion of differential q -multicollision and show that for AES-256 q-multicollisions can be constructed in time q\u00b7267 and with negligible memory, while we prove that the same task for an ideal cipher of the same block size would require at least $O(q\\cdot 2^{\\frac{q-1}{q+1}128})$ time. Using similar approach and with the same complexity we can also construct q-pseudo collisions for AES-256 in Davies-Meyer mode, a scheme which is provably secure in the ideal-cipher model. We have also computed partial q-multicollisions in time q\u00b7237 on a PC to verify our results. These results show that AES-256 can not model an ideal cipher in theoretical constructions. Finally we extend our results to find the first publicly known attack on the full 14-round AES-256: a related-key distinguisher which works for one out of every 235 keys with 2120 data and time complexity and negligible memory. This distinguisher is translated into a key-recovery attack with total complexity of 2131 time and 265 memory.", "citation": "Citations (318)", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Alex Biryukov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biryukov:Alex", "Dmitry Khovratovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khovratovich:Dmitry", "Ivica Nikolic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikolic:Ivica"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2009", "pages": 19}
