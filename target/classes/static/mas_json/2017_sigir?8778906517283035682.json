In this paper, we study influence maximization from a game perspective. We propose a Coordination Game model, in which every individuals make their decisions based on the benefit of coordination with their network neighbors, to study information propagation. Our model serves as the generalization of some existing models, such as Majority Vote model and Linear Threshold model. Under the generalized model, we study the hardness of influence maximization and the approximation guarantee of the greedy algorithm. We also combine several strategies to accelerate the algorithm. Experimental results show that after the acceleration, our algorithm significantly outperforms other heuristics, and it is three orders of magnitude faster than the original greedy method.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Yu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yu", "Yan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
