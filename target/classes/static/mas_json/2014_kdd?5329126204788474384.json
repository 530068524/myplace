In this paper, we propose a prototype-based classification model for evolving data streams, called SyncStream, which dynamically models time-changing concepts and makes predictions in a local fashion. Instead of learning a single model on a sliding window or ensemble learning, SyncStream captures evolving concepts by dynamically maintaining a set of prototypes in a new data structure called the P-tree. The prototypes are obtained by error-driven representativeness learning and synchronization-inspired constrained clustering. To identify abrupt concept drift in data streams, PCA and statistics based heuristic approaches are employed. SyncStream has several attractive benefits: (a) It is capable of dynamically modeling evolving concepts from even a small set of prototypes and is robust against noisy examples. (b) Owing to synchronization-based constrained clustering and the P-Tree, it supports an efficient and effective data representation and maintenance. (c) Gradual and abrupt concept drift can be effectively detected. Empirical results shows that our method achieves good predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms and that it requires much less time than another instance-based stream mining algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Mainz", "University of Mainz"], "authors": ["Junming Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Junming", "Zahra Ahmadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmadi:Zahra", "Stefan Kramer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kramer_0001:Stefan"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
