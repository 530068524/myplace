Therefore, such methods cannot be easily applied on noisy sequences expected in real-world applications. In this paper, we present the Temporal Attention-Gated Model (TAGM) which integrates ideas from attention models and gated recurrent networks to better deal with noisy or unsegmented sequences. Specifically, we extend the concept of attention model to measure the relevance of each observation (time step) of a sequence. We then use a novel gated recurrent network to learn the hidden representation for the final prediction. An important advantage of our approach is interpretability since the temporal attention weights provide a meaningful value for the salience of each time step in the sequence. We demonstrate the merits of our TAGM approach, both for prediction accuracy and interpretability, on three different tasks: spoken digit recognition, text-based sentiment analysis and visual event recognition.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Delft University of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wenjie Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Wenjie", "Tadas Baltrusaitis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baltrusaitis:Tadas", "David M.
