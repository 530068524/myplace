We propose a new criterion for measuring the value of information, which values information that leads to robust decisions (i.e., ones that are unlikely to change due to new information). We also introduce an algorithm for Naive Bayes networks that selects features with maximal VOI under the new criterion. We discuss the application of the new criterion to classification tasks, showing how it can be used to tradeoff the budget, allotted for acquiring information, with the classification accuracy. In particular, we show empirically that the new criterion can reduce the expended budget significantly while reducing the classification accuracy only slightly. We also show empirically that the new criterion leads to decisions that are much more robust than those based on traditional VOI criteria, such as information gain and classification loss. This make the new criterion particularly suitable for certain decision making applications.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Suming Jeremiah Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Suming_Jeremiah", "Arthur Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Arthur", "Adnan Darwiche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darwiche:Adnan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
