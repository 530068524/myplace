By taking a conceptually new approach, we are able to use a more  digitally -friendly communication channel to construct protocols that achieve a stronger collusion-free property.\n\nWe consider a communication channel which can filter and rerandomize message traffic. We then provide a new security definition that captures collusion-freeness in this new setting; our new setting even allows for the mediator to be corrupted in which case the security gracefully fails to providing standard privacy and correctness. This stronger notion makes the property useful in more settings.\n\nTo illustrate feasibility, we construct a commitment scheme and a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge that meet our definition in its two variations.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["New York University", "University of Virginia", "University of Salerno"], "authors": ["Jo\u00ebl Alwen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alwen:Jo=euml=l", "Abhi Shelat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shelat:Abhi", "Ivan Visconti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Visconti:Ivan"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 18}
