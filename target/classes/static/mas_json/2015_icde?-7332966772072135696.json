However, a growing number of today's database applications are characterized by self-descriptive data. The schema of self-descriptive data is very dynamic and prone to frequent changes; a situation which is always troublesome to handle in relational systems. This demo presents the relational database management system FRDM. With flexible relational tables FRDM greatly simplifies the management of self-descriptive data in a relational database system. Self-descriptive data can reside directly next to traditionally modeled data and both can be queried together using SQL. This demo presents the various features of FRDM and provides first-hand experience of the newly gained freedom in relational database systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Hannes Voigt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voigt:Hannes", "Patrick Damme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damme:Patrick", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
