Here we propose a generative probabilistic framework using a reinforced Poisson process to explicitly model the process through which individual items gain their popularity. This model distinguishes itself from existing models via its capability of modeling the arrival process of popularity and its remarkable power at predicting the popularity of individual items. It possesses the flexibility of applying Bayesian treatment to further improve the predictive power using a conjugate prior. Extensive experiments on a longitudinal citation dataset demonstrate that this model consistently outperforms existing popularity prediction methods.", "citation": "Citations (126)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "IBM", "University of Miami", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Hua-Wei Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Hua=Wei", "Dashun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Dashun", "Chaoming Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Chaoming", "Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barab=aacute=si:Albert=L=aacute=szl=oacute="], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
