{"title": "On Separability of Loss Functions, and Revisiting Discriminative Vs Generative Models.", "fields": ["exponential family", "generative grammar", "discriminative model", "generative model", "estimation theory"], "abstract": "We revisit the classical analysis of generative vs discriminative models for general exponential families, and high-dimensional settings. Towards this, we develop novel technical machinery, including a notion of separability of general loss functions, which allow us to provide a general framework to obtain l\u221e convergence rates for general M-estimators. We use this machinery to analyze l\u221e and l2 convergence rates of generative and discriminative models, and provide insights into their nuanced behaviors in high-dimensions. Our results are also applicable to differential parameter estimation, where the quantity of interest is the difference between generative model parameters.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Adarsh Prasad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prasad:Adarsh", "Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niculescu=Mizil:Alexandru", "Pradeep Ravikumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravikumar:Pradeep"], "pages": 10}
