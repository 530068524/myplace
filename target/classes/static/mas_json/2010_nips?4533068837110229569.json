Our relaxation is derived from reducing the MAP assignment problem to an instance of a recently proposed Bipartite Multi-cut problem where the LP relaxation is guaranteed to provide an O(log k) approximation where k is the number of vertices adjacent to non-submodular edges in the MRF. We then propose a combinatorial algorithm to efficiently solve the LP and also provide a lower bound by concurrently solving its dual to within an e approximation. The algorithm is up to an order of magnitude faster and provides better MAP scores and bounds than the state of the art message passing algorithm of [1] that tightens the local marginal polytope with third-order marginal constraints.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "authors": ["Sashank Jakkam Reddi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reddi:Sashank_Jakkam", "Sunita Sarawagi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarawagi:Sunita", "Sundar Vishwanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vishwanathan:Sundar"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
