{"title": "A Simple and Strongly-Local Flow-Based Method for Cut Improvement.", "fields": ["strength of a graph", "graph bandwidth", "cut", "graph cuts in computer vision", "mixed graph"], "abstract": "Many graph-based learning problems can be cast as finding a good set of vertices nearby a seed set, and a powerful methodology for these problems is based on maximum flows. We introduce and analyze a new method for locally-biased graph-based learning called SimpleLocal, which finds good conductance cuts near a set of seed vertices. An important feature of our algorithm is that it is strongly-local, meaning it does not need to explore the entire graph to find cuts that are locally optimal. This method solves the same objective as existing strongly-local flow-based methods, but it enables a simple implementation. We also show how it achieves localization through an implicit l1-norm penalty term. As a flow-based method, our algorithm exhibits several advantages in terms of cut optimality and accurate identification of target regions in a graph. We demonstrate the power of SimpleLocal by solving problems on a 467 million edge graph based on an MRI scan.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Nate Veldt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veldt:Nate", "David F.
