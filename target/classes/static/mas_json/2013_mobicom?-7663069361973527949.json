Typically, interference alignment is achieved by having a MIMO sender precode its transmission to align it at the receiver. In this paper, we show, for the first time, that interference alignment can be achieved via motion, and works even for single-antenna transmitters. Specifically, this alignment can be achieved purely by sliding the receiver's antenna. Interestingly, the amount of antenna displacement is of the order of one inch which makes it practical to incorporate into recent sliding antennas available on the market. We implemented our design on USRPs and demonstrated that it can deliver 1.98\u00d7 throughput gains over 802.11n in networks with both single-antenna and multi- antenna nodes.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Washington", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Fadel Adib.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adib:Fadel", "Swarun Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Swarun", "Omid Aryan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aryan:Omid", "Shyamnath Gollakota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollakota:Shyamnath", "Dina Katabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katabi:Dina"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
