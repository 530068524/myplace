Our algorithm, which we call Procrustes Flow, starts from an initial estimate obtained by a thresholding scheme followed by gradient descent on a non-convex objective. We show that as long as the measurements obey a standard restricted isometry property, our algorithm converges to the unknown matrix at a geometric rate. In the case of Gaussian measurements, such convergence occurs for a n1 \u00d7 n2 matrix of rank r when the number of measurements exceeds a constant times (n1 + n2)r.", "citation": "Citations (152)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Ming Hsieh Depa ... os Angeles, CA"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Stephen Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Stephen", "Ross Boczar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boczar:Ross", "Max Simchowitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simchowitz:Max", "Mahdi Soltanolkotabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soltanolkotabi:Mahdi", "Ben Recht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Recht:Ben"], "pages": 10}
