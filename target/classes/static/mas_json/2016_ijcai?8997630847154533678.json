As a preliminary attempt to take up this challenge, we focus on multiple-choice questions in Gaokao, and propose a three-stage approach that exploits and extends information retrieval techniques. Taking Wikipedia as the source of knowledge, our approach obtains knowledge relevant to a question by retrieving pages from Wikipedia via string matching and context-based disambiguation, and then ranks and filters pages using multiple strategies to draw critical evidence, based on which the truth of each option is assessed via relevance-based entailment. It achieves encouraging results on real-life questions in recent history tests, significantly outperforming baseline approaches.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Gong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Gong", "Weixi Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Weixi", "Ziwei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ziwei", "Jianghui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jianghui", "Yuzhong Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Yuzhong"], "pages": 7}
