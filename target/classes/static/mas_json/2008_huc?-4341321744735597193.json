Most of us are familiar with appliances for buying and validating tickets, purchasing soft drinks or getting the newspaper. We book tables in restaurants and hire cars using hotel lobby kiosks. Unfortunately, many such systems confuse and annoy their users. Thus, information technology design for the public space poses distinct challenges. Yet, it is relatively unmapped within our field. Based on an ethnographic study of the purchase and validation of ticketless travel for an airport train, this paper shows how such systems need an extended framework of usability principles, which goes beyond well-known interaction design guidelines.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["\u00d8stfold University College", "Mamut ASA, Oslo"], "authors": ["Steinar Kristoffersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kristoffersen:Steinar", "Ingunn Bratteberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bratteberg:Ingunn"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
