Sketching provides a natural modality to interact with text, and sound is an effective modality for distinguishing text. However, limited research has been conducted in this area. Our system uses a dynamic time- warping approach to recognize 26 hand-sketched characters (A-Z) solely through their acoustic signal. Our initial prototype system is user-dependent and relies on fixed stroke ordering. Our algorithm relied mainly on two features: mean amplitude and MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients). Our results showed over 80% recognition accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Wenzhe Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenzhe", "Tracy Anne Hammond.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hammond:Tracy_Anne"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
