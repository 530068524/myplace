In this paper, we consider constrained clustering with pairwise constraints, which specify some pairs of objects from the same cluster or not. The main idea is to design a kernel to respect both the proximity structure of the data and the given pairwise constraints. We propose a spectral kernel learning framework and formulate it as a convex quadratic program, which can be optimally solved efficiently. Our framework enjoys several desirable features: 1) it is applicable to multi-class problems; 2) it can handle both must-link and cannot-link constraints; 3) it can propagate pairwise constraints effectively; 4) it is scalable to large-scale problems; and 5) it can handle weighted pairwise constraints. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Zhenguo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhenguo", "Jianzhuang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jianzhuang"], "pages": 7}
