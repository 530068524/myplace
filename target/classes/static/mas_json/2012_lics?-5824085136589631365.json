{"title": "Constructing Fully Complete Models for Multiplicative Linear Logic.", "fields": ["multiplicative function", "tensor", "tensor calculus", "zeroth order logic", "linear logic"], "abstract": "We demonstrate how the Hyland-Tan double glueing construction produces a fully complete model of the unit-free multiplicative fragment of Linear Logic when applied to any of a large family of degenerative ones. This process explains as special cases a number of such models which appear in the literature. In order to achieve this result, we make use of a tensor calculus for compact closed categories with finite biproducts. We show how the combinatorial properties required for a fully complete model are obtained by the construction adding to those already available from the original category.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Manchester", "University of Manchester"], "authors": ["Andrea Schalk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schalk:Andrea", "Hugh P.
