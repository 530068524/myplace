{"title": "Designing Game-Based Myoelectric Prosthesis Training.", "fields": ["medical equipment", "prosthesis", "iterative and incremental development", "input device", "simulation"], "abstract": "A myoelectric prosthesis (myo) is a dexterous artificial limb controlled by muscle contractions. Learning to use a myo can be challenging, so extensive training is often required to use a myo prosthesis effectively. Signal visualizations and simple muscle-controlled games are currently used to help patients train their muscles, but are boring and frustrating. Furthermore, current training systems require expensive medical equipment and clinician oversight, restricting training to infrequent clinical visits. To address these limitations, we developed a new game that promotes fun and success, and shows the viability of a low-cost myoelectric input device. We adapted a user-centered design (UCD) process to receive feedback from patients, clinicians, and family members as we iteratively addressed challenges to improve our game. Through this work, we introduce a free and open myo training game, provide new information about the design of myo training games, and reflect on an adapted UCD process for the practical iterative development of therapeutic games.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of New Brunswick", "University of New Brunswick", "University of New Brunswick", "University of Dundee", "University of Lincoln"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Aaron Tabor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tabor:Aaron", "Scott Bateman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bateman:Scott", "Erik Scheme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scheme:Erik", "David R.
