{"title": "SwiPIN: Fast and Secure PIN-Entry on Smartphones.", "fields": ["authentication", "input method", "shoulder surfing", "mobile device", "gesture"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present SwiPIN, a novel authentication system that allows input of traditional PINs using simple touch gestures like up or down and makes it secure against human observers. We present two user studies which evaluated different designs of SwiPIN and compared it against traditional PIN. The results show that SwiPIN performs adequately fast (3.7 s) to serve as an alternative input method for risky situations. Furthermore, SwiPIN is easy to use, significantly more secure against shoulder surfing attacks and switching between PIN and SwiPIN feels natural.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Emanuel von Zezschwitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zezschwitz:Emanuel_von", "Alexander De Luca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luca:Alexander_De", "Bruno Brunkow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brunkow:Bruno", "Heinrich Hussmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hussmann:Heinrich"], "pages": 4}
