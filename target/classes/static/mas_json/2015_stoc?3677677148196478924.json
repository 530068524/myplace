We give a deterministic approximation algorithm for this problem which achieves an approximation ratio of e j/2 + o(j) . The problem is known to be NP-hard to approximate within a factor of c j  for some constant c > 1. Our algorithm also gives a factor e j + o(j)  approximation for the problem of finding the principal j x j submatrix of a rank d positive semidefinite matrix with the largest determinant. We achieve our approximation by rounding solutions to a generalization of the D-optimal design problem, or, equivalently, the dual of an appropriate smallest enclosing ellipsoid problem. Our arguments give a short and simple proof of a restricted invertibility principle for determinants.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Aleksandar Nikolov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikolov:Aleksandar"], "pages": 10}
