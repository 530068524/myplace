{"title": "Soft-Constraints to Reduce Legacy and Performance Bias to Elicit Whole-body Gestures with Low Arm Fatigue.", "fields": ["computer science", "gesture", "input device", "simulation"], "abstract": "Participant biases can influence proposed gestures in elicitation studies. There is a legacy bias from previous experience with, or even knowledge of, existing input devices, interfaces, and technologies. There is also a performance bias, where the artificial study setting does not encourage consideration of long-term aspects such as fatigue. These biases make it especially difficult to uncover gestures appropriate for whole-body gestural input. We propose using soft constraints to correct for legacy and performance biases by penalizing physical movements. We use wrist weights as a soft constraint to elicit whole-body gestures with low arm fatigue. We show soft constraints encourage a wider range of gestures using subtler arm movements or alternate body parts and lower consumed endurance for arm movements.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Colorado State University", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jaime Ruiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruiz:Jaime", "Daniel Vogel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogel_0001:Daniel"], "pages": 4}
