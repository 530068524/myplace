In our study, participants observed a virtual environment where a virtual human (VH) walked toward the participants and paced back and forth within their social space. We compared three conditions as follows: participants in the \u201cSound\u201d condition heard the footsteps of the VH; participants in the \u201cVibration\u201d condition experienced the vibration of the footsteps along with the sounds; while participants in the \u201cMute\u201d condition were not exposed to sound nor vibrotactile feedback. We found that the participants in the \u201cVibration\u201d condition felt a higher social presence with the VH compared to those who did not feel the vibration. The participants in the \u201cVibration\u201d condition also exhibited greater avoidance behavior while facing the VH and when the VH invaded their personal space.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "authors": ["Myungho Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Myungho", "Gerd Bruder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruder:Gerd", "Gregory F.
