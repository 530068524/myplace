{"title": "Challenge for Manga Processing: Sketch-based Manga Retrieval.", "fields": ["image retrieval", "sliding window protocol", "sketch", "feature", "visual word"], "abstract": "We propose a sketch-based system for manga image retrieval. In the system, users simply draw sketches, and similar images are retrieved in real time from a manga database. The results are updated every time the user draws a stroke and therefore users can intuitively interact with the system. The proposed method consists of a simple and efficient sliding window-based feature description framework and interactive re-ranking schemes, which are introduced because the characteristics of manga images are different from those of naturalistic images, and thus, traditional image retrieval methods are not effective. Additionally, the future directions of improving the current retrieval system, including by using a combination of text features and image features, and the construction of a large database are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Yusuke Matsui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsui:Yusuke"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
