Our method exploits prior knowledge in the form of a sparse graph representing the expected spatial positions of tumor classes. Such information is coupled with image-based classification techniques along with spatial smoothness constraints towards producing a reliable detection map within a unified graphical model formulation. Towards optimal use of prior knowledge, a two layer interconnected graph is considered with one layer corresponding to the low-grade glioma type (characterization) and the second layer to voxel-based decisions of tumor presence. Efficient linear programming both in terms of performance as well as in terms of computational load is considered to recover the lowest potential of the objective function. The outcome of the method refers to both tumor segmentation as well as their characterization. Promising results on substantial data sets demonstrate the extreme potentials of our method.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "D\u00e9partement de  ... pellier, France", "Intrasense SAS, ... pellier, France"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sarah Parisot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parisot:Sarah", "Hugues Duffau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duffau:Hugues", "St\u00e9phane Chemouny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chemouny:St=eacute=phane", "Nikos Paragios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paragios:Nikos"], "pages": 8}
