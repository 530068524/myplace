This paper proposes to model the shape of a single trajectory as a sequence of angles described using a mixture of Von Mises (MoVM) distribution. A complete EM (expectation maximization) algorithm is derived for MoVM parameters estimation and an on-line version proposed to meet real time requirement. Maximum-A-Posteriori is used to encode the trajectory as a sequence of symbols corresponding to the MoVM components. Iterative k-medoids clustering groups trajectories in a variable number of similarity classes. The similarity is computed aligning (with dynamic programming) two sequences and considering as symbol-to-symbol distance the Bhattacharyya distance between von Mises distributions. Extensive experiments have been performed on both synthetic and real data.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "Di.S.M.I., Reggio Emilia"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Andrea Prati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prati_0001:Andrea", "Simone Calderara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calderara:Simone", "Rita Cucchiara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cucchiara:Rita"], "pages": -1}
