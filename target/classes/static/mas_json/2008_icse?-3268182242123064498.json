{"title": "The effect of program and model structure on mc/dc test adequacy coverage.", "fields": ["critical system", "model based design", "avionics", "software metric", "source code"], "abstract": "In avionics and other critical systems domains, adequacy of test suites is currently measured using the MC/DC metric on source code (or on a model in model-based development). We believe that the rigor of the MC/DC metric is highly sensitive to the structure of the implementation and can therefore be misleading as a test adequacy criterion. We investigate this hypothesis by empirically studying the effect of program structure on MC/DC coverage.   To perform this investigation, we use six realistic systems from the civil avionics domain and two toy examples. For each of these systems, we use two versions of their implementation-with and without expression folding (i.e., inlining). To assess the sensitivity of MC/DC to program structure, we first generate test suites that satisfy MC/DC over a non-inlined implementation. We then run the generated test suites over the inlined implementation and measure MC/DC achieved. For our realistic examples, the test suites yield an average reduction of 29.5% in MC/DC achieved over the inlined implementations at 5% statistical significance level.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "Rockwell Collins", "University of Minnesota", "School of Informatics"], "authors": ["Ajitha Rajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajan:Ajitha", "Michael W.
