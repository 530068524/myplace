Indirect cursor control via a smartwatch has not been previously investigated for AR HMDs. We evaluate these two techniques for carrying out three fundamental user interface actions: target acquisition, goal crossing, and circular steering. We find that in-air is faster than smartwatch (p < 0.001) for target acquisition and circular steering. We observe, however, that in-air selection can lead to discomfort after extended use and suggest that smartwatch control offers a complementary alternative.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Dennis Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Dennis", "John J.
