The DCUBE system implements the approach of [5], which is based on classification rule extraction and analysis, by centering the analysis phase around an Oracle database. The proposed demonstration guides the audience through the legal issues about discrimination hidden in data, and through several legally-grounded analyses to unveil discriminatory situations. The SIGMOD attendees will freely pose complex discrimination analysis queries over the database of extracted classification rules, once they are presented with the database relational schema, a few ad-hoc functions and procedures, and several snippets of SQL queries for discrimination discovery.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Pisa", "University of Pisa", "University of Pisa"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Salvatore Ruggieri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruggieri:Salvatore", "Dino Pedreschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedreschi:Dino", "Franco Turini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turini:Franco"], "pages": 4}
