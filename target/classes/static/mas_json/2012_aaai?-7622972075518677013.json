A primary difficulty of marginal-MAP problems lies in the non-commutativity of the sum and max operations, so that even in highly structured models, marginalization may produce a densely connected graph over the variables to be maximized, resulting in an intractable potential function with exponential size. We propose a chain decomposition approach for summing over the marginalized variables, in which we produce a structured approximation to the MAP component of the problem consisting of only pairwise potentials. We show that this approach is equivalent to the maximization of a specific variational free energy, and it provides an upper bound of the optimal probability. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our method performs favorably compared to previous methods.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Qiang Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Qiang", "Feng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0007:Feng", "Jianwu Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jianwu", "Wenli Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Wenli", "Alexander T.
