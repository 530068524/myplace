These top 10 algorithms are among the most influential data mining algorithms in the research community. With each algorithm, we provide a description of the algorithm, discuss the impact of the algorithm, and review current and further research on the algorithm. These 10 algorithms cover classification,", "citation": "Citations (4,140)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Vermont", "University of Minnesota", "University of Texas at Austin", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Indian Institute of Science", "University of Cambridge", "Indian Institute of Science", "University of Cambridge", "Indian Institute of Science", "London School of Economics and Political Science", "Paris School of Economics", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Tennessee", "United States Department of Energy", "Rulequest Resea ...
