The algorithms significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional search based techniques exploiting both static and dynamic analysis. The combined approach yields a 54% increase in branch coverage and a 30% reduction in test effort. Each improvement is separately evaluated in an empirical study on 6 real world web applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Nadia Alshahwan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alshahwan:Nadia", "Mark Harman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harman:Mark"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
