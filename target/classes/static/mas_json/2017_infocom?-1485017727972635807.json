The routing behaviors can be quite complex with increasing network scale and environmental dynamics. Knowledge on the routing path of each packet is certainly a great help in understanding the complex routing behaviors, allowing effective performance diagnosis and efficient network management. We propose PAT, a universal sensornet path tracing approach. PAT includes an intelligent path encoding scheme that allows efficient decoding at the PC side. To make PAT more scalable, we propose techniques to accurately estimate the degree information by exploiting timing information, allowing more compact path encoding. Moreover, we employ subpath concatenation to infer excessively long paths with a high recovery probability. We carefully evaluate PAT's performance using testbed experiments and and extensive simulations with up to 4,000 nodes. Results show that PAT significantly outperforms existing approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Yi Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yi", "Wei Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong_0001:Wei", "Xiaoyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiaoyu", "Wenbin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Wenbin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
