This encoding uses a constant sized alphabet. This improves on an earlier result of Schulman, who showed how to recover when the fraction of errors is bounded by 1/240. We also show how to simulate an arbitrary protocol with a protocol using the binary alphabet, a constant factor increase in communication and tolerating a (1/8-e) fraction of errors.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Washington"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Mark Braverman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braverman:Mark", "Anup Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Anup"], "pages": 8}
