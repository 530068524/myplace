A fundamental integral equation relating the instantaneous flow rate and the window dynamics is derived. Properties of the model, such as well-posedness and stability, are investigated. Packet level experiments verify that this new model is more accurate than existing models, correctly predicting qualitatively different behaviors, for example when round trip delays are heterogeneous.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "Cornell University", "California Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Krister Jacobsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobsson:Krister", "Lachlan L.
