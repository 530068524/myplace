{"title": "New classes of distributed time complexity.", "fields": ["graph", "binary logarithm", "time complexity", "neighbourhood", "rational number"], "abstract": "A number of recent papers \u2013 e.g. Brandt et al. (STOC 2016), Chang et al. (FOCS 2016), Ghaffari & Su (SODA 2017), Brandt et al. (PODC 2017), and Chang & Pettie (FOCS 2017) \u2013 have advanced our understanding of one of the most fundamental questions in theory of distributed computing: what are the possible time complexity classes of LCL problems in the LOCAL model? In essence, we have a graph problem \u03a0 in which a solution can be  verified  by checking all radius- O (1) neighbourhoods, and the question is what is the smallest  T  such that a solution can be  computed  so that each node chooses its own output based on its radius- T  neighbourhood. Here  T  is the distributed time complexity of \u03a0. The time complexity classes for deterministic algorithms in bounded-degree graphs that are known to exist by prior work are \u0398(1), \u0398(log *   n ), \u0398(log n ), \u0398( n  1/ k  ), and \u0398( n ). It is also known that there are two gaps: one between \u03c9(1) and  o (loglog *   n ), and another between \u03c9(log *   n ) and  o (log n ). It has been conjectured that many more gaps exist, and that the overall time hierarchy is relatively simple \u2013 indeed, this is known to be the case in restricted graph families such as cycles and grids. We show that the picture is much more diverse than previously expected. We present a general technique for engineering LCL problems with numerous different deterministic time complexities, including \u0398(log \u03b1   n ) for any \u03b1 \u2265 1, 2 \u0398(log \u03b1   n )  for any \u03b1 \u2264 1, and \u0398( n  \u03b1 ) for any \u03b1  \u03b1  log *   n ) for any \u03b1 \u2265 1, 2 \u0398(log \u03b1  log *   n )  for any \u03b1 \u2264 1, and \u0398((log *   n ) \u03b1 ) for any \u03b1 \u2264 1 in the low end of the complexity spectrum; here \u03b1 is a positive rational number.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Aalto University", "University of Freiburg", "Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Aalto University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Alkida Balliu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balliu:Alkida", "Juho Hirvonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirvonen:Juho", "Janne H.
