We give model-theoretic criteria and prove that this problem is undecidable for conjunctive queries (CQs) but decidable in 2EXPTIME for unions of rooted CQs. We also consider the problem whether two ALC TBoxes give the same answers to any query in a given vocabulary over all ABoxes, and show that for CQs this problem is undecidable, too, but becomes decidable and 2EXPTIME-complete in Horn-ALC, and even EXPTIME-complete in Horn-ALC when restricted to (unions of) rooted CQs.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "University of Bremen", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "University of Liverpool", "Birkbeck, University of London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Elena Botoeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Botoeva:Elena", "Carsten Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutz:Carsten", "Vladislav Ryzhikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryzhikov:Vladislav", "Frank Wolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolter:Frank", "Michael Zakharyaschev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zakharyaschev:Michael"], "pages": 7}
