{"title": "Scalable Person Re-identification: A Benchmark.", "fields": ["ground truth", "computer vision", "viper", "scalability", "machine learning"], "abstract": "This paper contributes a new high quality dataset for person re-identification, named \"Market-1501\". Generally, current datasets: 1) are limited in scale, 2) consist of hand-drawn bboxes, which are unavailable under realistic settings, 3) have only one ground truth and one query image for each identity (close environment). To tackle these problems, the proposed Market-1501 dataset is featured in three aspects. First, it contains over 32,000 annotated bboxes, plus a distractor set of over 500K images, making it the largest person re-id dataset to date. Second, images in Market-1501 dataset are produced using the Deformable Part Model (DPM) as pedestrian detector. Third, our dataset is collected in an open system, where each identity has multiple images under each camera. As a minor contribution, inspired by recent advances in large-scale image search, this paper proposes an unsupervised Bag-of-Words descriptor. We view person re-identification as a special task of image search. In experiment, we show that the proposed descriptor yields competitive accuracy on VIPeR, CUHK03, and Market-1501 datasets, and is scalable on the large-scale 500k dataset.", "citation": "Citations (462)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at San Antonio", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Liang Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0001:Liang", "Liyue Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Liyue", "Lu Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Lu", "Shengjin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shengjin", "Jingdong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingdong", "Qi Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Qi"], "pages": 9}
