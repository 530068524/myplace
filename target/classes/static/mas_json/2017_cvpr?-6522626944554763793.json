{"title": "Asynchronous Temporal Fields for Action Recognition.", "fields": ["data point", "hidden markov model", "inference", "semantics", "asynchronous communication"], "abstract": "Actions are more than just movements and trajectories: we cook to eat and we hold a cup to drink from it. A thorough understanding of videos requires going beyond appearance modeling and necessitates reasoning about the sequence of activities, as well as the higher-level constructs such as intentions. But how do we model and reason about these? We propose a fully-connected temporal CRF model for reasoning over various aspects of activities that includes objects, actions, and intentions, where the potentials are predicted by a deep network. End-to-end training of such structured models is a challenging endeavor: For inference and learning we need to construct mini-batches consisting of whole videos, leading to mini-batches with only a few videos. This causes high-correlation between data points leading to breakdown of the backprop algorithm. To address this challenge, we present an asynchronous variational inference method that allows efficient end-to-end training. Our method achieves a classification mAP of 22.4% on the Charades [42] benchmark, outperforming the state-of-the-art (17.2% mAP), and offers equal gains on the task of temporal localization.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Gunnar A.
