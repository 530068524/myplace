{"title": "Modular Systems with Preferences.", "fields": ["formalism", "rotation formalisms in three dimensions", "knowledge base", "modular design", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We propose a versatile framework for combining knowledge bases in modular systems with preferences. In our formalism, each module (knowledge base) can be specified in a different language. We define the notion of a preference-based modular system that includes a formalization of metapreferences. We prove that our formalism is robust in the sense that the operations for combining modules preserve the notion of a preference-based modular system. Finally, we formally demonstrate correspondences between our framework and the related preference formalisms of cp-nets and preference-based planning. Our framework allows one to use these preference formalisms (and others) in combination, in the same modular system.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Alireza Ensan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ensan:Alireza", "Eugenia Ternovska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Ternovska:Eugenia"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
