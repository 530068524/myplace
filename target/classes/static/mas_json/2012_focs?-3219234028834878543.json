Given a finite field $\\F_q$ and an extension field $\\F_{q^n}$, a property is a set of functions mapping $\\F_{q^n}$ to $\\F_q$. The property is said to be affine-invariant if it is invariant under affine transformations of $\\F_{q^n}$, and it is said to be sparse if its size is polynomial in the domain size. Our work completes a line of work initiated by Grigorescu et al. [RANDOM 2009] and followed by Kaufman and Lovett [FOCS 2011]. The latter showed such a result for the case when $q$ was prime. Extending to non-prime cases turns out to be non-trivial and our proof involves some detours into additive combinatorics, as well as a new calculus for building property testers for affine-invariant linear properties.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Microsoft", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Microsoft"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Eli Ben-Sasson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Sasson:Eli", "Noga Ron-Zewi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ron=Zewi:Noga", "Madhu Sudan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sudan:Madhu"], "pages": 10}
