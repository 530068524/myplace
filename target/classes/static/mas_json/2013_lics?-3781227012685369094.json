{"title": "Name-Passing Calculi: From Fusions to Preorders and Types.", "fields": ["type theory", "equivalence", "expressivity", "process calculus", "subtyping"], "abstract": "The fusion calculi are a simplification of the pi-calculus in which input and output are symmetric and restriction is the only binder. We highlight a major difference between these calculi and the pi-calculus from the point of view of types, proving some impossibility results for sub typing in fusion calculi. We propose a modification of fusion calculi in which the name equivalences produced by fusions are replaced by name preorders, and with a distinction between positive and negative occurrences of names. The resulting calculus allows us to import subtype systems, and related results, from the pi-calculus. We examine the consequences of the modification on behavioural equivalence (e.g., context-free characterisations of barbed congruence) and expressiveness (e.g., full abstraction of the embedding of the asynchronous pi-calculus).", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "University of Bologna"], "authors": ["Daniel Hirschkoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirschkoff:Daniel", "Jean-Marie Madiot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madiot:Jean=Marie", "Davide Sangiorgi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sangiorgi:Davide"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
