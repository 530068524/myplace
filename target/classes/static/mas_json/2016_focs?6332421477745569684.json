{"title": "Local Search Yields Approximation Schemes for k-Means and k-Median in Euclidean and Minor-Free Metrics.", "fields": ["metric dimension", "1 planar graph", "chordal graph", "planar graph", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We give the first polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTASs) for the following problems: (1) uniform facility location in edge-weighted planar graphs, (2) k-median and k-means in edge-weighted planar graphs, (3) k-means in Euclidean space of bounded dimension. Our first and second results extend to minor-closed families of graphs. All our results extend to cost functions that are the pth power of the shortest-path distance. The algorithm is local search where the local neighborhood of a solution S consists of all solutions obtained from S by removing and adding 1/eO(1) centers.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Brown University", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Vincent Cohen-Addad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen=Addad:Vincent", "Philip N.
