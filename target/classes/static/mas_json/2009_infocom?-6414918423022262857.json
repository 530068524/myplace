In the case that GSR fails to find a solution satisfying the budget constraint, the incurred cost does not exceed the budget by a constant factor. Through extensive evaluation, we show that in all our test cases GSR always generates a topology above 95% of the optimal in terms of the number of covered users while never exceeding the budget by more than 15%.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Chun-cheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chun=cheng", "Chandra Chekuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chekuri:Chandra", "D.
