We propose a general approach to accelerate search-based program synthesis by biasing the search towards likely programs. Our approach targets a standard formulation, syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS), by extending the grammar of possible programs with a probabilistic model dictating the likelihood of each program. We develop a weighted search algorithm to efficiently enumerate programs in order of their likelihood. We also propose a method based on transfer learning that enables to effectively learn a powerful model, called probabilistic higher-order grammar, from known solutions in a domain. We have implemented our approach in a tool called Euphony and evaluate it on SyGuS benchmark problems from a variety of domains. We show that Euphony can learn good models using easily obtainable solutions, and achieves significant performance gains over existing general-purpose as well as domain-specific synthesizers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Woosuk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Woosuk", "Kihong Heo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heo:Kihong", "Rajeev Alur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alur:Rajeev", "Mayur Naik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naik:Mayur"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2018", "pages": 14}
