{"title": "Control of Fair Division.", "fields": ["ordinal number", "fair division", "small number", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We initiate the study of control actions in fair division problems where a benevolent or malicious central organizer changes the structure of the fair division problem for self-interest or to benefit one, some or all agents. One motivation for such control is to improve fairness by minimally changing the problem. As a case study, we consider the problem of adding or deleting a small number of items to improve fairness. For two agents, we present polynomial-time algorithms for adding or deleting the minimum number of items to achieve ordinal envy-freeness. For three agents, we show that both problems, as well as the more basic problem of checking whether an envy-free allocation exists, are NP-complete. This closes a problem open for over five years. Our framework leads to a number of interesting directions in the area of fair division.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "University of New South Wales"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Haris Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz_0001:Haris", "Ildik\u00f3 Schlotter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schlotter:Ildik=oacute=", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "pages": 7}
