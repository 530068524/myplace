The underlying image model is a graph whose nodes correspond to a dense set of regions, and edges reflect the underlying grid structure of the image and act as springs to guarantee the geometric consistency of nearby regions during matching. A fast approximate algorithm for matching the graphs associated with two images is presented. This algorithm is used to construct a kernel appropriate for SVM-based image classification, and experiments with the Caltech 101, Caltech 256, and Scenes datasets demonstrate performance that matches or exceeds the state of the art for methods using a single type of features.", "citation": "Citations (220)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Olivier Duchenne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duchenne:Olivier", "Armand Joulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joulin:Armand", "Jean Ponce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponce:Jean"], "pages": 8}
