{"title": "Link the Head to the \"Beak\": Zero Shot Learning from Noisy Text Description at Part Precision.", "fields": ["noisy text", "machine learning", "visualization", "classifier", "noise measurement"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study learning visual classifiers from unstructured text descriptions at part precision with no training images. We propose a learning framework that is able to connect text terms to its relevant parts and suppress connections to non-visual text terms without any part-text annotations. For instance, this learning process enables terms like beak to be sparsely linked to the visual representation of parts like head, while reduces the effect of non-visual terms like migrate on classifier prediction. Images are encoded by a part-based CNN that detect bird parts and learn part-specific representation. Part-based visual classifiers are predicted from text descriptions of unseen visual classifiers to facilitate classification without training images (also known as zero-shot recognition). We performed our experiments on CUBirds 2011 dataset and improves the state-of-the-art textbased zero-shot recognition results from 34.7% to 43.6%. We also created large scale benchmarks on North American Bird Images augmented with text descriptions, where we also show that our approach outperforms existing methods. Our code, data, and models are publically available link [1].", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Facebook", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mohamed Elhoseiny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elhoseiny:Mohamed", "Yizhe Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yizhe", "Han Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Han", "Ahmed M.
