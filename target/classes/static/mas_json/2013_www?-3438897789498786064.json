{"title": "The self-feeding process: a unifying model for communication dynamics in the web.", "fields": ["generative model", "poisson distribution", "self", "ask price", "fallacy"], "abstract": "How often do individuals perform a given communication activity in the Web, such as posting comments on blogs or news? Could we have a generative model to create communication events with realistic inter-event time distributions (IEDs)? Which properties should we strive to match? Current literature has seemingly contradictory results for IED: some studies claim good fits with power laws; others with non-homogeneous Poisson processes. Given these two approaches, we ask: which is the correct one? Can we reconcile them all? We show here that, surprisingly, both approaches are correct, being corner cases of the proposed Self-Feeding Process (SFP). We show that the SFP (a) exhibits a unifying power, which generates power law tails (including the so-called \"top-concavity\" that real data exhibits), as well as short-term Poisson behavior; (b) avoids the \"i.i.d. fallacy\", which none of the prevailing models have studied before; and (c) is extremely parsimonious, requiring usually only  one , and in general,  at most two  parameters. Experiments conducted on eight large, diverse real datasets (e.g., Youtube and blog comments, e-mails, SMSs, etc) reveal that the SFP mimics their properties very well.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"], "authors": ["Pedro Olmo Stancioli Vaz de Melo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melo:Pedro_Olmo_Stancioli_Vaz_de", "Christos Faloutsos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faloutsos:Christos", "Renato Assun\u00e7\u00e3o.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Assun=ccedil==atilde=o:Renato", "Antonio Alfredo Ferreira Loureiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loureiro:Antonio_Alfredo_Ferreira"], "conf": "www", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
