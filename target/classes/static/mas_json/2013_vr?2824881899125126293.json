We will present point-light displays of real quadruped animal actions h and human mimicry of those. Human observers can distinguish the real animal actions from that of human mimicry even with short time presentation (500ms), but the accuracy decreased with inverted (upside down) presentation. Thus, sensitivity of our perception is limited to upright postures of quadruped animals.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Toyohashi University of Technology", "Toyohashi University of Technology"], "authors": ["Natsumi Isobe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isobe:Natsumi", "Michiteru Kitazaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kitazaki:Michiteru"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
