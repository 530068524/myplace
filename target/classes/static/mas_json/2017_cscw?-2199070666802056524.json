{"title": "Detailing a Spectrum of Motivational Forces Shaping Nomadic Practices.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "knowledge management", "computer supported cooperative work", "computer science", "ethnography"], "abstract": "Recent CSCW research has shown that nomadicity can be seen as a dynamic process that emerges as people engage with practices supporting them in the mobilisation of their workplace to accomplish work in and across different locations. This paper elaborates on the emergent aspects of the process by detailing a spectrum of motivational and contextual forces that surround and shape nomadic practices. The paper contributes to existing CSCW literature on nomadicity and extends it by articulating the complex intersections of motive and context that shape nomadic practices. The findings that the paper presents emerged from an ethnographic study of a group of academics and their nomadic work/life practices.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Siegen", "Sheffield Hallam University", "University of Limerick"], "authors": ["Aparecido Fabiano Pinatti de Carvalho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carvalho:Aparecido_Fabiano_Pinatti_de", "Luigina Ciolfi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciolfi:Luigina", "Breda Gray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gray:Breda"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 16}
