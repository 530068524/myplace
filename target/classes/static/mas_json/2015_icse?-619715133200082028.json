However, these tools can be difficult to smoothly integrate with each other and into the developer workflow, particularly when scaling to large codebases. We present T ricorder , a program analysis platform aimed at building a data-driven ecosystem around program analysis. We present a set of guiding principles for our program analysis tools and a scalable architecture for an analysis platform implementing these principles. We include an empirical,  in-situ  evaluation of the tool as it is used by developers across Google that shows the usefulness and impact of the platform.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Caitlin Sadowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadowski:Caitlin", "Jeffrey van Gogh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gogh:Jeffrey_van", "Ciera Jaspan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaspan:Ciera", "Emma S\u00f6derberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=ouml=derberg:Emma", "Collin Winter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winter:Collin"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
