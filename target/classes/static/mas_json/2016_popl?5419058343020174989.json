We call this the normalization barrier. The normalization barrier stems from a theorem in computability theory that says that a total universal function for the total computable functions is impossible. In this paper we break through the normalization barrier and define a self-interpreter for System F_omega, a strongly normalizing lambda-calculus. After a careful analysis of the classical theorem, we show that static type checking in F_omega can exclude the proof's diagonalization gadget, leaving open the possibility for a self-interpreter. Along with the self-interpreter, we program four other operations in F_omega, including a continuation-passing style transformation. Our operations rely on a new approach to program representation that may be useful in theorem provers and compilers.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Matt Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brown:Matt", "Jens Palsberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palsberg:Jens"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
