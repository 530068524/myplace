{"title": "Galaxy: Encouraging Data Sharing among Sources with Schema Variants.", "fields": ["data discovery", "data sharing", "star schema", "data exchange", "schema"], "abstract": "This demonstration presents Galaxy, a schema manager that facilitates easy and correct data sharing among autonomous but related, evolving data sources. Galaxy reduces heterogeneity by helping database developers identify, reuse, customize, and advertise related schema components. The central idea is that as schemata are customized, Galaxy maintains a derivation graph, and exploits it for data exchange, discovery, and multi-database query over the \"galaxy\" of related data sources. Using a set of schemata from the biomedical domain, we demonstrate how Galaxy facilitates schema and data sharing.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation"], "authors": ["Peter Mork.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mork:Peter", "Len Seligman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seligman:Len", "Arnon Rosenthal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenthal:Arnon", "Michael Morse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morse:Michael", "Chris Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Chris", "Jeffrey Hoyt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoyt:Jeffrey", "Kenneth P.
