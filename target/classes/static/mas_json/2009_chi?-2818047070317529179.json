We analyze video-mediated indexical gestures in the collaborative production of live sport on television between distributed team members. The findings demonstrate how video forms the topic, resource and product of collabora-tion: whilst it shapes the nature of the work (editing), it is simultaneously also the primary resource for supporting mutual orientation and negotiating shot transitions between remote participants (co-ordination), as well as its end prod-uct (broadcast). Our analysis of current professional activi-ties is used to develop implications for the design of future services for live collaborative video production.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Brunel University London", "Interactive Ins ... , Kista, Sweden", "Interactive Ins ... , Kista, Sweden", "Interactive Ins ... , Kista, Sweden"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mark J.
