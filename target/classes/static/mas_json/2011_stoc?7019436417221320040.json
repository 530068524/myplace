Our study encompasses the complexity of basic arithmetic operations such as computing cube-root and computing cubic-residuosity of elements of F 2 n  . Our main result is that these problems require exponential size circuits.   We also derive strong average-case versions of these results. For example, we show that no subexponential-size, constant-depth, arithmetic circuit over F 2  can correctly compute the cubic residue symbol for more than 1/3 + o(1) fraction of the elements of F 2 n  . As a corollary, we deduce a character sum bound showing that the cubic residue character over F 2 n   is uncorrelated with all degree-d n-variate F 2  polynomials (viewed as functions over F 2 n   in a natural way), provided d l n e  for some universal e > 0. Classical methods (based on van der Corput differencing and the Weil bounds) show this only for d l log(n).   Our proof revisits the classical Razborov-Smolensky method for circuit lower bounds, and executes an analogue of it in the land of univariate polynomials over F 2 n  . The tools we use come from both F 2 n   and F 2  n . In recent years, this interplay between F 2 n   and F 2  n  has played an important role in many results in pseudorandomness, property testing and coding theory.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Institute for Advanced Study"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Swastik Kopparty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopparty:Swastik"], "pages": 10}
