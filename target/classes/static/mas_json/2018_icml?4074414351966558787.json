{"title": "A Reductions Approach to Fair Classification.", "fields": ["binary classification", "data set", "pattern recognition", "classifier", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present a systematic approach for achieving fairness in a binary classification setting. While we focus on two well-known quantitative definitions of fairness, our approach encompasses many other previously studied definitions as special cases. Our approach works by reducing fair classification to a sequence of cost-sensitive classification problems, whose solutions yield a randomized classifier with the lowest (empirical) error subject to the desired constraints. We introduce two reductions that work for any representation of the cost-sensitive classifier and compare favorably to prior baselines on a variety of data sets, while overcoming several of their disadvantages.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Yahoo!", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Alekh Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Alekh", "Alina Beygelzimer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beygelzimer:Alina", "Miroslav Dud\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dud=iacute=k:Miroslav", "John Langford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langford_0001:John", "Hanna M.
