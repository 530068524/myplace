{"title": "Doppio: A Reconfigurable Dual-Face Smartwatch for Tangible Interaction.", "fields": ["exploratory research", "wearable computer", "task switching", "smartwatch", "information access"], "abstract": "Doppio is a reconfigurable smartwatch with two touch sensitive display faces. The orientation of the top relative to the base and how the top is attached to the base, creates a very large interaction space. We define and enumerate possible configurations, transitions, and manipulations in this space. Using a passive prototype, we conduct an exploratory study to probe how people might use this style of smartwatch interaction. With an instrumented prototype, we conduct a controlled experiment to evaluate the transition times between configurations and subjective preferences. We use the combined results of these two studies to generate a set of characteristics and design considerations for applying this interaction space to smartwatch applications. These considerations are illustrated with a proof-of-concept hardware prototype demonstrating how Doppio interactions can be used for notifications, private viewing, task switching, temporary information access, application launching, application modes, input, and sharing the top.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "Dartmouth College", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Teddy Seyed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seyed:Teddy", "Xing-Dong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xing=Dong", "Daniel Vogel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogel_0001:Daniel"], "pages": 12}
