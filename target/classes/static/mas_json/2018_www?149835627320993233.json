{"title": "Inferring Missing Categorical Information in Noisy and Sparse Web Markup.", "fields": ["categorical variable", "markup language", "microdata", "rdfa", "f1 score"], "abstract": "Embedded markup of Web pages has seen widespread adoption throughout the past years, driven by standards such as RDFa and Microdata and initiatives such as schema.org, where recent studies show an adoption by 38% of all Web pages already in 2016. While this constitutes a significant source of information aiding tasks such as Web search, Web page classification or knowledge graph augmentation, individual markup nodes are usually sparsely described, where essential information usually is not provided. For instance, 63% of nodes provide less than three statements/properties while from 24 million nodes describing events only 244 thousand (0.9%) provide specific event types. However, given the scale and diversity of markup data, in particular for categorical properties as in the previous example, there exist sufficiently large amounts of nodes, which provide the sought after information. These nodes constitute potential training data from which to build supervised models for inferring missing information to significantly augment sparsely described nodes. In this work, we introduce a supervised approach for inferring missing categorical properties in Web markup. Our results, conducted on properties of events and movies show a performance of 83% F1 score, outperforming existing baselines significantly.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Leibniz University of Hanover", "Leibniz University of Hanover", "Leibniz University of Hanover"], "authors": ["Nicolas Tempelmeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tempelmeier:Nicolas", "Elena Demidova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demidova:Elena", "Stefan Dietze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dietze:Stefan"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
