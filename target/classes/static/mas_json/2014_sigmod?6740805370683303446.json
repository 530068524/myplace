In this paper, we study online community search which is practically useful but less studied in the literature. Given a query vertex in a graph, the problem is to find meaningful communities that the vertex belongs to in an online manner. We propose a novel community model based on the k-truss concept, which brings nice structural and computational properties. We design a compact and elegant index structure which supports the efficient search of k-truss communities with a linear cost with respect to the community size. In addition, we investigate the k-truss community search problem in a dynamic graph setting with frequent insertions and deletions of graph vertices and edges. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our community model and search algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of Technology, Sydney", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Xin Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Xin", "Hong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Hong", "Lu Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Lu", "Wentao Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Wentao", "Jeffrey Xu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jeffrey_Xu"], "pages": 12}
