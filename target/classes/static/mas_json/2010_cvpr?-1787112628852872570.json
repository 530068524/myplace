The algorithm requires just a rough user-provided bounding box for the objects in a single-view image. On receiving the user's bounding box, it takes about 1\u20132 seconds to segment and rectify mega-pixel sized figures. The main feature of the algorithm is a novel segmentation method that exploits the properties of printed figures. Specifically, a set of boundary candidates is generated using the properties, and the optimal boundary in the set is found by using an alternating optimization scheme. This segmentation result is further refined so that it is well localized to the true boundary. In addition to our segmentation method, we also propose a new boundary interpolation method for the rectification of segmented figures. The method improves the quality of output by largely removing perspective distortions compared to conventional boundary interpolation methods. Experimental results on a variety of images show that the method is efficient, robust, and easy to use.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hyung Il Koo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koo:Hyung_Il", "Nam Ik Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Nam_Ik"], "pages": 8}
