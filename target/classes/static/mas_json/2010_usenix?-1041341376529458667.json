Since ZooKeeper is part of critical infrastructure, ZooKeeper aims to provide a simple and high performance kernel for building more complex coordination primitives at the client. It incorporates elements from group messaging, shared registers, and distributed lock services in a replicated, centralized service. The interface exposed by Zoo-Keeper has the wait-free aspects of shared registers with an event-driven mechanism similar to cache invalidations of distributed file systems to provide a simple, yet powerful coordination service.\n\nThe ZooKeeper interface enables a high-performance service implementation. In addition to the wait-free property, ZooKeeper provides a per client guarantee of FIFO execution of requests and linearizability for all requests that change the ZooKeeper state. These design decisions enable the implementation of a high performance processing pipeline with read requests being satisfied by local servers. We show for the target workloads, 2:1 to 100:1 read to write ratio, that ZooKeeper can handle tens to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. This performance allows ZooKeeper to be used extensively by client applications.", "citation": "Citations (1,362)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Patrick Hunt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hunt:Patrick", "Mahadev Konar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konar:Mahadev", "Flavio Paiva Junqueira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Junqueira:Flavio_Paiva", "Benjamin Reed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reed:Benjamin"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
