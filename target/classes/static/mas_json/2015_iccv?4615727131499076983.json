Solving this geometric reassembly problem has direct applications in archaeology and forensic investigation in the computer-aided restoration of damaged artifacts and evidence. We develop a new algorithm to effectively integrate both guidance from a template and from matching of adjacent pieces' fracture-regions. First, we compute partial matchings between fragments and a template, and pairwise matchings among fragments. Many potential matches are obtained and then selected/refined in a multi-piece matching stage to maximize global groupwise matching consistency. This pipeline is effective in composing fragmented thin-shell objects containing small pieces, whose pairwise matching is usually unreliable and ambiguous and hence their reassembly remains challenging to the existing algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Louisiana State University", "Louisiana State University", "Louisiana State University", "Louisiana State University", "Xiamen University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Kang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Kang", "Wuyi Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Wuyi", "Mary Manhein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manhein:Mary", "Warren N.
