We propose a new nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based method, in which locally reliable clusters are explicitly considered by using instance-wise weights over clusters. Our method factorizes the input cluster assignment matrix into two matrices H and W, which are optimized by iteratively 1) updating H and W while keeping the weight matrix constant and 2) updating the weight matrix while keeping H and W constant, alternatively. The weights in the second step were updated by solving a convex problem, which makes our algorithm significantly faster than existing NMF-based ensemble clustering methods. We empirically proved that our method outperformed a lot of cutting-edge ensemble clustering methods by using a variety of datasets.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Kyoto University"], "authors": ["Xiaodong Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Xiaodong", "Shanfeng Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Shanfeng", "Junning Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Junning", "Hiroshi Mamitsuka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mamitsuka:Hiroshi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
