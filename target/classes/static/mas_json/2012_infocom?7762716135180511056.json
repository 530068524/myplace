Most radio-based solutions require a process of site survey, in which radio signatures are collected and stored for further comparison and matching. Site survey involves intensive costs on manpower and time. In this work, we study unexploited RF signal characteristics and leverage user motions to construct radio floor plan that is previously obtained by site survey. On this basis, we design WILL, an indoor localization approach based on off-the-shelf WiFi infrastructure and mobile phones. WILL is deployed in a real building covering over 1600 m 2 , and its deployment is easy and rapid since site survey is no longer needed. The experiment results show that WILL achieves competitive performance comparing with traditional approaches.", "citation": "Citations (381)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Xi'an Jiao Tong ... iversity, China"], "authors": ["Chenshu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Chenshu", "Zheng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Zheng", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao", "Wei Xi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xi:Wei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
