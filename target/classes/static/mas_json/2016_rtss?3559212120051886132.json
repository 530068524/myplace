{"title": "Closing the Loop for the Selective Conversion Approach: A Utilization-Based Test for Hard Real-Time Suspending Task Systems.", "fields": ["scheduling", "metrical task system", "real time computing", "distributed computing", "computation"], "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of scheduling hard real-time sporadic suspending task systems under global earliest-deadline-first. A novel selective suspension-tocomputation conversion approach has been developed, with the fundamental idea of selecting and converting a limited set of jobs' suspensions into computation to eliminate suspension-induced pessimism in the analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this approach yields the first utilization-based test for globally-scheduled suspending task systems, which analytically dominates the suspension-oblivious approach and dramatically improves schedulability upon existing tests by over 50% on average, as shown by experiments. We believe this paper closes the loop on applying the methodology of selective suspension-to-computation conversion to analyze realtime suspending task systems.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Zheng Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Zheng", "Cong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Cong"], "pages": 12}
