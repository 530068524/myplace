Machines with 100 quantum bits (qubits) are anticipated to be operational by 2020 [30, 73], and several-hundred-qubit machines are around the corner. Machines of this scale have the capacity to demonstrate  quantum supremacy , the tipping point where QC is faster than the fastest classical alternative for a particular problem. Because error correction techniques will be central to QC and will be the most expensive component of quantum computation, choosing the lowest-overhead error correction scheme is critical to overall QC success. This paper evaluates two established quantum error correction codes---planar and double-defect surface codes---using a set of compilation, scheduling and network simulation tools. In considering scalable methods for optimizing both codes, we do so in the context of a full microarchitectural and compiler analysis. Contrary to previous predictions, we find that the simpler planar codes are sometimes more favorable for implementation on superconducting quantum computers, especially under conditions of high communication congestion.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ali JavadiAbhari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/JavadiAbhari:Ali", "Pranav Gokhale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gokhale:Pranav", "Adam Holmes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holmes:Adam", "Diana Franklin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Franklin:Diana", "Kenneth R.
