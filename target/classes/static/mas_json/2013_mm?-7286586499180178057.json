The slides content derives automatically from OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process with an approximate accuracy of 90%. Then we partition the slides into different subtopics by examining their logical relevance. Since the slides are synchronized with the video stream, the subtopics of the slides indicate exactly the segments of the video. Our evaluation reveals that the average length of segments for each lecture is ranged from 5 to 15 minutes, and 45% segments achieved from test datasets are logically reasonable.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "authors": ["Xiaoyin Che.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Che:Xiaoyin", "Haojin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Haojin", "Christoph Meinel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meinel:Christoph"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
