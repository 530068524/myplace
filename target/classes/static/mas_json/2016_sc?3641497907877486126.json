{"title": "A machine learning framework for performance coverage analysis of proxy applications.", "fields": ["procurement", "intuition", "basic linear algebra subprograms", "scalability", "unsupervised learning"], "abstract": "Proxy applications are written to represent subsets of performance behaviors of larger, and more complex applications that often have distribution restrictions. They enable easy evaluation of these behaviors across systems, e.g., for procurement or co-design purposes. However, the intended correlation between the performance behaviors of proxy applications and their parent codes is often based solely on the developer's intuition. In this paper, we present novel machine learning techniques to methodically quantify the coverage of performance behaviors of parent codes by their proxy applications. We have developed a framework, V eritas , to answer these questions in the context of on-node performance: a) which hardware resources are covered by a proxy application and how well, and b) which resources are important, but not covered. We present our techniques in the context of two benchmarks, STREAM and DGEMM, and two production applications, OpenMC and CMTnek, and their respective proxy applications.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Tanzima Zerin Islam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Islam:Tanzima_Zerin", "Jayaraman J.
