{"title": "On optimal service differentiation in congested network markets.", "fields": ["service level requirement", "service product management", "differentiated service", "service level objective", "service guarantee"], "abstract": "As Internet applications have become more diverse in recent years, users having heavy demand for online video services are more willing to pay higher prices for better services than light users that mainly use e-mails and instant messages. This encourages the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to explore service differentiations so as to optimize their profits and allocation of network resources. Much prior work has focused on the viability of network service differentiation by comparing with the case of a single-class service. However, the optimal service differentiation for an ISP subject to resource constraints has remained unsolved. In this work, we establish an optimal control framework to derive the analytical solution to an ISP's optimal service differentiation, i.e., the optimal service qualities and associated prices. By analyzing the structures of the solution, we reveal how an ISP should adjust the service qualities and prices in order to meet varying capacity constraints and users' characteristics. We also obtain the conditions under which ISPs have strong incentives to implement service differentiation and whether regulators should encourage such practices.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "National University of Singapore", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Mao Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou:Mao", "Richard T.
