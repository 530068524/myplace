The algorithm is based on simulating first arrival times in a doubly stochastic Poisson process using the thinning method, and allows efficient sampling of Bayesian posteriors in big datasets. We prove that in the BPS no bias is introduced by noisy evaluations of the log-likelihood gradient. On the other hand, we argue that efficiency considerations favor a small, controllable bias in the construction of the thinning proposals, in exchange for faster mixing. We introduce a simple regression-based proposal intensity for the thinning method that controls this trade-off. We illustrate the algorithm in several examples in which it outperforms both unbiased, but slowly mixing stochastic versions of BPS, as well as biased stochastic gradient-based samplers.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Duke University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ari Pakman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pakman:Ari", "Dar Gilboa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilboa:Dar", "David E.
