In this paper we present a user-centered programming by demonstration project for authoring interactive robotic locomotion style. The style in which a robot moves about a space, expressed through its motions, can be used for communication. For example, a robot could move aggressively in reaction to a person's actions, or alternatively react using careful, submissive movements. We present a new demonstration interface, algorithm, and evaluation results.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Manitoba", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Calgary"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["James Everett Young.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Young:James_Everett", "Kentaro Ishii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishii:Kentaro", "Takeo Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Takeo", "Ehud Sharlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharlin:Ehud"], "pages": 5}
