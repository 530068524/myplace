{"title": "Search-based Evaluation from Truth Transcripts for Voice Search Applications.", "fields": ["ground truth", "search engine", "name resolution", "voice search", "sentence"], "abstract": "Voice search applications are typically evaluated by comparing the predicted query to a reference human transcript, regardless of the search results returned by the query. While we find that an exact transcript match is highly indicative of user satisfaction, a transcript which does not match the reference still produces satisfactory search results a significant fraction of the time. This paper therefore proposes an evaluation method that compares the search results of the speech recognition hypotheses with the search results produced by a human transcript. Compared with a strict sentence match, a human evaluation shows that search result overlap is a better predictor of (a) user satisfaction and (b) search result click-through. Finally, we propose a model predicting the Expected Search Satisfaction Rate (ESSR), conditioned on search overlap outcomes. On a held out set of 1036 voice search queries, our model predicted an ESSR within 0.9% (relative) of the ground truth satisfaction averaged over 3 human judges.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Amazon.com", "Amazon.com", "Amazon.com"], "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Mairesse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mairesse:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Paul Raccuglia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raccuglia:Paul", "Shiv Vitaladevuni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitaladevuni:Shiv"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
