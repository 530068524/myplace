{"title": "Towards Multimodal Affective Feedback: Interaction between Visual and Haptic Modalities.", "fields": ["stimulus", "international affective picture system", "haptic memory", "visual perception", "modalities"], "abstract": "We explored how emotional cues presented in visual and haptic modalities interact. We constructed an affective haptic dataset, and used the emotional visual stimuli from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Participants were asked to rate the visual stimuli, haptic stimuli and visualhaptic stimuli. Analysis of the results indicates that the presence of haptic stimulus affects the arousal of the visual stimulus, but does not affect the valence significantly. We further explored this interaction in terms of the intensity, frequency, waveform and rhythm of the haptic stimuli. We then provide a set of guidelines on visual-haptic interaction that could be used in design of multimodal affective feedback.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "Samsung", "Samsung"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Akshita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akshita:", "Harini Alagarai Sampath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sampath:Harini_Alagarai", "Bipin Indurkhya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Indurkhya:Bipin", "Eunhwa Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Eunhwa", "Yudong Bae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bae:Yudong"], "pages": 10}
