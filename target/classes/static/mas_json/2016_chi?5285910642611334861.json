{"title": "Momentary Pleasure or Lasting Meaning?: Distinguishing Eudaimonic and Hedonic User Experiences.", "fields": ["stimulation", "pleasure", "affect", "eudaimonia", "user experience design"], "abstract": "User experience (UX) research has expanded our notion of what makes interactive technology good, often putting hedonic aspects of use such as fun, affect, and stimulation at the center. Outside of UX, the hedonic is often contrasted to the eudaimonic, the notion of striving towards one's personal best. It remains unclear, however, what this distinction offers to UX research conceptually and empirically. We investigate a possible role for eudaimonia in UX research by empirically examining 266 reports of positive experiences with technology and analyzing its relation to established UX concepts. Compared to hedonic experiences, eudaimonic experiences were about striving towards and accomplishing personal goals through technology use. They were also characterized by increased need fulfillment, positive affect, meaning, and long-term importance. Taken together, our findings suggest that while hedonic UX is about momentary pleasures directly derived from technology use, eudaimonic UX is about meaning from need fulfilment.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Basel", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Elisa D.
