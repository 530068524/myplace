{"title": "Precise and compact modular procedure summaries for heap manipulating programs.", "fields": ["heap", "database", "binomial heap", "scalability", "modular design", "pointer analysis", "binary heap", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We present a strictly bottom-up, summary-based, and precise heap analysis targeted for program verification that performs strong updates to heap locations at call sites. We first present a theory of heap decompositions that forms the basis of our approach; we then describe a full analysis algorithm that is fully symbolic and efficient. We demonstrate the precision and scalability of our approach for verification of real C and C++ programs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Isil Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Isil", "Thomas Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Thomas", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex", "Mooly Sagiv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sagiv:Mooly"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2011", "pages": 11}
