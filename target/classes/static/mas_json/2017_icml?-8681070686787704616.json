{"title": "On Approximation Guarantees for Greedy Low Rank Optimization.", "fields": ["greedy randomized adaptive search procedure", "low rank approximation", "maximization", "smoothness", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "We provide new approximation guarantees for greedy low rank matrix estimation under standard assumptions of restricted strong convexity and smoothness. Our novel analysis also uncovers previously unknown connections between the low rank estimation and combinatorial optimization, so much so that our bounds are reminiscent of corresponding approximation bounds in submodular maximization. Additionally, we also provide statistical recovery guarantees. Finally, we present empirical comparison of greedy estimation with established baselines on two important real-world problems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Yale University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Rajiv Khanna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khanna:Rajiv", "Ethan R.
