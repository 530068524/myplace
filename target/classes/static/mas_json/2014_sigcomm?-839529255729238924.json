{"title": "FastForward: fast and constructive full duplex relays.", "fields": ["duplex", "duplex mismatch", "phy", "single antenna interference cancellation", "relay"], "abstract": "This paper presents, FastForward (FF), a novel full duplex relay that constructively forwards signals such that wireless network throughput and coverage is significantly enhanced. FF is a Layer 1 in-band full duplex device, it receives and transmits signals directly and simultaneously on the same frequency. It cleanly integrates into existing networks (both WiFi and LTE) as a separate device and does not require changes to the clients. FF's key invention is a constructive filtering algorithm that transforms the signal at the relay such that when it reaches the destination, it constructively combines with the direct signals from the source and provides a significant throughput gain. We prototype FF using off-the-shelf software radios running a stock WiFi PHY and show experimentally that it provides a 3\u00d7 median throughput increase and nearly a 4\u00d7 gain at the edge of the coverage area.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Dinesh Bharadia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bharadia:Dinesh", "Sachin Katti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katti:Sachin"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
