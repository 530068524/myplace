{"title": "Deus EM Machina: On-Touch Contextual Functionality for Smart IoT Appliances.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "home automation", "web page", "emi", "internet of things"], "abstract": "Homes, offices and many other environments will be increasingly saturated with connected, computational appliances, forming the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT). At present, most of these devices rely on mechanical inputs, webpages, or smartphone apps for control. However, as IoT devices proliferate, these existing interaction methods will become increasingly cumbersome. Will future smart-home owners have to scroll though pages of apps to select and dim their lights? We propose an approach where users simply tap a smartphone to an appliance to discover and rapidly utilize contextual functionality. To achieve this, our prototype smartphone recognizes physical contact with uninstrumented appliances, and summons appliance-specific interfaces. Our user study suggests high accuracy 98.8% recognition accuracy among 17 appliances. Finally, to underscore the immediate feasibility and utility of our system, we built twelve example applications, including six fully functional end-to-end demonstrations.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Robert Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Robert", "Gierad Laput.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laput:Gierad", "Yang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yang", "Chris Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Chris"], "pages": 9}
