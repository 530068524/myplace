Soft-TDMAC has a synchronization mechanism, which synchronizes all pairs of network clocks to within microseconds of each other. Building on pairwise synchronization, Soft-TDMAC achieves network wide synchronization. With, out-of-band, network wide synchronization Soft-TDMAC can schedule arbitrary TDMA transmission patterns. We summarize hundreds of hours of testing Soft-TDMAC on a multi-hop testbed. Our experimental results show that Soft-TDMAC synchronizes multi-hop networks to within a few microsecond sized TDMA slots. Soft-TDMAC can schedule transmissions to take end-to-end demands into account and in a way that decreases end-to-end delay. With no collisions, under good channel conditions, TCP achieves almost the full wireless channel bandwidth.", "citation": "Citations (110)", "departments": ["Carleton University", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Petar Djukic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Djukic:Petar", "Prasant Mohapatra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohapatra:Prasant"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
