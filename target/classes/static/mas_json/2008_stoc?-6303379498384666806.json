We prove a  fully uniform  version of the Direct-Product Theorem with information-theoretically  optimal  parameters, up to constant factors. Namely, we show that for given k and e, there is an efficient randomized algorithm A with the following property. Given a circuit C that computes f k  on at least e fraction of inputs, the algorithm A outputs with probability at least 3/4 a list of O(1/e) circuits such that at least one of the circuits on the list computes f on more than 1-\u03b4 fraction of inputs, for \u03b4 = O((log 1/e)/k). Moreover, each output circuit is an AC 0  circuit (of size poly(n,k,log 1/\u03b4,1/e)), with oracle access to the circuit C. Using the Goldreich-Levin decoding algorithm [5], we also get a  fully uniform  version of Yao's XOR Lemma [18] with  optimal  parameters, up to constant factors. Our results simplify and improve those in [10]. Our main result may be viewed as an efficient approximate, local, list-decoding algorithm for direct-product codes (encoding a function by its values on all k-tuples) with optimal parameters. We generalize it to a family of \"derandomized\" direct-product codes, which we call  intersection codes , where the encoding provides values of the function only on a subfamily of k-tuples. The quality of the decoding algorithm is then determined by sampling properties of the sets in this family and their intersections. As a direct consequence of this generalization we obtain the first derandomized direct product result in the uniform setting, allowing hardness amplification with only constant (as opposed to a factor of k) increase in the input length. Finally, this general setting naturally allows the decoding of concatenated codes, which further yields nearly optimal derandomized amplification.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "Simon Fraser University", "Princeton University", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "kabanets@cs.sfu.ca", "avi@ias.edu"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Russell Impagliazzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Impagliazzo:Russell", "Ragesh Jaiswal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaiswal:Ragesh", "Valentine Kabanets.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kabanets:Valentine", "Avi Wigderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigderson:Avi"], "pages": 10}
