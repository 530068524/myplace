The goal of the study is to assess, from both a tools as well as a methodological perspective, the performance of IBV in an industrial setting. The insights obtained as a result of the project include a refinement of a previously developed architecture for requirements specifications; observations about changes to model-based design workflows; insights into the role of requirements during development; and the capability of automated verification to detect inconsistencies among requirements as well as between requirements and design models.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Bosch"], "authors": ["Arnab Ray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ray:Arnab", "Iris Morschhaeuser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morschhaeuser:Iris", "Christopher Ackermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ackermann:Christopher", "Rance Cleaveland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cleaveland:Rance", "Charles P.
