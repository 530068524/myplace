Here we propose a formal model of one specific semantic search task: ad-hoc object retrieval. We show that this task provides a solid framework to study some of the semantic search problems currently tackled by commercial Web search engines. We connect this task to the traditional ad-hoc document retrieval and discuss appropriate evaluation metrics. Finally, we carry out a realistic evaluation of this task in the context of a Web search application.", "citation": "Citations (206)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Jeffrey Pound.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pound:Jeffrey", "Peter Mika.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mika:Peter", "Hugo Zaragoza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaragoza:Hugo"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
