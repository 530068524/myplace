We focus on cost functions of the form f(x) = s + x^a for x >, 0, with f(0) = 0. For a 1 with a positive startup cost s >, 0. Now, the cost function f(.) is neither sub additive nor super additive. This is motivated by minimizing network-wide energy consumption when supporting a set of traffic demands. It is commonly accepted that, for some computing and communication devices, doubling processing speed more than doubles the energy consumption. Hence, in Economics parlance, such a cost function reflects diseconomies of scale. We begin by discussing why existing routing techniques such as randomized rounding and tree-metric embedding fail to generalize directly. We then present our main contribution, which is a polylogarithmic approximation algorithm. We obtain this result by first deriving a bicriteria approximation for a related capacitated min-cost flow problem that we believe is interesting in its own right. Our approach for this problem builds upon the well-linked decomposition due to Chekuri-Khanna-Shepherd, the construction of expanders via matchings due to Khandekar-Rao-Vazirani, and edge-disjoint routing in well-connected graphs due to Rao-Zhou. However, we also develop new techniques that allow us to keep a handle on the total cost, which was not a concern in the aforementioned literature.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Matthew Andrews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andrews:Matthew", "Spyridon Antonakopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antonakopoulos:Spyridon", "Lisa Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lisa"], "pages": 8}
