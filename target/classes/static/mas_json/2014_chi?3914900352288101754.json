However, actual or anticipated pain exacerbation, and lack of confidence when doing physical activity, make it difficult to maintain and build towards long-term activity goals. Research guiding the design of interactive technology to motivate and support physical activity in people with chronic pain is lacking. We conducted studies with: (1) people with chronic pain, to understand how they maintained and increased physical activity in daily life and what factors deterred them; and (2) pain-specialist physiotherapists, to understand how they supported people with chronic pain. Building on this understanding, we investigated the use of auditory feedback to address some of the psychological barriers and needs identified and to increase self-efficacy, motivation and confidence in physical activity. We conclude by discussing further design opportunities based on the overall findings.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Aneesha Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Aneesha", "Annina Klapper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klapper:Annina", "Jinni Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jinni", "Antonio Fidalgo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fidalgo:Antonio", "Ana Tajadura-Jim\u00e9nez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tajadura=Jim=eacute=nez:Ana", "Natalie Kanakam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanakam:Natalie", "Nadia Bianchi-Berthouze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bianchi=Berthouze:Nadia", "Amanda C. de C.
