{"title": "Analyzing User's Sequential Behavior in Query Auto-Completion via Markov Processes.", "fields": ["prefix", "keystroke logging", "hidden markov model", "markov process", "typing"], "abstract": "Query auto-completion (QAC) plays an important role in assisting users typing less while submitting a query. The QAC engine generally offers a list of suggested queries that start with a user's input as a prefix, and the list of suggestions is changed to match the updated input after the user types each keystroke. Therefore rich user interactions can be observed along with each keystroke until a user clicks a suggestion or types the entire query manually. It becomes increasingly important to analyze and understand users' interactions with the QAC engine, to improve its performance. Existing works on QAC either ignored users' interaction data, or assumed that their interactions at each keystroke are independent from others. Our paper pays high attention to users' sequential interactions with a QAC engine in and across QAC sessions, rather than users' interactions at each keystroke of each QAC session separately. Analyzing the dependencies in users' sequential interactions improves our understanding of the following three questions: 1) how is a user's skipping/viewing move at the current keystroke influenced by that at the previous keystroke? 2) how to improve search engines' query suggestions at short keystrokes based on those at latter long keystrokes? and 3) facing a targeted query shown in the suggestion list, why does a user decide to continue typing rather than click the intended suggestion? We propose a probabilistic model that addresses those three questions in a unified way, and illustrate how the model determines users' final click decisions. By comparing with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed model does suggest queries that better satisfy users' intents.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "East China Normal University"], "authors": ["Liangda Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Liangda", "Hongbo Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Hongbo", "Anlei Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Anlei", "Yi Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yi", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan", "Ricardo A.
