Although private-key functional encryption (supporting an unbounded number of keys and ciphertexts) seems significantly weaker than its public-key variant, its known realizations all rely on public-key functional encryption. At the same time, however, up until recently it was not known to imply any public-key primitive, demonstrating our poor understanding of this extremely-useful primitive.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Ilan Komargodski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komargodski:Ilan", "Gil Segev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segev:Gil"], "pages": 30}
