{"title": "AdBudgetKiller: Online Advertising Budget Draining Attack.", "fields": ["web crawler", "world wide web", "internet privacy", "fetch", "online advertising"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new ad budget draining attack. By repeatedly pulling ads from targeted advertisers using crafted browsing profiles, we are able to reduce the chance of showing their ads to real-human visitors and trash the ad budget. From the advertiser profiles collected by an automated crawler, we infer advertising strategies, train satisfying browsing profiles and launch large-scale attacks. We evaluate our methods on 291 public advertisers selected from Alexa Top 500, where we successfully reveal the targeting strategies used by 87% of the advertisers we considered. We also executed a series of attacks against a controlled advertiser and 3 real-world advertisers within the ethical and legal boundary. The results show that we are able to fetch 40,958 ads and drain up to $155.89 from the targeted advertisers within an hour.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "IBM", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["I Luk Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:I_Luk", "Weihang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Weihang", "Yonghwi Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Yonghwi", "Yunhui Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yunhui", "Yousra Aafer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aafer:Yousra", "Weijie Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Weijie", "Xiangyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Xiangyu"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
