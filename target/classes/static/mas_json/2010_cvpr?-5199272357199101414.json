We show how estimating the rapid motion of the camera can be posed as a temporal super-resolution problem. The low-frequency measurements are the motions of pixels from one frame to the next. These measurements are modeled as temporal integrals of the underlying high-frequency jitter of the camera. The estimated high-frequency motion of the camera is then used to re-render the sequence as though all the pixels in each frame were imaged at the same time. We also present an auto-calibration algorithm that can estimate the time between the capture of subsequent rows in the camera.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Simon Baker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baker:Simon", "Eric P.
