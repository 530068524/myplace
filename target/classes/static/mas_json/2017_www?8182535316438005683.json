{"title": "Automated Template Generation for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs.", "fields": ["graph", "principle of compositionality", "question answering", "template", "parsing"], "abstract": "Templates are an important asset for question answering over knowledge graphs, simplifying the semantic parsing of input utterances and generating structured queries for interpretable answers. State-of-the-art methods rely on hand-crafted templates with limited coverage. This paper presents QUINT, a system that automatically learns utterance-query templates solely from user questions paired with their answers. Additionally, QUINT is able to harness language compositionality for answering complex questions without having any templates for the entire question. Experiments with different benchmarks demonstrate the high quality of QUINT.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Northeastern University", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Abdalghani Abujabal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abujabal:Abdalghani", "Mohamed Yahya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yahya:Mohamed", "Mirek Riedewald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riedewald:Mirek", "Gerhard Weikum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weikum:Gerhard"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
