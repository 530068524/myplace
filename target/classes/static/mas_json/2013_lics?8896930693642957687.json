{"title": "Decidability of Weak Simulation on One-Counter Nets.", "fields": ["simulation preorder", "undecidable problem", "subclass", "bisimulation", "decidability"], "abstract": "One-counter nets (OCN) are Petri nets with exactly one unbounded place. They are equivalent to a subclass of one-counter automata with only a weak test for zero. We show that weak simulation preorder is decidable for OCN and that weak simulation approximants do not converge at level \u03c9, but only at \u03c9 2 . In contrast, other semantic relations like weak bisimulation are undecidable for OCN [1], and so are weak (and strong) trace inclusion (Sec. VII).", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Piotr Hofman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofman:Piotr", "Richard Mayr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayr:Richard", "Patrick Totzke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Totzke:Patrick"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
