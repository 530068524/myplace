{"title": "Generalized Biwords for Bitext Compression and Translation Spotting: Extended Abstract.", "fields": ["expression", "exploit", "spotting", "intermediate language", "binary number"], "abstract": "Large bilingual parallel texts (also known as bitexts) are usually  stored in a compressed form, and previous work has shown that they can  be more efficiently compressed if the fact that the two texts are mutual  translations is exploited. For example, a bitext can be seen as a  sequence of biwords ---pairs of parallel words with a high probability  of co-occurrence--- that can be used as an intermediate representation  in the compression process.  However, the simple biword approach  described in the literature can only exploit one-to-one word alignments  and cannot tackle the reordering of words. We therefore introduce a  generalization of biwords which can describe multi-word expressions and  reorderings.  We also describe some methods for the binary compression  of generalized biword sequences, and compare their performance when  different schemes are applied to the extraction of the biword sequence.  In addition, we show that this generalization of biwords allows for the  implementation of an efficient algorithm to look on the compressed  bitext for words or text segments in one of the texts and retrieve their  counterpart translations in the other text ---an application usually  referred to as translation spotting--- with only some minor  modifications in the compression algorithm.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Valladolid", "University of Valladolid", "Dep. de Llengua ...
