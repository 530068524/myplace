We pose the problem of video summarization as one of time-series clustering, and proposed Constrained Aligned Cluster Analysis (CACA). CACA combines kernel k-means, Dynamic Time Alignment Kernel (DTAK), and unlike previous work, CACA jointly optimizes video segmentation and shot clustering. CACA is effciently solved via dynamic programming. Experimental results on the TRECVID 2007 and 2008 BBC rushes video summarization databases validate the accuracy and effectiveness of CACA.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0007:Yang", "Feng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0002:Feng", "Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wei", "Fernando De la Torre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torre:Fernando_De_la", "Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0004:Yan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
