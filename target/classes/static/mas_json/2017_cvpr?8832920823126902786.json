{"title": "A Non-convex Variational Approach to Photometric Stereo under Inaccurate Lighting.", "fields": ["random variable", "regular polygon", "robustness", "photometric stereo", "outlier"], "abstract": "This paper tackles the photometric stereo problem in the presence of inaccurate lighting, obtained either by calibration or by an uncalibrated photometric stereo method. Based on a precise modeling of noise and outliers, a robust variational approach is introduced. It explicitly accounts for self-shadows, and enforces robustness to cast-shadows and specularities by resorting to redescending M-estimators. The resulting non-convex model is solved by means of a computationally efficient alternating reweighted least-squares algorithm. Since it implicitly enforces integrability, the new variational approach can refine both the intensities and the directions of the lighting.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Toulouse", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yvain Qu\u00e9au.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu=eacute=au:Yvain", "Tao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0006:Tao", "Fran\u00e7ois Lauze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lauze:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Jean-Denis Durou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durou:Jean=Denis", "Daniel Cremers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cremers:Daniel"], "pages": 10}
