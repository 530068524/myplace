The size of the constructed nets is polynomial in the dimension n and in 1/e. To the best of our knowledge no such constructions were previously known. Our results match, up to the exponent of the polynomial, the bounds that are achieved by probabilistic arguments. As a corollary we also construct subsets of the binary cube that have size polynomial in n and covering radius of n/2 - c\u221a{n log n}, for any constant c. This improves upon the well known construction of dual BCH codes that only guarantee covering radius of n/2 - c\u221an.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yuval Rabani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabani:Yuval", "Amir Shpilka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shpilka:Amir"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
