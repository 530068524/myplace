However, the application of network coding may not always improve the network performance. In this paper 1 , we provide a comprehensive analytical study, which helps in assessing when network coding is preferable to a traditional store-and-forward approach. Interestingly, our study reveals that in many topological scenarios, network coding can in fact hurt the throughput performance; in such scenarios, applying the store-and-forward approach leads to higher network throughput. We validate our analytical findings via extensive testbed experiments, and we extract guidelines on when network coding should be applied instead of store-and-forward.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside", "University of Thessaly", "University of California, Riverside"], "authors": ["Ahmed Osama Fathy Atya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atya:Ahmed_Osama_Fathy", "Ioannis Broustis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broustis:Ioannis", "Shailendra Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh_0004:Shailendra", "Dimitris Syrivelis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Syrivelis:Dimitris", "Srikanth V.
