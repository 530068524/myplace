Several hollow needles are percutaneously inserted in the target area under image guidance and a gas (usually argon) is then decompressed inside the needles. Based on the Thompson-Joule principle, the temperature drops drown and a ball of ice crystals forms around the tip of each needle. Radiologists rely on the geometry of this iceball (273 K), visible on computer tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images, to assess the status of the ablation. However, cellular death only occurs when the temperature falls below 233 K. The complexity of the procedure therefore resides in planning the optimal number, position and orientation of the needles required to treat the tumor, while avoiding any damage to the surrounding healthy tissues.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Hugo Talbot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talbot:Hugo", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=rick", "St\u00e9phane Cotin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cotin:St=eacute=phane"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
