For this problem, we present the first purely geometric approach. Comparing to existing graph-based approaches (e.g., median graph, shock graph), our approach has several unique advantages: (1) No encoding and decoding procedures are needed to map between objects and graphs, and therefore avoid errors caused by information losing during the mappings; (2) Staying only in the geometric domain makes our approach computationally more efficient and robust to noise. We evaluate the performance of our technique for prototype reconstruction on a random dataset and a benchmark dataset, handwriting Chinese characters. Experiments suggest that our technique considerably outperforms the existing graph-based methods.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Hu Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Hu", "Jinhui Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Jinhui"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
