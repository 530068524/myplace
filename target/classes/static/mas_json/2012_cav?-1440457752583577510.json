{"title": "passert: A Tool for Debugging Parallel Programs.", "fields": ["debugging", "correctness", "assertion", "concurrency", "geometric mean"], "abstract": "passert is a new debugging tool for parallel programs which allows programmers to express correctness criteria using a simple, expressive assertion language. We demonstrate how these parallel assertions allow the detection and diagnosis of real world concurrency bugs, detecting 14/17 bugs in an independently selected set of bugs from open source software. We describe a runtime checker which allows automatic checking of parallel assertions in C and C++ programs, with a geometric mean of 6.6\u00d7 overhead on a set of PARSEC benchmarks. We improve performance by introducing a relaxed timing semantics for parallel assertions, which better reflects real memory models, and exposes more bugs with less overhead (geometric mean overhead 3.5\u00d7).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Daniel Schwartz-Narbonne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwartz=Narbonne:Daniel", "Feng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Feng", "David I.
