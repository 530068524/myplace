While router-based networks-on-chip (NoCs) offer superior scalability, they also incur significant power and area overhead due to complex router structures. In this paper, we explore a new class of on-chip networks, referred to as \\textit{Routerless NoCs}, where routers are completely eliminated. We propose a novel design that utilizes on-chip wiring resources smartly to achieve comparable hop count and scalability as router-based NoCs. Several effective techniques are also proposed that significantly reduce the resource requirement to avoid new network abnormalities in routerless NoC designs. Evaluation results show that, compared with a conventional mesh, the proposed routerless NoC achieves 9.5X reduction in power, 7.2X reduction in area, 2.5X reduction in zero-load packet latency, and 1.7X increase in throughput. Compared with a state-of-the-art low-cost NoC design, the proposed approach achieves 7.7X reduction in power, 3.3X reduction in area, 1.3X reduction in zero-load packet latency, and 1.6X increase in throughput.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Fawaz Alazemi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alazemi:Fawaz", "Arash AziziMazreah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/AziziMazreah:Arash", "Bella Bose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bose:Bella", "Lizhong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lizhong"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2018", "pages": 12}
