One approach to supporting group brainstorming is to introduce conceptual diversity. In this study, we evaluate the effects of two sources of diversity on group brainstorming: cultural differences internal to multicultural groups and pictures related to the conversation retrieved by a computer agent. The pictures generally enhanced performance as measured by both originality and diversity of ideas. The pictures also helped to convert cultural diversity into a creative outcome, the diversity of ideas generated. We argue that with appropriate technology mediation, cultural diversity may be used strategically to enhance task outcomes.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Hao-Chuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hao=Chuan", "Susan R.
