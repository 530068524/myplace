{"title": "An Experimentally Efficient Method for (MSS, CoMSS) Partitioning.", "fields": ["computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The concepts of MSS (Maximal Satisfiable Subset) and CoMSS (also called Minimal Correction Subset) play a key role in many A.I. approaches and techniques. In this paper, a novel algorithm for partitioning a Boolean CNF formula into one MSS and the corresponding CoMSS is introduced. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that it is more robust and more efficient on most instances than currently available techniques.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["\u00c9ric Gr\u00e9goire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=eacute=goire:=Eacute=ric", "Jean-Marie Lagniez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lagniez:Jean=Marie", "Bertrand Mazure.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazure:Bertrand"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 8}
