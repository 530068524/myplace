{"title": "A crevice on the Crane Beach: Finite-degree predicates.", "fields": ["predicate", "binary number", "discrete mathematics", "expressive power", "locality"], "abstract": "First-order logic (FO) over words is shown to be equiexpressive with FO equipped with a restricted set of numerical predicates, namely the order, a binary predicate MSB 0 , and the finite-degree predicates: FO[A RB ] = FO[\u2264, MSB 0 , F IN ]. The Crane Beach Property (CBP), introduced more than a decade ago, is true of a logic if all the expressible languages admitting a neutral letter are regular. Although it is known that FO[A RB ] does not have the CBP, it is shown here that the (strong form of the) CBP holds for both FO[\u2264, F IN ] and FO[\u2264, MSB 0 ]. Thus FO[\u2264, F IN ] exhibits a form of locality and the CBP, and can still express a wide variety of languages, while being one simple predicate away from the expressive power of FO[A RB ]. The counting ability of FO[\u2264, F IN ] is studied as an application.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of T\u00fcbingen"], "authors": ["Micha\u00ebl Cadilhac.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cadilhac:Micha=euml=l", "Charles Paperman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paperman:Charles"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
