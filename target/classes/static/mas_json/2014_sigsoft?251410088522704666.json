Abstraction techniques have successfully alleviated state explosion in single-system models. However, they need to be adapted to SPLs, to take into account the set of variants that produce a counterexample. In this paper, we apply CEGAR (Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement) and we design new forms of abstraction specifically for SPLs. We carry out experiments to evaluate the efficiency of our new abstractions. The results show that our abstractions, combined with an appropriate refinement strategy, hold the potential to achieve large reductions in verification time, although they sometimes perform worse. We discuss in which cases a given abstraction should be used.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "Universit\u00e9 de Namur"], "authors": ["Maxime Cordy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cordy:Maxime", "Patrick Heymans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heymans:Patrick", "Axel Legay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Legay:Axel", "Pierre-Yves Schobbens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schobbens:Pierre=Yves", "Bruno Dawagne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dawagne:Bruno", "Martin Leucker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leucker:Martin"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
