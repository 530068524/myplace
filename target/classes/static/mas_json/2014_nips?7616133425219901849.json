{"title": "Parallel Sampling of HDPs using Sub-Cluster Splits.", "fields": ["hierarchical dirichlet process", "merge", "sampling", "parallel algorithm", "convergence"], "abstract": "We develop a sampling technique for Hierarchical Dirichlet process models. The parallel algorithm builds upon [1] by proposing large split and merge moves based on learned sub-clusters. The additional global split and merge moves drastically improve convergence in the experimental results. Furthermore, we discover that cross-validation techniques do not adequately determine convergence, and that previous sampling methods converge slower than were previously expected.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jason Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Jason", "John W.
