Collecting posts or messages relevant to the topic from a social media source is a necessary step. Due to the huge size of social media sources (e.g., Twitter and Facebook), one has to use some topic keywords to search for possibly relevant posts. However, gathering a good set of keywords is a very tedious and time-consuming task. It often involves a lengthy iterative process of searching and manual reading. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to help the user identify topical search keywords. Our experiments are carried out on identifying such keywords for five (5) real-life application topics to be used for searching relevant tweets from the Twitter API. The results show that the proposed method is highly effective.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Shuai Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shuai", "Zhiyuan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Zhiyuan", "Bing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Bing", "Sherry Emery.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emery:Sherry"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
