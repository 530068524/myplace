In this paper, we introduce a task of recommending quotes which are suitable for given dialogue context and we present a deep learning recommender system which combines recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network in order to learn semantic representation of each utterance and construct a sequence model for the dialog thread. We collected a large set of twitter dialogues with quote occurrences in order to evaluate proposed recommender system. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms not only the other state-of-the-art algorithms in quote recommendation task, but also other neural network based methods built for similar tasks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Samsung", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Hanbit Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hanbit", "Yeonchan Ahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahn:Yeonchan", "Haejun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Haejun", "Seungdo Ha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ha:Seungdo", "Sang-goo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sang=goo"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
