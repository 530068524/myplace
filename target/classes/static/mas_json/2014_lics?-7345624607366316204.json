{"title": "On Hanf-equivalence and the number of embeddings of small induced subgraphs.", "fields": ["bijection", "chordal graph", "vertex", "indifference graph", "degree"], "abstract": "Two graphs are Hanf-equivalent with respect to radius  r  if there is a bijection between their vertex sets which preserves the isomorphism types of the vertices' neighbourhoods of radius  r . For  r  = 1 this means that the graphs have the same degree sequence.   In this paper we relate Hanf-equivalence to the graph-theoretical concept of subgraph equivalence. To make this concept applicable to graphs that are not necessarily connected, we first generalise the notion of the radius of a connected graph to general graphs in a suitable way, which we call the  generalised radius . We say that two graphs  G  and  H  are subgraph-equivalent up to generalised radius  r  if for all graphs  S  of generalised radius  r , the number of induced subgraphs isomorphic to  S  is the same in  G  and  H . We prove that Hanf-equivalence with respect to radius  r  is equivalent to subgraph-equivalence up to generalised radius  r , thereby relating the purely logical and the graph-theoretical concepts in a very strong way.   The notion of subgraph-equivalence up to order  s  is defined accordingly, where all graphs  S  of order at most s are taken into account. As a corollary we obtain that Hanf-equivalence with respect to radius  r  implies subgraph-equivalence up to order  s , provided that  r  \u2265 3 s /4. In particular, this implies that two graphs which are Hanf-equivalent with respect to radius 3 s /4 satisfy exactly the same unions of conjunctive queries of quantifier rank at most  s .", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Goethe University Frankfurt"], "authors": ["Stephan Kreutzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kreutzer:Stephan", "Nicole Schweikardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schweikardt:Nicole"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
