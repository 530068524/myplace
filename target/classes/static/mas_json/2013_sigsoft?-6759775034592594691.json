Such agreements are not legal documents and must address different issues than traditional software licenses. We found that these agreements should cover what is granted, payment, support, ownership and liability. In a case study we learned that an agreement should list its assumptions on the structure and processes of the software organization. The presented work enables others to create guidelines for software sharing agreements tailored to their organization and shares lessons about the differences between software product lines and corporate software sharing and reuse.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["ABB Ltd", "ABB Ltd"], "authors": ["Thijmen de Gooijer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gooijer:Thijmen_de", "Heiko Koziolek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koziolek:Heiko"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
