We derive an accelerated smoothed algorithm with a convergence rate of \u221alog n/\u03c1 given n separable points, which is strikingly similar to the classical kernelized Perceptron algorithm whose rate is 1/\u03c12. When no such classifier exists, we prove a version of Gordan's separation theorem for RKHSs, and give a reinterpretation of negative margins. This allows us to give guarantees for a primal-dual algorithm that halts in min{\u221an/|\u03c1|,\u221an/e} iterations with a perfect separator in the RKHS if the primal is feasible or a dual e-certificate of near-infeasibility.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Aaditya Ramdas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramdas:Aaditya", "Javier Pe\u00f1a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pe=ntilde=a:Javier"], "pages": 9}
