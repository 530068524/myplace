{"title": "Does Collectivism Inhibit Individual Creativity?: The Effects of Collectivism and Perceived Diversity on Individual Creativity and Satisfaction in Virtual Ideation Teams.", "fields": ["collectivism", "collaboration", "ideation", "team diversity", "brainstorming"], "abstract": "One particular problem CSCW and HCI scholars have sought to address through the design of collaborative systems is the issues associated with diversity and creativity. Diversity can promote creativity by exposing individuals to different perspectives and at the same time make it difficult for teams to leverage their differences to be more creative. This paper asserts that through the promotion of cooperation, collectivism will help ideation team members overcome the challenges associated with diversity and promote creativity. To examine this assertion, we conducted an experimental study involving 107 individuals in 33 idea-generation teams. Collectivism was promoted through priming. The results confirm our assertion: collectivism created conditions that facilitated creativity when teams were high in perceived diversity. Collectivism also facilitated more satisfaction among teammates by offsetting negative perceptions of diversity. These results offer new insights on collectivism, perceived diversity and creativity.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Teng Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Teng", "Lionel P.
