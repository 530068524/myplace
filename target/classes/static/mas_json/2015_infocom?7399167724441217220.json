In this paper, we introduce a novel load-balancing approach that provides more processing power to congested linecards by tapping into the processing power of underutilized linecards. Using different switch-fabric models, we introduce algorithms that aim at minimizing the total average delay and maximizing the capacity region. Our simulations with real-life traces then confirm that our algorithms outperform current algorithms as well as simple alternative load-balancing algorithms. Finally, we discuss the implementation issues involved in this new way of sharing the router processing power.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Marat Radan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radan:Marat", "Isaac Keslassy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keslassy:Isaac"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
