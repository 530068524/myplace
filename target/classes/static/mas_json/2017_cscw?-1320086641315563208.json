We extend this vein of inquiry to focus on photo sharing in the context of the Arab Gulf. We provide insight into how this activity is practiced in a region governed by strict adherence to cultural norms and Islamic traditions that dictate how to \"appropriately\" share content in digital settings. In particular, we look at the relationship between photo sharing and its effects on identity and self-presentation. To understand how Saudi and Qatari participants represent themselves through photo sharing applications, we conducted 42 face-to-face interviews. Our results reveal that Arab Gulf users engage in photo sharing practices that construct a collective self, distinct from an autonomous self. This collective self often trumps the autonomous self in shaping photo sharing practices.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Norah Abokhodair.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abokhodair:Norah", "Adam Hodges.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hodges:Adam", "Sarah Vieweg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vieweg:Sarah"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 16}
