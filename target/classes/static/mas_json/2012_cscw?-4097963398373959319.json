In a 3x2 factorial experiment (N = 84), we manipulate two variables of interest for social visualization systems: the  feedback configuration  of the system's display (participants receive self feedback vs. partner feedback vs. no feedback) and the  status  of the interactants (high vs. low). Receiving feedback about one's own arousal level has negative consequences for performance in and feelings about the negotiation. Receiving feedback about one's partner's arousal level interacts with status: high-status individuals benefit from the visualization, while low-status individuals do not.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Samsung", "Stanford University", "Massachusettes  ... sachusetts, USA"], "authors": ["Michael Nowak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nowak:Michael", "Juho Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Juho", "Nam Wook Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Nam_Wook", "Clifford Nass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nass:Clifford"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
