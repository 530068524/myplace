We present a concrete design and implementation of protocols achieving security guarantees that are much stronger than are possible with semi-honest protocols, at minimal extra cost. Specifically, we consider protocols in which a malicious adversary may learn a single (arbitrary) bit of additional information about the honest party's input. Correctness of the honest party's output is still guaranteed. Adapting prior work of Mohassel and Franklin, the basic idea in our protocols is to conduct two separate runs of a (specific) semi-honest, garbled-circuit protocol, with the parties swapping roles, followed by an inexpensive secure equality test. We provide a rigorous definition and prove that this protocol leaks no more than one additional bit against a malicious adversary. In addition, we propose some heuristic enhancements to reduce the overall information a cheating adversary learns. Our experiments show that protocols meeting this security level can be implemented at cost very close to that of protocols that only achieve semi-honest security. Our results indicate that this model enables the large-scale, practical applications possible within the semi-honest security model, while providing dramatically stronger security guarantees.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Yan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Yan", "Jonathan Katz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katz:Jonathan", "David Evans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Evans_0001:David"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2012", "pages": 13}
