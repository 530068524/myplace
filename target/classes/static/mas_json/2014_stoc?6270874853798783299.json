The only parameters which depend on the size of the input are the soundness of the protocol and the security of the output (both are inverse exponential in  m ). This settles a long-standing open problem in the area of randomness expansion and device-independence.   The analysis of our protocols involves overcoming fundamental challenges in the study of  adaptive  device-independent protocols. Our primary technical contribution is the design and analysis of device-independent protocols which are  Input Secure ; that is, their output is guaranteed to be secure against a quantum eavesdropper,  even if the input randomness was generated by that same eavesdropper !   The notion of Input Security may be of independent interest to other areas such as device-independent quantum key distribution.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Matthew Coudron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coudron:Matthew", "Henry Yuen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuen:Henry"], "pages": 10}
