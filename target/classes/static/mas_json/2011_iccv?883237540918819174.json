We combine geometric and photometric cues in a Bayesian framework, building on recent successes leveraging the indoor Manhattan assumption in monocular vision. We focus on indoor environments and show how to extract key boundaries while ignoring clutter and decorations. To achieve this we present a graphical model that relates photometric cues learned from labeled data, stereo photo-consistency across multiple views, and depth cues derived from structure-from-motion point clouds. We show how to solve MAP inference using dynamic programming, allowing exact, global inference in \u223c100 ms (in addition to feature computation of under one second) without using specialized hardware. Experiments show our system out-performing the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Alex Flint.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flint:Alex", "David W.
