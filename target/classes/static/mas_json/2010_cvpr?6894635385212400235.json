Existing methods using a projector or display usually assume a perfectly diffuse or specular surface for estimating the 3D shape of the objects. We develop a hybrid method for estimating the 3D shape of glossy surfaces that incorporates both diffuse and specular components by combining a projector with a display. In addition, we propose the phase reliability evaluation in phase-shifting method for combining the matching cost functions of projector-display.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Masaki Yamazaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamazaki:Masaki", "Gang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Gang"], "pages": 8}
