Our constructions are based on a new quantum rewinding technique that allows us to extract witnesses in many classical proofs of knowledge. We give criteria under which a classical proof of knowledge is a quantum proof of knowledge. Combining our results with Watrous' results on quantum zero-knowledge, we show that there are zero-knowledge quantum proofs of knowledge for all languages in NP (assuming quantum 1-1 one-way functions).", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Tartu"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Dominique Unruh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unruh:Dominique"], "pages": 18}
