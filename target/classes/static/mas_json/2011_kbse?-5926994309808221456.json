{"title": "Self-adaptive software meets control theory: A preliminary approach supporting reliability requirements.", "fields": ["markov chain", "discrete time and continuous time", "non functional requirement", "software quality", "formal verification"], "abstract": "This paper investigates a novel approach to derive self-adaptive software by automatically modifying the model of the application using a control-theoretical approach. Self adaptation is achieved at the model level to assure that the model -- which lives alongside the application at run-time --continues to satisfy its reliability requirements, despite changes in the environment that might lead to a violation. We assume that the model is given in terms of a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC). DTMCs can express reliability concerns by modeling possible failures through transitions to failure states. Reliability requirements may be expressed as reachability properties that constrain the probability to reach certain states, denoted as failure states.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "20133, Italy", "20133, Italy"], "authors": ["Antonio Filieri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filieri:Antonio", "Carlo Ghezzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghezzi:Carlo", "Alberto Leva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leva:Alberto", "Martina Maggio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maggio:Martina"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
