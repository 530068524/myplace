{"title": "Constructing the Visual Online Political Self: An Analysis of Instagram Use by the Scottish Electorate.", "fields": ["democracy", "independence referendum", "voting behavior", "political communication", "general election"], "abstract": "This paper presents an investigation of how the Scottish electorate utilised photo-sharing on social media as a means of participation in the democratic process and for political self-expression in the periods immediately prior to two recent major democratic votes: the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and the 2015 UK general election. We extend previous HCI literature on the growing use of social media in a political context and contribute specifically on understanding the emergent use of visual media by citizens when engaging with political issues and democratic process. Through a qualitative analysis of images shared on the platform Instagram, we demonstrate that the Scottish electorate did indeed used image-sharing for political self-expression -- posting a variety of visual content, representative of a diversity of political opinion. We conclude that users utilised Instagram as a platform to craft and present their \"political selves\". We raise questions for future research around power and inequality on such platforms as well as their capability of providing a persistent forum for debate.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Lincoln", "Northumbria University", "University of Lincoln", "Northumbria University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jamie Mahoney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahoney:Jamie", "Tom Feltwell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feltwell:Tom", "Obinna Ajuruchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ajuruchi:Obinna", "Shaun W.
