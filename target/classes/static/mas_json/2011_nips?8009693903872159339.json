This paper introduces Collective Graphical Models\u2014a framework for modeling and probabilistic inference that operates directly on the sufficient statistics of the individual model. We derive a highly-efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm for sampling from the posterior distribution of the sufficient statistics conditioned on noisy aggregate observations, prove its correctness, and demonstrate its effectiveness experimentally.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Daniel R.
