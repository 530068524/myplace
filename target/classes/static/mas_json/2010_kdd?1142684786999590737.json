These types of structured metadata provide valuable evidence for learning how a community organizes knowledge. For instance, we can aggregate many personal hierarchies into a common taxonomy, also known as a folksonomy, that will aid users in visualizing and browsing social content, and also to help them in organizing their own content. However, learning from social metadata presents several challenges, since it is sparse, shallow, ambiguous, noisy, and inconsistent. We describe an approach to folksonomy learning based on relational clustering, which exploits structured metadata contained in personal hierarchies. Our approach clusters similar hierarchies using their structure and tag statistics, then incrementally weaves them into a deeper, bushier tree. We study folksonomy learning using social metadata extracted from the photo-sharing site Flickr, and demonstrate that the proposed approach addresses the challenges. Moreover, comparing to previous work, the approach produces larger, more accurate folksonomies, and in addition, scales better.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Information Sciences Institute", "Information Sciences Institute", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Anon Plangprasopchok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plangprasopchok:Anon", "Kristina Lerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerman:Kristina", "Lise Getoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Getoor:Lise"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
