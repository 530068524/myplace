Our main result is an impossibility: there are no incentive-compatible auctions that always produce a Pareto-optimal allocation. We also obtain some surprising positive results for certain special cases.", "citation": "Citations (138)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Cornell University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Google"], "authors": ["Shahar Dobzinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobzinski:Shahar", "Ron Lavi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lavi:Ron", "Noam Nisan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nisan:Noam"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
