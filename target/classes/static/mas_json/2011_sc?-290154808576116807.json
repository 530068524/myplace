In this work, we explore the design space of parallel algorithms for Breadth-First Search (BFS), a key subroutine in several graph algorithms. We present two highly-tuned parallel approaches for BFS on large parallel systems: a level-synchronous strategy that relies on a simple vertex-based partitioning of the graph, and a two-dimensional sparse matrix partitioning-based approach that mitigates parallel communication overhead. For both approaches, we also present hybrid versions with intra-node multithreading. Our novel hybrid two-dimensional algorithm reduces communication times by up to a factor of 3.5, relative to a common vertex based approach. Our experimental study identifies execution regimes in which these approaches will be competitive, and we demonstrate extremely high performance on leading distributed-memory parallel systems. For instance, for a 40,000-core parallel execution on Hopper, an AMD Magny-Cours based system, we achieve a BFS performance rate of 17.8 billion edge visits per second on an undirected graph of 4.3 billion vertices and 68.7 billion edges with skewed degree distribution.", "citation": "Citations (184)", "departments": ["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Aydin Bulu\u00e7.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulu=ccedil=:Aydin", "Kamesh Madduri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madduri:Kamesh"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
