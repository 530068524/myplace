Nevertheless, there are several parameters that affect the performance of a transactional memory, for example the locality of the application and the cache line size of the processor. In this paper, we investigate dynamic tuning mechanisms on a new time-based software transactional memory implementation. We study in extensive measurements the performance of our implementation and exhibit the benefits of dynamic tuning. We compare our results with TL2, which is currently one of the fastest word-based software transactional memories.", "citation": "Citations (540)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Neuch\u00e2tel", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Pascal Felber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felber:Pascal", "Christof Fetzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fetzer:Christof", "Torvald Riegel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riegel:Torvald"], "pages": 10}
