Large-scale studies on activity tracking performed with eyewear-type wearable devices remains a challenging area owing to the negative effect such devices have on users' looks. To cope with this challenge, JINS Inc., an eyewear retailer in Japan, has developed a state-of-the-art smart eyewear called JINS MEME. The design of JINS MEME is almost the same as that of Wellington-type eyeglasses so that people can use it in their daily lives. JINS MEME is equipped with sensors to detect a user's eye movement and head motion. In addition to these functions of JINS MEME, JINS developed an application to measure concentration levels of users. In this demonstration, users will experience wearing the JINS MEME glasses and their concentration will be measured while they perform a certain task at our booth.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["JINS Inc., Japan", "JINS Inc., Japan"], "authors": ["Yuji Uema.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uema:Yuji", "Kazutaka Inoue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inoue:Kazutaka"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
