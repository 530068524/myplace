The verifier is able to recover m from \u03c4 and at the same time verify its authenticity. The two most important parameters of such a scheme are its security and overhead |\u03c4| \u2212 |m|. A simple argument shows that for any scheme with \u201cn bits security\u201d |\u03c4| \u2212 |m| \u2265 n, i.e., the overhead is lower bounded by the security parameter n. Currently, the best known constructions in the random oracle model are far from this lower bound requiring an overhead of n + logq h , where q h is the number of queries to the random oracle. In this paper we give a construction which basically matches the n bit lower bound. We propose a simple digital signature scheme with n + o(logq h ) bits overhead, where q h denotes the number of random oracle queries.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Ruhr University Bochum", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Eike Kiltz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiltz:Eike", "Krzysztof Pietrzak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietrzak:Krzysztof", "Mario Szegedy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szegedy:Mario"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 18}
