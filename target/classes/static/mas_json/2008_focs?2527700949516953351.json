Our result is obtained via a new approach of building \"highways\" between portals and a new strong diameter probabilistic decomposition theorem.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Ittai Abraham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abraham:Ittai", "Yair Bartal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartal:Yair", "Ofer Neiman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neiman:Ofer"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
