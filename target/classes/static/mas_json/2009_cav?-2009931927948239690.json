Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) are a widely used modeling formalism, where performance and dependability properties are analyzable by model checking. We present  INFAMY  , a model checker for arbitrarily structured infinite-state CTMCs. It checks probabilistic timing properties expressible in continuous stochastic logic (CSL). Conventional model checkers explore the given model exhaustively, which is often costly, due to state explosion, and impossible if the model is infinite.  INFAMY  only explores the model up to a finite depth, with the depth bound being computed  on-the-fly  . The computation of depth bounds is configurable to adapt to the characteristics of different classes of models.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ernst Moritz Hahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hahn:Ernst_Moritz", "Holger Hermanns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hermanns:Holger", "Bj\u00f6rn Wachter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wachter:Bj=ouml=rn", "Lijun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lijun"], "pages": 7}
