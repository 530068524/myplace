{"title": "A Relaxed Ranking-Based Factor Model for Recommender System from Implicit Feedback.", "fields": ["recommender system", "ranking", "factor analysis", "pairwise comparison", "negative feedback"], "abstract": "Implicit feedback based recommendation has recently been an important task with the accumulated user-item interaction data. However, it is very challenging to produce recommendations from implicit feedback due to the sparseness of data and the lack of negative feedback/rating. Although various factor models have been proposed to tackle this problem, they either focus on rating prediction that may lead to inaccurate top-k recommendations or are dependent on the sampling of negative feedback that often results in bias. To this end, we propose a Relaxed Ranking-based Factor Model, RRFM, to relax pairwise ranking into a SVM-like task, where positive and negative feedbacks are separated by the soft boundaries, and their non-separate property is employed to capture the characteristic of unobserved data. A smooth and scalable algorithm is developed to solve group- and instance- level's optimization and parameter estimation. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "Hefei University of Technology", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Nanjing University of Finance and Economics", "Hefei University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Huayu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Huayu", "Richang Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Richang", "Defu Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Defu", "Zhiang Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Zhiang", "Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Meng", "Yong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Yong"], "pages": 7}
