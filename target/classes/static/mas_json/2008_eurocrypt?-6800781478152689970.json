{"title": "A New Mode of Operation for Block Ciphers and Length-Preserving MACs.", "fields": ["residual block termination", "affine cipher", "ciphertext stealing", "mdc 2", "galois counter mode"], "abstract": "We propose a new mode of operation, enciphered CBC, for domain extension of length-preserving functions (like block ciphers), which is a variation on the popular CBC mode of operation. Our new mode is twice slower than CBC, but has many (property-preserving) properties not enjoyed by CBC and other known modes. Most notably, it yields the first constant-rate Variable Input Length (VIL) MAC from any length preserving Fixed Input Length (FIL) MAC. This answers the question of Dodis and Puniya from Eurocrypt 2007. Further, our mode is a secure domain extender for PRFs (with basically the same security as encrypted CBC). This provides a hedge against the security of the block cipher: if the block cipher is pseudorandom, one gets a VIL-PRF, while if it is \"only\" unpredictable, one \"at least\" gets a VIL-MAC. Additionally, our mode yields a VIL random oracle (and, hence, a collision-resistant hash function) when instantiated with length-preserving random functions, or even random permutations (which can be queried from both sides). This means that one does not have to re-key the block cipher during the computation, which was critically used in most previous constructions (analyzed in the ideal cipher model).", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "CWI Amsterdam,  ... he Netherlands"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Yevgeniy Dodis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dodis:Yevgeniy", "Krzysztof Pietrzak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietrzak:Krzysztof", "Prashant Puniya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Puniya:Prashant"], "pages": 22}
