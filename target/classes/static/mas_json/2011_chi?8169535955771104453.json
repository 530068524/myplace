We present an interview study of 20 individuals to determine how assistive technology use is affected by social and professional contexts and interactions. We found that specific assistive devices sometimes marked their users as having disabilities; that functional access took priority over feeling self-conscious when using assistive technologies; and that two misperceptions pervaded assistive technology use: (1) that assistive devices could functionally eliminate a disability, and (2) that people with disabilities would be helpless without their devices. Our findings provide further evidence that accessibility should be built into mainstream technologies. When this is not feasible, assistive devices should incorporate cutting edge technologies and strive to be designed for social acceptability, a new design approach we propose here.", "citation": "Citations (205)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kristen Shinohara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shinohara:Kristen", "Jacob O.
