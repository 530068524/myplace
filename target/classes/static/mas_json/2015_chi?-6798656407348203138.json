{"title": "STRATOS: Using Visualization to Support Decisions in Strategic Software Release Planning.", "fields": ["visualization", "information visualization", "qualitative research", "release management", "software release life cycle"], "abstract": "Software is typically developed incrementally and released in stages. Planning these releases involves deciding which features of the system should be implemented for each release. This is a complex planning process involving numerous trade-offs-constraints and factors that often make decisions difficult. Since the success of a product depends on this plan, it is important to understand the trade-offs between different release plans in order to make an informed choice. We present STRATOS, a tool that simultaneously visualizes several software release plans. The visualization shows several attributes about each plan that are important to planners. Multiple plans are shown in a single layout to help planners find and understand the trade-offs between alternative plans. We evaluated our tool via a qualitative study and found that STRATOS enables a range of decision-making processes, helping participants decide on which plan is most optimal.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Bon Adriel Aseniero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aseniero:Bon_Adriel", "Tiffany Wun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wun:Tiffany", "David Ledo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ledo:David", "Guenther Ruhe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruhe:Guenther", "Anthony Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Anthony", "Sheelagh Carpendale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carpendale:Sheelagh"], "pages": 10}
