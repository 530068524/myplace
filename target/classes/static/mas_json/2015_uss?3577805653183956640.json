{"title": "Verified Correctness and Security of OpenSSL HMAC.", "fields": ["functional specification", "mathematical proof", "toolchain", "hash based message authentication code", "proof assistant"], "abstract": "We have proved, with machine-checked proofs in Coq, that an OpenSSL implementation of HMAC with SHA- 256 correctly implements its FIPS functional specification and that its functional specification guarantees the expected cryptographic properties. This is the first machine-checked cryptographic proof that combines a source-program implementation proof, a compiler-correctness proof, and a cryptographic-security proof, with no gaps at the specification interfaces.\n\nThe verification was done using three systems within the Coq proof assistant: the Foundational Cryptography Framework, to verify crypto properties of functional specs; the Verified Software Toolchain, to verify C programs w.r.t. functional specs; and CompCert, for verified compilation of C to assembly language.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Lennart Beringer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beringer:Lennart", "Adam Petcher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petcher:Adam", "Katherine Q.
