While MIMO has been widely studied for single link transmission scenarios in physical layer as well as from MAC perspective, its impact on network layer, especially its interaction with routing has not drawn enough research attention. In this paper, we investigate the problem of routing in MIMO-based wireless mesh networks. We mathematically formulate the MIMO-enabled multi-source multi-destination multi-hop routing problem into a multi-commodity flow problem by identifying the specific opportunities and constraints brought by MIMO transmissions, in order to provide the fundamental basis for MIMO-aware routing design. We then use this formulation to develop a polynomial time approximation solution that maximizes the scaling factor for the concurrent flows in the network. Moreover, we also consider a more practical case where controllers are distributed, and propose a distributed algorithm to minimize the congestion in the network links based on steepest descent framework, which is proved to provide a fixed approximation ratio. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated through simulations and demonstrated to outperform the counterpart strategies without considering MIMO features.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Shan Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Shan", "Xin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Xin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
