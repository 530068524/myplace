{"title": "Nonparametric kernel estimators for image classification.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "contextual image classification", "cardinality", "discriminative model", "estimator"], "abstract": "We introduce a new discriminative learning method for image classification. We assume that the images are represented by unordered, multi-dimensional, finite sets of feature vectors, and that these sets might have different cardinality. This allows us to use consistent nonparametric divergence estimators to define new kernels over these sets, and then apply them in kernel classifiers. Our numerical results demonstrate that in many cases this approach can outperform state-of-the-art competitors on both simulated and challenging real-world datasets.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Barnab\u00e1s P\u00f3czos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=oacute=czos:Barnab=aacute=s", "Liang Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Liang", "Dougal J.
