As the fences\u2019 semantics may be subtle, the automation of their placement is highly desirable. But precise methods for restoring consistency do not scale to deployed systems\u2019 code. We choose to trade some precision for genuine scalability: our technique is suitable for large code bases. We implement it in our new musketeer tool and report experiments on more than 700 executables from packages found in Debian GNU/Linux 7.1, including memcached with about 10,000 LoC.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University College London", "University of Oxford", "Microsoft", "University of Oxford", "University College London", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Jade Alglave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alglave:Jade", "Daniel Kroening.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kroening:Daniel", "Vincent Nimal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nimal:Vincent", "Daniel Poetzl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poetzl:Daniel"], "pages": 17}
