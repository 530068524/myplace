{"title": "\"Will I always be not social?\": Re-Conceptualizing Sociality in the Context of a Minecraft Community for Autism.", "fields": ["social media", "categorization", "psychology", "developmental psychology", "metaverse", "autism", "sociality"], "abstract": "Traditional face-to-face social interactions can be challenging for individuals with autism, leading some to perceive and categorize them as less social than their typically-developing peers. Individuals with autism may even see themselves as less social relative to their peers. Online communities can provide an alternative venue for social expression, enabling different types of communication beyond face-to-face, oral interaction. Using ethnographic methods, we studied the communication ecology that has emerged around a Minecraft server for children with autism and their allies. Our analysis shows how members of this community search for, practice, and define sociality through a variety of communication channels. These findings suggest an expansion in how sociality has traditionally been conceptualized for individuals with autism.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Kathryn E.
