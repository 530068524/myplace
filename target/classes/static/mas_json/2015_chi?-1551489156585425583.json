{"title": "Crowdsourcing Synchronous Spectator Support: (go on, go on, you're the best)", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "athletes", "multimedia", "crowds", "social network"], "abstract": "Many studies have shown that crowd-support, such as cheering during sport events, can have a positive impact on athletes' performance. However, up until recently this support was only possible if the supporters and the athletes were geographically co-located. Can cheering be done remotely and would this be effective? In this paper we investigate the effect and possibilities of live remote cheering on co-located athletes and online supporting crowds that have a weak social tie and no social tie with the athlete. We recruit 140 online spectators and 5 athletes for an ad-hoc 5km road race. Results indicate that crowds socially closer to the athletes are significantly more engaged in the support. The athletes were excited by live remote cheering from friendsourced spectators and cheering from unknown crowdsourced participants indicating that remote friends and outsourced spectators could be an important source of support.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "RMIT University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Franco Curmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curmi:Franco", "Maria Angela Ferrario.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferrario:Maria_Angela", "Jon Whittle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittle:Jon", "Florian 'Floyd' Mueller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mueller:Florian_=Floyd="], "pages": 10}
