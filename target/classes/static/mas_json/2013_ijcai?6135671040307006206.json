As an efficient approach for consensus clustering, the K-means based method has garnered attention in the literature, but the existing research is still preliminary and fragmented. In this paper, we provide a systematic study on the framework of K-means-based Consensus Clustering (KCC). We first formulate the general definition of KCC, and then reveal a necessary and sufficient condition for utility functions that work for KCC, on both complete and incomplete basic partitionings. Experimental results on various real-world data sets demonstrate that KCC is highly efficient and is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality. In addition, KCC shows high robustness to incomplete basic partitionings with substantial missing values.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Rutgers University", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Junjie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Junjie", "Hongfu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hongfu", "Hui Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Hui", "Jie Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Jie"], "pages": 7}
