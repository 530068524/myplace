This paper presents a novel dictionary learning (DL) method to improve the pattern classification performance. Based on the Fisher discrimination criterion, a structured dictionary, whose dictionary atoms have correspondence to the class labels, is learned so that the reconstruction error after sparse coding can be used for pattern classification. Meanwhile, the Fisher discrimination criterion is imposed on the coding coefficients so that they have small within-class scatter but big between-class scatter. A new classification scheme associated with the proposed Fisher discrimination DL (FDDL) method is then presented by using both the discriminative information in the reconstruction error and sparse coding coefficients. The proposed FDDL is extensively evaluated on benchmark image databases in comparison with existing sparse representation and DL based classification methods.", "citation": "Citations (757)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Xidian University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Meng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Meng", "Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Lei", "Xiangchu Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Xiangchu", "David Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:David"], "pages": 8}
