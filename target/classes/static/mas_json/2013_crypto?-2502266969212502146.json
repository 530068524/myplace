An important question from both a practical and theoretical perspective is how small their parameters can be made, while preserving their hardness.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Daniele Micciancio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micciancio:Daniele", "Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 19}
