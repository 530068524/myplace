In this paper, we explore the energy benefits of reducing the GPU chip's voltage to the safe limit, i.e.  V min   point. We perform such a study on several commercial off-the-shelf GPU cards. We find that there exists about 20% voltage guardband on those GPUs spanning two architectural generations, which, if \"eliminated\" completely, can result in up to 25% energy savings on one of the studied GPU cards. The exact improvement magnitude depends on the program's available guardband, because our measurement results unveil a program dependent  V min   behavior across the studied programs. We make fundamental observations about the program-dependent  V min   behavior. We experimentally determine that the voltage noise has a larger impact on  V min   compared to the process and temperature variation, and the activities during the kernel execution cause large voltage droops. From these findings, we show how to use a kernel's microarchitectural performance counters to predict its  V min   value accurately. The average and maximum prediction errors are 0.5% and 3%, respectively. The accurate  V min   prediction opens up new possibilities of a cross-layer dynamic guardbanding scheme for GPUs, in which software predicts and manages the voltage guardband, while the functional correctness is ensured by a hardware safety net mechanism.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Jingwen Leng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leng:Jingwen", "Alper Buyuktosunoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buyuktosunoglu:Alper", "Ramon Bertran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertran:Ramon", "Pradip Bose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bose:Pradip", "Vijay Janapa Reddi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reddi:Vijay_Janapa"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2015", "pages": 14}
