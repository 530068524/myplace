{"title": "Name-ethnicity classification from open sources.", "fields": ["training set", "decision tree", "hidden markov model", "classifier", "news analytics"], "abstract": "The problem of ethnicity identification from names has a variety of important applications, including biomedical research, demographic studies, and marketing. Here we report on the development of an ethnicity classifier where all training data is extracted from public, non-confidential (and hence somewhat unreliable) sources. Our classifier uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) and decision trees to classify names into 13 cultural/ethnic groups with individual group accuracy comparable accuracy to earlier binary (e.g., Spanish/non-Spanish) classifiers. We have applied this classifier to over 20 million names from a large-scale news corpus, identifying interesting temporal and spatial trends on the representation of particular cultural/ethnic groups.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Anurag Ambekar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ambekar:Anurag", "Charles B.
