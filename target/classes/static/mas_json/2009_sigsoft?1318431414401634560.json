Existing fault tolerance (FT) mechanisms are typically defensive and reactive, thus unnecessarily costly. In this paper we propose a hybrid FT approach,  recovery aware component  (RAC), combining reactive and proactive FT, with failure recovery or aversion of user-defined granularity, by component-orientation and architecture-level reasoning about FT, to increase reliability and availability without needless performance sacrifices. We model and analyse a parameterised RAC implementation combining prediction, proactive rejuvenation and reactive restarting to varying extents, calculating cost savings, reliability improvements and cost-benefit, under parameters such as prediction frequency and accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["RMIT University", "RMIT University", "RMIT University"], "authors": ["Iman I.
