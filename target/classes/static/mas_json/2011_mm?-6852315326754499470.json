The basic idea is to expand a visual word in the query image with its synonyms to boost the retrieval recall. Unlike the existing work such as soft-quantization, which only focuses on the Euclidean ( l  2 ) distance in descriptor space, we utilize the visual words which are more likely to describe visual objects with the same semantic meaning by identifying the words with similar contextual distributions ( i.e.  contextual synonyms). We describe the contextual distribution of a visual word using the statistics of both co-occurrence and spatial information averaged over all the image patches having this visual word, and propose an efficient system implementation to construct the contextual synonym dictionary for a large visual vocabulary. The whole construction process is unsupervised and the synonym dictionary can be naturally integrated into a standard bag-of-feature image retrieval system. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets are quite promising. The contextual synonym dictionary-based expansion consistently outperforms the  l  2  distance-based soft-quantization, and advances the state-of-the-art performance remarkably.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Wenbin Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Wenbin", "Rui Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Rui", "Zhiwei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhiwei", "Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lei"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
