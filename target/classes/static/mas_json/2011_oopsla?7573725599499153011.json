{"title": "Enhancing locality for recursive traversals of recursive structures.", "fields": ["tree traversal", "pointer", "existential quantification", "locality of reference", "recursion"], "abstract": "While there has been decades of work on developing automatic, locality-enhancing transformations for regular programs that operate over dense matrices and arrays, there has been little investigation of such transformations for irregular programs, which operate over pointer-based data structures such as graphs, trees and lists. In this paper, we argue that, for a class of irregular applications we call traversal codes, there exists substantial data reuse and hence opportunity for locality exploitation. We develop a novel optimization called point blocking, inspired by the classic tiling loop transformation, and show that it can substantially enhance temporal locality in traversal codes. We then present a transformation and optimization framework called TreeTiler that automatically detects opportunities for applying point blocking and applies the transformation. TreeTiler uses autotuning techniques to determine appropriate parameters for the transformation. For a series of traversal algorithms drawn from real-world applications, we show that TreeTiler is able to deliver performance improvements of up to 245% over an optimized (but non-transformed) parallel baseline, and in several cases, significantly better scalability.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Youngjoon Jo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jo:Youngjoon", "Milind Kulkarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulkarni_0001:Milind"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2011", "pages": 20}
