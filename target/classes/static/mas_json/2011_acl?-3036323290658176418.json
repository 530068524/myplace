Improving G2P with transliterations.", "fields": ["speech recognition", "pronunciation", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P) of names is an important and challenging problem. The correct pronunciation of a name is often reflected in its transliterations, which are expressed within a different phonological inventory. We investigate the problem of using transliterations to correct errors produced by state-of-the-art G2P systems. We present a novel re-ranking approach that incorporates a variety of score and n-gram features, in order to leverage transliterations from multiple languages. Our experiments demonstrate significant accuracy improvements when re-ranking is applied to n-best lists generated by three different G2P programs.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Aditya Bhargava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhargava:Aditya", "Grzegorz Kondrak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kondrak:Grzegorz"], "pages": 10}
