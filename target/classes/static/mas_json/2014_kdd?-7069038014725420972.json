{"title": "Activity ranking in LinkedIn feed.", "fields": ["ranking", "machine learning", "systems architecture", "ranging", "social network"], "abstract": "Users on an online social network site generate a large number of heterogeneous activities, ranging from connecting with other users, to sharing content, to updating their profiles. The set of activities within a user's network neighborhood forms a stream of updates for the user's consumption. In this paper, we report our experience with the problem of ranking activities in the LinkedIn homepage feed. In particular, we provide a taxonomy of social network activities, describe a system architecture (with a number of key components open-sourced) that supports fast iteration in model development, demonstrate a number of key factors for effective ranking, and report experimental results from extensive online bucket tests.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["LinkedIn", "LinkedIn", "LinkedIn", "LinkedIn", "LinkedIn"], "authors": ["Deepak Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Deepak", "Bee-Chung Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bee=Chung", "Rupesh Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Rupesh", "Joshua Hartman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartman:Joshua", "Qi He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Qi", "Anand Iyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iyer:Anand", "Sumanth Kolar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolar:Sumanth", "Yiming Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Yiming", "Pannagadatta Shivaswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shivaswamy:Pannagadatta", "Ajit Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Ajit", "Liang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Liang"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
