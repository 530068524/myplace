{"title": "An unsupervised topic segmentation model incorporating word order.", "fields": ["approximate inference", "document clustering", "word order", "document classification", "topic model"], "abstract": "We present a new unsupervised topic discovery model for a collection of text documents. In contrast to the majority of the state-of-the-art topic models, our model does not break the document's structure such as paragraphs and sentences. In addition, it preserves word order in the document. As a result, it can generate two levels of topics of different granularity, namely, segment-topics and word-topics. In addition, it can generate n-gram words in each topic. We also develop an approximate inference scheme using Gibbs sampling method. We conduct extensive experiments using publicly available data from different collections and show that our model improves the quality of several text mining tasks such as the ability to support fine grained topics with n-gram words in the correlation graph, the ability to segment a document into topically coherent sections, document classification, and document likelihood estimation.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Shoaib Jameel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jameel:Shoaib", "Wai Lam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lam:Wai"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
