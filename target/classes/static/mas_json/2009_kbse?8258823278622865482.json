{"title": "A Holistic Approach to Mobile Service Provisioning.", "fields": ["mobile web", "provisioning", "mobile business development", "mobile technology", "mobile search"], "abstract": "Mobile service provisioning is concerned with enabling handheld devices, such as phones and PDAs, to host services. This naturally raises significant challenges that stem from mobile devices' inherent mobility and limited resources. Furthermore, mobile services tend to operate in dynamic, insecure and heterogeneous operating environments. The aim of our research is to develop a novel toolkit for constructing mobile services that addresses such challenges. In getting started, we have taken a middleware-based approach that mediates interaction between clients and mobile services. This work offers a foundation upon which we intend to build using techniques that fall within the domain of automated software engineering.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Auckland"], "authors": ["Andrew John Dennis Meads.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meads:Andrew_John_Dennis"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
