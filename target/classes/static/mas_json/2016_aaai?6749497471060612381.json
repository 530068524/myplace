{"title": "Labeling the Semantic Roles of Commas.", "fields": ["syntax", "punctuation", "semantic role labeling", "semantics", "sentence"], "abstract": "Commas and the surrounding sentence structure often express relations that are essential to understanding the meaning of the sentence. This paper proposes a set of relations commas participate in, expanding on previous work in this area, and develops a new dataset annotated with this set of labels. We identify features that are important to achieve a good performance on comma labeling and then develop a machine learning method that achieves high accuracy on identifying comma relations, improving over previous work. Finally, we discuss a variety of possible uses, both as syntactic and discourse-oriented features and constraints for downstream tasks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Naveen Arivazhagan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arivazhagan:Naveen", "Christos Christodoulopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Christodoulopoulos:Christos", "Dan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Dan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
