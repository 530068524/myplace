First, events are extracted from news text, and represented as dense vectors, trained using a novel neural tensor network. Second, a deep convolutional neural network is used to model both short-term and long-term influences of events on stock price movements. Experimental results show that our model can achieve nearly 6% improvements on S&P 500 index prediction and individual stock prediction, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods. In addition, market simulation results show that our system is more capable of making profits than previously reported systems trained on S&P 500 stock historical data.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Xiao Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Xiao", "Yue Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yue", "Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ting", "Junwen Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Junwen"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
