The device can be oriented in a variety of postures to support different nuances of individual work, ambient display, or collaboration with another user. In the context of a pen-operated note taking application, we demonstrate interaction techniques that support a fluid division of labor for tasks and information across the two displays while minimizing disruption to the primary experience of authoring notes.", "citation": "Citations (120)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ken Hinckley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hinckley:Ken", "Morgan Dixon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dixon:Morgan", "Raman Sarin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarin:Raman", "Fran\u00e7ois Guimbreti\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guimbreti=egrave=re:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Ravin Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Ravin"], "pages": 10}
