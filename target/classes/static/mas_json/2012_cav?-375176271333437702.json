Our previous work proposed to use nonstandard analysis (NSA) as a vehicle from discrete to hybrid; and to verify hybrid systems using a Hoare logic. In this paper we aim to exemplify the potential of our approach, through transferring static analysis techniques to hybrid applications. The transfer is routine via the transfer principle in NSA. The techniques are implemented in our prototype automatic precondition generator.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Kyoto University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ichiro Hasuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasuo:Ichiro", "Kohei Suenaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suenaga:Kohei"], "pages": 17}
