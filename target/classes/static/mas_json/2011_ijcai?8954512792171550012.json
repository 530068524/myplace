Our system dynamically enriches the PubMed search results displayed in a user's browser with semantic annotation provided by several natural language processing (NLP) subsystems, including a sentence splitter, a part-of-speech tagger, a named entity recognizer, a section categorizer and a gene normalizer (GN). After our system is installed, the PubMed search results page is modified on the fly to categorize sections and provide additional information on gene and gene products indentified by our NLP subsystems. In addition, GN involves three main steps: candidate ID matching, false positive filtering and disambiguation, which are highly dependent on each other. We propose a joint model using a Markov logic network (MLN) to model the dependencies found in GN. The experimental results show that our joint model outperforms a baseline system that executes the three steps separately.
