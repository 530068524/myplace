{"title": "New Algorithms and Lower Bounds for Monotonicity Testing.", "fields": ["parity function", "monotone polygon", "complexity index", "maximum satisfiability problem", "karp lipton theorem"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of testing whether an unknown Boolean function f : { -- 1, 1}n a#x21C6; { -- 1, 1} is monotone versus aepsi;-far from every monotone function. The two main results of this paper are a new lower bound and a new algorithm for this well-studied problem. Lower bound: We prove an a#x03A9;(n1/5) lower bound on the query complexity of any non-adaptive two-sided error algorithm for testing whether an unknown Boolean function f is monotone versus constant-far from monotone. This gives an exponential improvement on the previous lower bound of a#x03A9;(log n) due to Fischer et al.[1]. We show that the same lower bound holds for monotonicity testing of Boolean-valued functions over hypergrid domains {1,,m}n for all m age; 2. Upper bound: We present an O(n5/6) poly(1/aepsi;)-query algorithm that tests whether an unknown Boolean function f is monotone versus aepsi;-far from monotone. Our algorithm, which is non-adaptive and makes one-sided error, is a modified version of the algorithm of Chakrabarty and Seshadhri[2], which makes O(n7/8) poly(1/aepsi;) queries.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Xi", "Rocco A.
