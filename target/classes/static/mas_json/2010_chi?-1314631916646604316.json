Regression analysis suggests that employee behavior on social network sites (SNSs) reveals information about both professional and personal closeness. While some factors are predictive of general closeness (e.g. content recommendations), other factors signal that employees feel personal closeness towards their colleagues, but not professional closeness (e.g. mutual profile commenting). This analysis contributes to our understanding of how SNS behavior reflects relationship multiplexity: the multiple facets of our relationships with SNS connections.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Anna Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Anna", "Joan Morris DiMicco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DiMicco:Joan_Morris", "David R.
