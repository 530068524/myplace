Various definitions are proposed, including definitions that state that the system enforces as much of the policy as possible in the context of attacks in which groups of agents collude by sharing information through channels that lie outside the system. Relationships between the various definitions proposed are characterized, and an unwinding-based proof technique is developed. Finally, it is shown that on a specific class of systems, access control systems with local non-determinism, the strongest definition can be verified by checking a simple static property.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of Queensland"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Kai Engelhardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Engelhardt:Kai", "Ron van der Meyden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyden:Ron_van_der", "Chenyi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chenyi"], "pages": 12}
