However, manually designing ICs require experts and time, hence the need for automatic discovery. Previous automatic ICs discovery suffer from (1) limited ICs language expressiveness; and (2) time-consuming manual verification of discovered ICs. We introduce RULEMINER, a system for discovering data quality rules that addresses the limitations of existing solutions.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "authors": ["Xu Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Xu", "Ihab F.
