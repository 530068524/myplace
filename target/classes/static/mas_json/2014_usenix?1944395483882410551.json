{"title": "A Modular and Efficient Past State System for Berkeley DB.", "fields": ["audit", "novelty", "formal specification", "modular design", "database transaction"], "abstract": "Applications often need to analyze past states to predict trends and support audits. Adding efficient and nondisruptive support for consistent past-state analysis requires after-the-fact modification of the data store, a significant challenge for today's systems. This paper describes Retro, a new system for supporting consistent past state analysis in Berkeley DB. The key novelty of Retro is an efficient yet simple and robust implementation method, imposing 4% worst-case overhead. Unlike prior approaches, Retro protocols, backed by a formal specification, extend standard transaction protocols in a modular way, requiring minimal data store modification (about 250 lines of BDB code).", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Brandeis University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "NuoDB"], "authors": ["Ross Shaull.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shaull:Ross", "Liuba Shrira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrira:Liuba", "Barbara Liskov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liskov:Barbara"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
