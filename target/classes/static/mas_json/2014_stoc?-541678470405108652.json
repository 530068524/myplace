{"title": "Cops, robbers, and threatening skeletons: padded decomposition for minor-free graphs.", "fields": ["modular decomposition", "treewidth", "tree depth", "partial k tree", "pathwidth"], "abstract": "We prove that any graph excluding  K   r   as a minor has can be partitioned into clusters of diameter at most \u0394 while removing at most  O ( r/ \u0394) fraction of the edges. This improves over the results of Fakcharoenphol and Talwar, who building on the work of Klein, Plotkin and Rao gave a partitioning that required to remove  O ( r  2 /\u0394) fraction of the edges. Our result is obtained by a new approach that relates the topological properties (excluding a minor) of a graph to its geometric properties (the induced shortest path metric). Specifically, we show that techniques used by Andreae in his investigation of the cops and robbers game on graphs excluding a fixed minor, can be used to construct padded decompositions of the metrics induced by such graphs. In particular, we get probabilistic partitions with padding parameter  O ( r ) and strong-diameter partitions with padding parameter  O ( r  2 ) for  K   r  -free graphs,  O ( k ) for treewidth- k  graphs, and  O (log  g ) for graphs with genus  g .", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Bordeaux", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ittai Abraham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abraham:Ittai", "Cyril Gavoille.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavoille:Cyril", "Anupam Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Anupam", "Ofer Neiman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neiman:Ofer", "Kunal Talwar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talwar:Kunal"], "pages": 10}
