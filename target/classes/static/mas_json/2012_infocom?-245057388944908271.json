Untrained users typically purchase, install, and configure a home AP with very little awareness of wireless signal coverage and complex interference conditions. We envision a future of autonomous wireless network management that uses the Internet as an enabling technology. By leveraging a P2P architecture over wired Internet connections, nearby APs can coordinate to manage their shared wireless spectrum, especially in the face of network-crippling faults. As a specific instance of this architecture, we build RxIP, a network diagnostic and recovery tool, initially targeted towards hidden terminal mitigation. Our stable, in-kernel implementation demonstrates that APs in real home settings can detect hidden interferers, and agree on a mutually beneficial channel access strategy. Consistent throughput and fairness gains with TCP traffic and in-home micro-mobility confirm the viability of the system. We believe that using RxIP to address other network deficiencies opens a rich area for further research, helping to ensure that smarter homes of the future embed smarter networks. In the near term, with the wireless and entertainment industries poised for home-centric wireless gadgets, RxIP-type home management systems will become increasingly relevant.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Justin Manweiler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manweiler:Justin", "Peter Franklin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Franklin:Peter", "Romit Roy Choudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhury:Romit_Roy"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
