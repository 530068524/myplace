However, current metrics of flexibility ignore domain knowledge about how such constraints might arise in practice, e.g., due to the uncertain duration of a robot's transition time from one location to another. Probabilistic temporal planning accounts for actions whose uncertain durations can be modeled with probability density functions. We introduce a new metric called robustness that measures the likelihood of success for probabilistic temporal plans. We show empirically that in multi-robot planning, robustness may be a better metric for assessing the quality of temporal plans than flexibility, thus reframing many popular scheduling optimization problems.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Harvey Mudd College", "Harvey Mudd College", "Harvey Mudd College", "Harvey Mudd College"], "authors": ["Jeb Brooks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brooks:Jeb", "Emilia Reed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reed:Emilia", "Alexander Gruver.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gruver:Alexander", "James C.
