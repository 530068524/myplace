The overall system dynamics emerges from the interaction among physical dynamics, computational dynamics, and communication networks. Network uncertainties such as time-varying delay and packet loss cause significant challenges. This paper proposes a passive control architecture for designing wireless networked control systems that are insensitive to network uncertainties. We describe the architecture for a system consisting of a robotic manipulator controlled by a digital controller over a wireless network and we show that the system is stable even in the presence of time-varying delays. We present simulation results that demonstrate the advantages of the architecture with respect to stability and performance and show that the system is insensitive to network uncertainties.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Vanderbilt University", "University of Notre", "University of Notre", "University of Notre", "University of Notre"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Nicholas Kottenstette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kottenstette:Nicholas", "Xenofon D.
