{"title": "Faster Algorithms for Solving LPN.", "fields": ["hamming bound", "compromise", "cryptography", "embedding", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "The LPN problem, lying at the core of many cryptographic constructions for lightweight and post-quantum cryptography, receives quite a lot attention recently. The best published algorithm for solving it at Asiacrypt 2014 improved the classical BKW algorithm by using covering codes, which claimed to marginally compromise the 80-bit security of HB variants, LPN-C and Lapin. In this paper, we develop faster algorithms for solving LPN based on an optimal precise embedding of cascaded concrete perfect codes, in a similar framework but with many optimizations. Our algorithm outperforms the previous methods for the proposed parameter choices and distinctly break the 80-bit security bound of the instances suggested in cryptographic schemes like HB$$^+$$+, HB$$^\\#$&#, LPN-C and Lapin.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Bin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Bin", "Lin Jiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiao:Lin", "Mingsheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Mingsheng"], "pages": 28}
