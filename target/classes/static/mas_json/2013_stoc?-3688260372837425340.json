{"title": "Coevolutionary opinion formation games.", "fields": ["intrinsic value", "price of anarchy", "smoothness", "generalization", "social cost"], "abstract": "We present game-theoretic models of opinion formation in social networks where opinions themselves  co-evolve  with friendships. In these models, nodes form their opinions by maximizing agreements with friends weighted by the strength of the relationships, which in turn depend on difference in opinion with the respective friends. We define a social cost of this process by generalizing recent work of Bindel  et al. , FOCS 2011. We tightly bound the price of anarchy of the resulting dynamics via local smoothness arguments, and characterize it as a function of how much nodes value their own (intrinsic) opinion, as well as how strongly they weigh links to friends with whom they agree more.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Microsoft", "Duke University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Kshipra Bhawalkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhawalkar:Kshipra", "Sreenivas Gollapudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollapudi:Sreenivas", "Kamesh Munagala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munagala:Kamesh"], "pages": 10}
