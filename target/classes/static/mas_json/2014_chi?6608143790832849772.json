By using the initially applied pressure level for implicit mode switching, a gesture can be enhanced with different functionalities to enlarge the interaction space for multi-touch. To evaluate the feasibility of our concept, we conducted an experiment, which indicates good human sensorimotor skills for performing multi-touch gestures with a few number of pressure levels and without any additional feedback. Based on the experimental results, we discuss implications for the design of pressure-sensitive multi-touch gestures, and propose application scenarios that make optimal use of our concept.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of A ... enberg, Austria", "University of A ... ustria, Austria", "University of A ... enberg, Austria", "University of A ... ustria, Austria", "University of A ... ustria, Austria"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christian Rendl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rendl:Christian", "Patrick Greindl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greindl:Patrick", "Kathrin Probst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Probst:Kathrin", "Martin Behrens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Behrens:Martin", "Michael Haller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haller:Michael"], "pages": 4}
