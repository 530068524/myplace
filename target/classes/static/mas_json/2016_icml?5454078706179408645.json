We approach this problem from first principles and formulate it as a surprisingly simple optimization problem. Indeed, our formulation even admits a closed form solution. This solution possesses several very attractive properties: (i) an innate geometric appeal through the Riemannian geometry of positive definite matrices; (ii) ease of interpretability; and (iii) computational speed several orders of magnitude faster than the widely used LMNN and ITML methods. Furthermore, on standard benchmark datasets, our closed-form solution consistently attains higher classification accuracy.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Tehran", "University of Tehran", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Tianjin University", "Tianjin University", "Tianjin University", "University of Surrey", "Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Pourya Zadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zadeh:Pourya", "Reshad Hosseini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosseini:Reshad", "Suvrit Sra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sra:Suvrit"], "pages": 8}
