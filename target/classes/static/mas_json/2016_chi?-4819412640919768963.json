{"title": "App Movement: A Platform for Community Commissioning of Mobile Applications.", "fields": ["liability", "project commissioning", "personalization", "software deployment", "user generated content"], "abstract": "There is an increasing demand to encourage inclusivity in the design of digital services. In response to this issue we have created App Movement, a platform that enables the promotion, collaborative design, and deployment of community-commissioned mobile applications. The platform facilitates collaborative customization of a common app template, for which the development and deployment of the app is fully automated. We describe the motivation, design and implementation of App Movement, and report the findings from an 8 month deployment wherein 27 campaigns were created, 11 of which have been successful, and over 1,600 users pledged their support using the platform. We present three case studies to demonstrate its use and adoption in successful and unsuccessful campaigns. We discuss the implications of these studies, including questions of governance (ownership of content, liability of user generated content and moderation), sustainability and the potential to extend App Movement beyond location-based review apps.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Andrew Thomas Garbett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garbett:Andrew_Thomas", "Rob Comber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Comber:Rob", "Edward Jenkins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jenkins:Edward", "Patrick Olivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivier:Patrick"], "pages": 12}
