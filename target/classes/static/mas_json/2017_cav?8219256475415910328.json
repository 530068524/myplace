{"title": "Program Verification Under Weak Memory Consistency Using Separation Logic.", "fields": ["hardware architecture", "strong consistency", "high level verification", "software verification", "sequential consistency"], "abstract": "The semantics of concurrent programs is now defined by a weak memory model, determined either by the programming language (e.g., in the case of C/C++11 or Java) or by the hardware architecture (e.g., for assembly and legacy C code). Since most work in concurrent software verification has been developed prior to weak memory consistency, it is natural to ask how these models affect formal reasoning about concurrent programs.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["MPI-SWS"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Viktor Vafeiadis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vafeiadis:Viktor"], "pages": 17}
