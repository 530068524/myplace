These proofs formalize the originalargument of Bellare and Rogaway, and an optimal reduction by Coronthat provides a tighter bound on the probability of a forgery. Bothproofs are developed using CertiCrypt, a general framework toformalize exact security proofs of cryptographic systems in thecomputational model. Since CertiCrypt is implemented on top of theCoq proof assistant, the proofs are highly trustworthy and can beverified independently and fully automatically.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "IMDEA"], "authors": ["Santiago Zanella B\u00e9guelin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=eacute=guelin:Santiago_Zanella", "Gilles Barthe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthe:Gilles", "Benjamin Gr\u00e9goire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=eacute=goire:Benjamin", "Federico Olmedo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olmedo:Federico"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2009", "pages": 14}
