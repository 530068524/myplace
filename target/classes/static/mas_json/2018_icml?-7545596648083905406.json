{"title": "Been There, Done That: Meta-Learning with Episodic Recall.", "fields": ["working memory", "formalism", "episodic memory", "metalearning", "ranging"], "abstract": "Meta-learning agents excel at rapidly learning new tasks from open-ended task distributions; yet, they forget what they learn about each task as soon as the next begins. When tasks reoccur - as they do in natural environments - metalearning agents must explore again instead of immediately exploiting previously discovered solutions. We propose a formalism for generating open-ended yet repetitious environments, then develop a meta-learning architecture for solving these environments. This architecture melds the standard LSTM working memory with a differentiable neural episodic memory. We explore the capabilities of agents with this episodic LSTM in five meta-learning environments with reoccurring tasks, ranging from bandits to navigation and stochastic sequential decision problems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["DeepMind", "DeepMind", "DeepMind", "DeepMind", "DeepMind"], "authors": ["Samuel Ritter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ritter:Samuel", "Jane X.
