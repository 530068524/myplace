{"title": "Real-Time Bidding with Side Information.", "fields": ["real time bidding", "bidding", "regret", "time horizon", "knapsack problem"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of repeated bidding in online advertising auctions when some side information (e.g. browser cookies) is available ahead of submitting a bid in the form of a $d$-dimensional vector. The goal for the advertiser is to maximize the total utility (e.g. the total number of clicks) derived from displaying ads given that a limited budget $B$ is allocated for a given time horizon $T$. Optimizing the bids is modeled as a contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem with a knapsack constraint and a continuum of arms. We develop UCB-type algorithms that combine two streams of literature: the confidence-set approach to linear contextual MABs and the probabilistic bisection search method for stochastic root-finding. Under mild assumptions on the underlying unknown distribution, we establish distribution-independent regret bounds of order $\\tilde{O}(d \\cdot \\sqrt{T})$ when either $B = \\infty$ or when $B$ scales linearly with $T$.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Arthur Flajolet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flajolet:Arthur", "Patrick Jaillet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaillet:Patrick"], "pages": 11}
