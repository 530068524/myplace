Inspired by the tree structure used in PS, the proposed Active Pictorial Structures (APS) 1  model the appearance of the object using multiple graph-based pairwise normal distributions (Gaussian Markov Random Field) between the patches extracted from the regions around adjacent landmarks. We show that this formulation is more accurate than using a single multivariate distribution (Principal Component Analysis) as commonly done in the literature. APS employ a weighted inverse compositional Gauss-Newton optimization with fixed Jacobian and Hessian that achieves close to real-time performance and state-of-the-art results. Finally, APS have a spring-like graph-based deformation prior term that makes them robust to bad initializations. We present extensive experiments on the task of face alignment, showing that APS outperform current state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first weighted inverse compositional technique that proves to be so accurate and efficient at the same time.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Epameinondas Antonakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antonakos:Epameinondas", "Joan Alabort-i-Medina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alabort=i=Medina:Joan", "Stefanos Zafeiriou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zafeiriou:Stefanos"], "pages": 10}
