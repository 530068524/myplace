However, it is a challenge to perform the sampling efficiently, while generating a diverse set of inputs which satisfy the constraints. We developed a new algorithm Q uick S ampler  which requires a small number of solver calls to produce millions of samples which satisfy the constraints with high probability. We evaluate Q uick S ampler  on large real-world benchmarks and show that it can produce unique valid solutions orders of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art sampling tools, with a distribution which is reasonably close to uniform in practice.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "authors": ["Rafael Dutra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dutra:Rafael", "Kevin Laeufer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laeufer:Kevin", "Jonathan Bachrach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bachrach:Jonathan", "Koushik Sen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sen:Koushik"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
