{"title": "Early Detection of Topical Expertise in Community Question Answering.", "fields": ["data mining", "question answering", "expertise finding", "stack overflow", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "We focus on detecting potential topical experts in community question answering platforms early on in their lifecycle. We use a semi-supervised machine learning approach. We extract three types of feature: (i) textual, (ii) behavioral, and (iii) time-aware, which we use to predict whether a user will become an expert in the longterm. We compare our method to a machine learning method based on a state-of-the-art method in expertise retrieval. Results on data from Stack Overflow demonstrate the utility of adding behavioral and time-aware features to the baseline method with a net improvement in accuracy of 26% for very early detection of expertise.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Hogeschool van Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "904Labs, Amster ... am, Netherlands"], "authors": ["David van Dijk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dijk:David_van", "Manos Tsagkias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsagkias:Manos", "Maarten de Rijke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rijke:Maarten_de"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
