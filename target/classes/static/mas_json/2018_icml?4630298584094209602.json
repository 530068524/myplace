{"title": "Cut-Pursuit Algorithm for Regularizing Nonsmooth Functionals with Graph Total Variation.", "fields": ["vertex", "mathematical proof", "regularization", "separable space", "heuristic"], "abstract": "We present an extension of the cut-pursuit algorithm, introduced by Landrieu and Obozinski (2017), to the graph total-variation regularization of functions with a separable nondifferentiable part. We propose a modified algorithmic scheme as well as adapted proofs of convergence. We also present a heuristic approach for handling the cases in which the values associated to each vertex of the graph are multidimensional. The performance of our algorithm, which we demonstrate on difficult, ill-conditioned large-scale inverse and learning problems, is such that it may in practice extend the scope of application of the total-variation regularization.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "IGN"], "authors": ["Hugo Raguet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raguet:Hugo", "Lo\u00efc Landrieu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Landrieu:Lo=iuml=c"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
