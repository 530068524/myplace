We extend the idea of approximate inference to the t-exponential family by defining a new t-divergence. This divergence measure is obtained via convex duality between the log-partition function of the t-exponential family and a new t-entropy. We illustrate our approach on the Bayes Point Machine with a Student's t-prior.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Nan Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Nan", "S.
