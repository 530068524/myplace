Each update to the graph is either an edge deletion or an edge insertion. We give the first randomized data structure that simultaneously achieves a constant approximation factor and handles a sequence of K updates in K*polylog(n) time, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. Previous data structures require a polynomial amount of computation per update.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Krzysztof Onak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onak:Krzysztof", "Ronitt Rubinfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubinfeld:Ronitt"], "pages": 8}
