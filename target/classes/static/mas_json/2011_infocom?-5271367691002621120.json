We study the worst outage probability problem under Rayleigh fading. As a by-product, we solve an open problem of convergence for a previously proposed algorithm in the interference-limited case. We then address a total power minimization problem with outage specification constraints and its feasibility condition. We propose a dynamic algorithm that adapts the outage probability specification in a heterogeneous network to minimize the total energy consumption and simultaneously guarantees all the femtocell users a min-max fairness in terms of the worst outage probability.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Chee Wei Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan_0001:Chee_Wei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
