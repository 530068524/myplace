{"title": "Posted Prices Exchange for Display Advertising Contracts.", "fields": ["impression", "marketing", "machine learning", "supply and demand", "display advertising"], "abstract": "We propose a new market design for display advertising contracts, based on posted prices. Our model and algorithmic framework address several major challenges: (i) the space of possible impression types is exponential in the number of attributes, which is typically large, therefore a complete price space cannot be maintained; (ii) advertisers are usually unable or reluctant to provide extensive demand (willingness-to-pay) functions, (iii) the levels of detail with which supply and demand are specified are often not identical.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yagil Engel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Engel:Yagil", "Moshe Tennenholtz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tennenholtz:Moshe"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
