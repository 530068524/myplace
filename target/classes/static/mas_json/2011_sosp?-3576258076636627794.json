{"title": "PTask: operating system abstractions to manage GPUs as compute devices.", "fields": ["dataflow", "temporal isolation among virtual machines", "dataflow programming", "general purpose computing on graphics processing units", "cuda"], "abstract": "We propose a new set of OS abstractions to support GPUs and other accelerator devices as first class computing resources. These new abstractions, collectively called the  PTask API , support a dataflow programming model. Because a PTask graph consists of OS-managed objects, the kernel has sufficient visibility and control to provide system-wide guarantees like fairness and performance isolation, and can streamline data movement in ways that are impossible under current GPU programming models.   Our experience developing the PTask API, along with a gestural interface on Windows 7 and a FUSE-based encrypted file system on Linux show that the PTask API can provide important system-wide guarantees where there were previously none, and can enable significant performance improvements, for example gaining a 5\u00d7 improvement in maximum throughput for the gestural interface.", "citation": "Citations (218)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Christopher J.
