Monitoring and mining BGP update messages can directly reveal the health and stability of Internet routing. Here we make two contributions: firstly we find patterns in BGP updates, like self-similarity, power-law and lognormal marginals; secondly using these patterns, we find anomalies. Specifically, we develop BGP-lens, an automated BGP updates analysis tool, that has three desirable properties: (a) It is  effective , able to identify phenomena that would otherwise go unnoticed, such as a peculiar 'clothesline' behavior or prolonged 'spikes' that last as long as 8 hours; (b) It is  scalable , using algorithms are all linear on the number of time-ticks; and (c) It is  admin-friendly , giving useful leads for phenomenon of interest.   We showcase the capabilities of  BGP-lens  by identifying surprising phenomena verified by syadmins, over a massive trace of BGP updates spanning 2 years, from the publicly available site datapository.net.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Riverside", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Riverside", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["B.
