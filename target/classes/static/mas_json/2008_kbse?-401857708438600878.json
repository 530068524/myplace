This increase in capability is based on algorithmic advances, but in no small measure it is also made possible by increases in processing speed and main memory sizes on standard desktop systems. For the time being, though, the increase in CPU speeds has mostly ended as chip-makers are redirecting their efforts to the development of multi-core systems. In the coming years we can expect systems with very large memory sizes, and increasing numbers of CPU cores, but with each core running at a relatively low speed. We will discuss the implications of this important trend, and describe how we can leverage these developments with new tools.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "University of Liverpool", "University of the West of England", "University of Liverpool", "University of Liverpool", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Science Applications International Corporation", "Science Applications International Corporation", "Goddard Space Flight Center", "Goddard Space Flight Center", "Goddard Space Flight Center", "University of Liverpool", "University of the West of England", "University of Liverpool", "United Technologies", "United Technologies", "Livonia, USA", "AIMdyn"], "authors": ["Gerard J.
