However, their performance is still unsatisfactory on random k-SAT at the phase transition, which is of significance and is one of the empirically hardest distributions of SAT instances. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic called DCCA, which combines two configuration checking (CC) strategies with different definitions of configuration in a novel way. We use the DCCA heuristic to design an efficient SLS solver for SAT dubbed DCCASat. The experiments show that the DCCASat solver significantly outperforms a number of state-of-the-art solvers on extensive random k-SAT benchmarks at the phase transition. Moreover, DCCASat shows good performance on structured benchmarks, and a combination of DCCASat with a complete solver achieves state-of-the-art performance on structured benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Chuan Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Chuan", "Shaowei Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Shaowei", "Wei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Wei", "Kaile Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Kaile"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
