{"title": "Skeleton automata for FPGAs: reconfiguring without reconstructing.", "fields": ["xpath", "stream processing", "xquery", "compromise", "skeleton"], "abstract": "While the performance opportunities of  field-programmable gate arrays field (FPGAs) field for high-volume query processing are well-known, system makers still have to compromise between desired query expressiveness and high compilation effort. The cost of the latter is the primary limitation in building efficient FPGA/CPU hybrids.   In this work we report on an FPGA-based stream processing engine that does not have this limitation. We provide a hardware implementation of  XML projection  [14] that can be reconfigured in less than a micro-second, yet supports a rich and expressive dialect of XPath. By performing XML projection  in the network , we can fully leverage its filtering effect and improve XQuery performance by several factors.   These improvements are made possible by a new design approach for FPGA acceleration, called  skeleton automata . Skeleton automata separate the structure of finite-state automata from their semantics. Since individual queries only affect the latter, with our approach query workload changes can be accommodated fast and with high expressiveness.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jens Teubner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teubner:Jens", "Louis Woods.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woods:Louis", "Chongling Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Chongling"], "pages": 12}
