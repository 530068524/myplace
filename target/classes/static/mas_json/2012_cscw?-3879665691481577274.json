{"title": "Towards multi-domain collaborative toolkits.", "fields": ["post wimp", "user interface toolkit", "process architecture", "end user", "retargeting"], "abstract": "A multi-domain collaboration toolkit hides heterogeneity of user-interface toolkits and associated domains from both programmers and end users of collaborative, widget-synchronizing, applications. We have developed such a system for the stand-alone, Eclipse, and web domains; and the AWT, Swing, SWT, and GWT single-user toolkits associated with these domains. Several new concepts are supported to meet these requirements including a widget server allowing a distributed widget client to manipulate widgets on an interactive device, flexible widget synchronization, flexible placement of widget listeners, \"piping\" centralized non-interactive replicas communicating with interactive user replicas, factory-based retargeting of the user-interface toolkit, and a new process architecture.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Jacob W.
