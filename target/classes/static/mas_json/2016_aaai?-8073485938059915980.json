{"title": "Using Correlated Strategies for Computing Stackelberg Equilibria in Extensive-Form Games.", "fields": ["extensive form game", "best response", "stackelberg competition", "fundamental solution", "correlated equilibrium"], "abstract": "Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) is a fundamental solution concept in game theory in which one player commits to a strategy, while the other player observes this commitment and plays a best response. We present a new algorithm for computing SSE for two-player extensive-form general-sum games with imperfect information (EFGs) where computing SSE is an NP-hard problem. Our algorithm is based on a correlated version of SSE, known as Stackelberg Extensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium (SEFCE). Our contribution is therefore twofold: (1) we give the first linear program for computing SEFCE in EFGs without chance, (2) we repeatedly solve and modify this linear program in a systematic search until we arrive to SSE. Our new algorithm outperforms the best previous algorithms by several orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "University of Texas at El Paso"], "authors": ["Jiri Cermak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cermak:Jiri", "Branislav Bosansk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosansk=yacute=:Branislav", "Karel Durkota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durkota:Karel", "Viliam Lis\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lis=yacute=:Viliam", "Christopher Kiekintveld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiekintveld:Christopher"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
