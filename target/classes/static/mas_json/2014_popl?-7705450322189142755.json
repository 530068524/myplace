The calculus is intended to capture the essence of contextual interactions of Middleweight Java code. Using game semantics, we provide fully abstract models for the induced notions of contextual approximation and equivalence. These are the first denotational models of this kind.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "Queen Mary University of London"], "authors": ["Andrzej S.
