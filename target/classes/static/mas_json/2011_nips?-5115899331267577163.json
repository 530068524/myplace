Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) plan policies for single agents under uncertainty and their decentralized versions (DEC-POMDPs) find a policy for multiple agents. The policy in infinite-horizon POMDP and DEC-POMDP problems has been represented as finite state controllers (FSCs). We introduce a novel class of periodic FSCs, composed of layers connected only to the previous and next layer. Our periodic FSC method finds a deterministic finite-horizon policy and converts it to an initial periodic infinite-horizon policy. This policy is optimized by a new infinite-horizon algorithm to yield deterministic periodic policies, and by a new expectation maximization algorithm to yield stochastic periodic policies. Our method yields better results than earlier planning methods and can compute larger solutions than with regular FSCs.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"], "authors": ["Nati Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nati", "Karthik Sridharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sridharan:Karthik", "Ambuj Tewari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tewari:Ambuj"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
