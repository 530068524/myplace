The problem has been the focus of much of the research at the intersection of Web search and machine learning, and learning ranking functions from preference data in particular has recently attracted much interest. The objective of this paper is to empirically examine several objective functions that can be used for learning ranking functions from preference data. Specifically, we investigate the roles of ties in the learning process. By ties, we mean preference judgments that two documents have equal degree of relevance with respect to a query. This type of data has largely been ignored or not properly modeled in the past. In this paper, we analyze the properties of ties and develop novel learning frameworks which combine ties and preference data using statistical paired comparison models to improve the performance of learned ranking functions. The resulting optimization problems explicitly incorporating ties and preference data are solved using gradient boosting methods. Experimental studies are conducted using three publicly available data sets which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new methods.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Ke Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0002:Ke", "Gui-Rong Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Gui=Rong", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan", "Yong Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yong"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
