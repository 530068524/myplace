{"title": "The Complexity of Playing Durak.", "fields": ["perfect information", "computer science", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "Durak is a Russian card game in which players try to get rid of all their cards via a particular attack/ defense mechanism. The last player standing with cards loses. We show that, even restricted to the perfect information two-player game, finding optimal moves is a hard problem. More precisely, we prove that, given a generalized durak position, it is PSPACE-complete to decide if a player has a winning strategy. We also show that deciding if an attack can be answered is NP-hard.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Hungarian Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["\u00c9douard Bonnet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonnet:=Eacute=douard"], "pages": 7}
