{"title": "Limits on the Power of Cryptographic Cheap Talk.", "fields": ["cryptographic protocol", "normal form game", "nash equilibrium", "cheap talk", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We revisit the question of whether cryptographic protocols can replace correlated equilibria mediators in two-player strategic games. This problem was first addressed by Dodis, Halevi and Rabin (CRYPTO 2000), who suggested replacing the mediator with a secure protocol and proved that their solution is stable in the Nash equilibrium (NE) sense, provided that the players are computationally bounded.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya"], "authors": ["Pavel Hub\u00e1cek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hub=aacute=cek:Pavel", "Jesper Buus Nielsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nielsen:Jesper_Buus", "Alon Rosen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosen:Alon"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 21}
