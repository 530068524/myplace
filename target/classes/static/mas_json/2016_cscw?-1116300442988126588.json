{"title": "Reality and Perception of Copyright Terms of Service for Online Content Creation.", "fields": ["user expectations", "social computing", "terms of service", "content creation", "user generated content"], "abstract": "From amateur creativity to social media status updates, nearly every Internet user is also a content creator\u00e2  but who owns that content? Policy, including intellectual property rights, is a necessary but often invisible part of online content sharing and social computing environments. We analyzed the copyright licenses contained in the Terms of Service of 30 different websites where users contribute content, then conducted a survey to match perceptions of copyright terms to the reality. We found that licensing terms vary in unpredictable ways, and that user expectations and opinions differ by license and by type of website. Moreover, the most undesirable terms, such as right to modify, appear more frequently than users expect. We argue that users care about how their content can be used yet lack critical information. Site designers should take user needs and community norms into account in creating and explaining copyright policies.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Michigan", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Casey Fiesler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fiesler:Casey", "Cliff Lampe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampe:Cliff", "Amy S.
