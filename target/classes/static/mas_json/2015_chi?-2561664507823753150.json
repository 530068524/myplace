{"title": "Beyond Participatory Production: Digitally Supporting Grassroots Documentary.", "fields": ["opera", "creativity", "multimedia", "citizen journalism", "grassroots"], "abstract": "We conducted a study to explore the values and qualities of 'grassroots documentaries', framed around the production of two parallel documentary films with a London-based opera company. A team of professional filmmakers produced one film and the other was an exploratory form of grassroots documentary. We studied the different production activities through observations, interviews and a reflective workshop at the end of the study and evaluated the resulting films. Our analysis reveals critical insights that could inform the next generation of technological systems to support user-generated video content (UGVC) production, particularly in collaborative contexts such as grassroots communities.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "University of Hull", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David Philip Green.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Green:David_Philip", "Simon J.
