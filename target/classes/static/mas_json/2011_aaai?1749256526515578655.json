To solve such large MDPs, we identify and leverage linearity in state and action sets that is common in resource management. In particular, we introduce linear dynamic programs (LDPs) that generalize resource management problems and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). We show that the LDP framework makes it possible to adapt point-based methods\u2013the state of the art in solving POMDPs\u2013to solving LDPs. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of this approach in managing the water level of a river reservoir. Finally, we discuss the relationship with dual dynamic programming, a method used to optimize hydroelectric systems.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["IBM", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Marek Petrik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrik:Marek", "Shlomo Zilberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zilberstein:Shlomo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
