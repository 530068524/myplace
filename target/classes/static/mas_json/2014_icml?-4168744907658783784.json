{"title": "Online Clustering of Bandits.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "cluster analysis", "regret", "scalability", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We introduce a novel algorithmic approach to content recommendation based on adaptive clustering of exploration-exploitation \"bandit\") strategies. We provide a sharp regret analysis of this algorithm in a standard stochastic noise setting, demonstrate its scalability properties, and prove its effectiveness on a number of artificial and real-world datasets. Our experiments show a significant increase in prediction performance over state-of-the-art methods for bandit problems.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Insubria", "University of Insubria", "Amazon.com"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Claudio Gentile.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentile:Claudio", "Shuai Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shuai", "Giovanni Zappella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zappella:Giovanni"], "pages": 9}
