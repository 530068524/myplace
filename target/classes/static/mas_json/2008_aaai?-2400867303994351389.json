Over the years since the theorem was proved in 1950, quite a few alternative proofs have been put forward. In this paper, we propose yet another alternative proof of the theorem. The basic idea is to use induction to reduce the theorem to the base case with 3 alternatives and 2 agents and then use computers to verify the base case. This turns out to be an effective approach for proving other impossibility theorems such as Muller-Satterthwaite and Sen's theorems as well. Motivated by the insights of the proof, we discover a new theorem with the help of computer programs. We believe this new proof opens an exciting prospect of using computers to discover similar impossibility or even possibility results.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Fangzhen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Fangzhen", "Pingzhong Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Pingzhong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
