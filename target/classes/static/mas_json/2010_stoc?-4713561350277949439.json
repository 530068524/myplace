{"title": "A sparse Johnson: Lindenstrauss transform.", "fields": ["linear algebra", "compressed sensing", "projection", "dimensionality reduction", "nearest neighbor search"], "abstract": "Dimension reduction is a key algorithmic tool with many applications including nearest-neighbor search, compressed sensing and linear algebra in the streaming model. In this work we obtain a  sparse  version of the fundamental tool in dimension reduction -- the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform. Using hashing and local densification, we construct a sparse projection matrix with just ~O(1/e) non-zero entries per column. We also show a matching lower bound on the sparsity for a large class of projection matrices. Our bounds are somewhat surprising, given the known lower bounds of \u03a9(1/e 2 ) both on the number of rows of any projection matrix and on the sparsity of projection matrices generated by natural constructions. Using this, we achieve an ~O(1/e) update time per non-zero element for a (1 e)-approximate projection, thereby substantially outperforming the ~O(1/e 2 ) update time required by prior approaches. A variant of our method offers the same guarantees for sparse vectors, yet its ~O(d) worst case running time matches the best approach of Ailon and Liberty.", "citation": "Citations (130)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anirban Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta_0001:Anirban", "Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Ravi", "Tam\u00e1s Sarl\u00f3s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarl=oacute=s:Tam=aacute=s"], "pages": 10}
