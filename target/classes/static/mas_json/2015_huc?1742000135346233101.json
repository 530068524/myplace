This paper explores barriers to engagement with activity trackers. We extend previous research by not only characterising the barriers users experienced, such as tracking accuracy and device aesthetics, but also by reporting the workarounds they created. We discuss implications for the design of activity tracking systems by reflecting on these workarounds, the potential for activity tracker design to help overcome existing barriers, and how customisation could play a role.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "City University London"], "authors": ["Daniel Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Daniel", "Paul Marshall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marshall:Paul", "Nadia Bianchi-Berthouze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bianchi=Berthouze:Nadia", "Jon Bird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bird:Jon"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 5}
