{"title": "Deep Metric Learning via Facility Location.", "fields": ["training set", "euclidean distance", "facility location problem", "structured prediction", "embedding"], "abstract": "Learning image similarity metrics in an end-to-end fashion with deep networks has demonstrated excellent results on tasks such as clustering and retrieval. However, current methods, all focus on a very local view of the data. In this paper, we propose a new metric learning scheme, based on structured prediction, that is aware of the global structure of the embedding space, and which is designed to optimize a clustering quality metric (NMI). We show state of the art performance on standard datasets, such as CUB200-2011 [37], Cars196 [18], and Stanford online products [30] on NMI and R@K evaluation metrics.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hyun Oh Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Hyun_Oh", "Stefanie Jegelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jegelka:Stefanie", "Vivek Rathod.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rathod:Vivek", "Kevin Murphy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murphy_0002:Kevin"], "pages": 9}
