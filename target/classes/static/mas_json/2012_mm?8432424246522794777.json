However, real-time transmission of high-resolution images poses a significant challenge to contemporary mobile networks. Either long delays in transmission or largely reduced image resolution can lead to bad user experience. In this paper, we propose a novel mobile-cloud scheme  IMShare  to enable instant sharing of high-resolution images. On the mobile side, high-resolution images are described by their thumbnails and SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) descriptors. After compression, data sent by mobile phones can be reduced to an average of 2.6 kilobytes (KB) per mega pixel. On the cloud side, high-resolution images are reproduced from a large-scale image database by retrieving partial duplicate images by SIFT descriptors and stitching corresponding image patches together under the guidance of the thumbnails.  IMShare  is the first scheme to demonstrate that not only visually pleasant images can be reconstructed using this mobile-cloud method but also the reconstruction can be done in seconds using parallel computing. Our user study of a half million images in a database shows that the proposed  IMShare  significantly outperforms the current method on subjective quality.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Tianjin University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Lican Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Lican", "Huanjing Yue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yue:Huanjing", "Xiaoyan Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Xiaoyan", "Feng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Feng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
