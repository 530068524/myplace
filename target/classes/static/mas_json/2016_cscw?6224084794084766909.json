{"title": "Analyzing Organizational Routines in Online Knowledge Collaborations: A Case for Sequence Analysis in CSCW.", "fields": ["management science", "sequence analysis", "computer supported cooperative work", "peer production", "fundamental unit"], "abstract": "Research into socio-technical systems like Wikipedia has overlooked important structural patterns in the coordination of distributed work. This paper argues for a conceptual reorientation towards sequences as a fundamental unit of analysis for understanding work routines in online knowledge collaboration. We outline a research agenda for researchers in computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) to understand the relationships, patterns, antecedents, and consequences of sequential behavior using methods already developed in fields like bio-informatics. Using a data set of 37,515 revisions from 16,616 unique editors to 96 Wikipedia articles as a case study, we analyze the prevalence and significance of different sequences of editing patterns. We illustrate the mixed method potential of sequence approaches by interpreting the frequent patterns as general classes of behavioral motifs. We conclude by discussing the methodological opportunities for using sequence analysis for expanding existing approaches to analyzing and theorizing about co-production routines in online knowledge collaboration.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "University of Haifa", "Haifa Universtiry"], "authors": ["Brian C.
