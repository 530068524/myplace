In this paper, we discuss two ways in which heuristic graph traversal methods can be used to generate plausible inference chains. First, we discuss how Cyc's predicate-type hierarchy can be used to get reasonable answers to queries. Second, we explain how connection graph-based techniques can be used to identify script-like structures. Finally, we demonstrate through experiments that these methods lead to significant improvement in accuracy for both Q/A and script construction.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Cycorp Inc., Austin, TX"], "authors": ["Abhishek B.
