{"title": "The Hierarchical Beta Process for Convolutional Factor Analysis and Deep Learning.", "fields": ["data set", "deep learning", "exploit", "gibbs sampling", "beta"], "abstract": "A convolutional factor-analysis model is developed, with the number of filters (factors) inferred via the beta process (BP) and hierarchical BP, for single-task and multi-task learning, respectively. The computation of the model parameters is implemented within a Bayesian setting, employing Gibbs sampling; we explicitly exploit the convolutional nature of the expansion to accelerate computations. The model is used in a multi-level (\"deep\") analysis of general data, with specific results presented for image-processing data sets, e.g., classification.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Duke University", "Princeton University", "University of Minnesota", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Bo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bo", "Gungor Polatkan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polatkan:Gungor", "Guillermo Sapiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sapiro:Guillermo", "David B.
