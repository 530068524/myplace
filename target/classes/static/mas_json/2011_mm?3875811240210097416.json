The processing is divided into image analysis for shadow extraction, calibration, and special effects. It is made highly flexible and parameterized, so that it can fit various configurations. Two specific configurations are illustrated because of their genericity: one for infrared light silhouette-based shadow and live performance, and one for both digital shadowing categories and interactive art installations with visible light. We then present some of the applications of such a platform through various live performances made by two theater companies involved in a collaborative project with scientists. The examples confirm the wide variety of scenographic setups in which shadow can be involved as a key component.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Didascalie.net, Paris, France", "L'ange Carasuel ...
