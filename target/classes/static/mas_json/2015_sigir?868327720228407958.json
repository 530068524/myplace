{"title": "Towards Understanding the Impact of Length in Web Search Result Summaries over a Speech-only Communication Channel.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "cognition", "data mining", "channel", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Presenting search results over a speech-only communication channel involves a number of challenges for users due to cognitive limitations and the serial nature of speech. We investigated the impact of search result summary length in speech-based web search, and compared our results to a text baseline. Based on crowdsourced workers, we found that users preferred longer, more informative summaries for text presentation. For audio, user preferences depended on the style of query. For single-facet queries, shortened audio summaries were preferred, additionally users were found to judge relevance with a similar accuracy compared to text-based summaries. For multi-facet queries, user preferences were not as clear, suggesting that more sophisticated techniques are required to handle such queries.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["RMIT University", "RMIT University", "RMIT University", "RMIT University"], "authors": ["Johanne R.
