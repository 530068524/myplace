In this paper, we propose a new approach to reducing the playback lag in P2P live streaming systems. According to measurement studies, there exist a certain amount of active peers, who stay longer and contribute more bandwidth than other peers. Inspired by this, we propose a tiered overlay design, in which peers are organized into three tiers based on their degrees of activity. We develop a set of algorithms to evaluate the peers' degrees of activity. Specifically, the backbone of the overlay consists of the peers with high activity in tier-1. These active peers are responsible for diffusing the newly generated fresh chunks to peers located in all the involved Autonomous Systems (ASes). They contribute more bandwidth and thus enjoy shorter playback lag. Further more, adaptive biased neighbor selection algorithm is employed among non-backbone peers to keep traffic locality. Evaluated by extensive simulations, the proposed algorithms can reduce the average playback lag and cross-ISP traffic greatly.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Dongbo Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Dongbo", "Jin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Jin", "Xin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Xin"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
