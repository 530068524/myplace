Although Food/Nutrition sector, and related communities are dispersed in many ways: geography, traditions, living standard, ideology, taste preferences, etc., eating is one of the most universal activities. Global challenges are pointing at Mega-trends which are opening opportunities for decentralized collaboration along the whole Food/Nutrition value chain. LSBC is looking to transfer its experience with Collaboration on a micro level (use case of community building of local small food producers) to decentralized communities on a large scale. LSBC is exploring community building fostering mechanisms, based on Blockchain technology, by applying principles of AI networks, such as self-regulation, self-learning, and developing concept such as stimulating connecting activity of agents/nodes. The main goal of this research is to establish principles of effective information exchange that will enable the creation of communication tools for optimizing connectivity of decentralized communities.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": [], "conf": "icde", "authors": ["Iztok Petek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petek:Iztok", "Natasa Zajec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zajec:Natasa"], "pages": 4}
