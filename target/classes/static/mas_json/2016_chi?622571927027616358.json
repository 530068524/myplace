{"title": "Proactive Sensing for Improving Hand Pose Estimation.", "fields": ["ground truth", "pose", "computer vision", "online model", "simulation"], "abstract": "We propose a novel sensing technique called proactive sensing. Proactive sensing continually repositions a camera-based sensor as a way to improve hand pose estimation. Our core contribution is a scheme that effectively learns how to move the sensor to improve pose estimation confidence while requiring no ground truth hand poses. We demonstrate this concept using a low-cost rapid swing arm system built around the state-of-the-art commercial sensing system Leap Motion. The results from our user study show that proactive sensing helps estimate users' hand poses with higher confidence compared to both static and random sensing. We further present an online model update to improve performance for each user.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Washington", "National Tsing Hua University", "University of Washington", "Northeastern University", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dun-Yu Hsiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsiao:Dun=Yu", "Min Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Min", "Christy Ballweber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ballweber:Christy", "Seth Cooper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cooper:Seth", "Zoran Popovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popovic:Zoran"], "pages": 5}
