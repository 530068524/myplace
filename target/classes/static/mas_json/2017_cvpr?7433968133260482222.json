{"title": "FlowNet 2.0: Evolution of Optical Flow Estimation with Deep Networks.", "fields": ["image warping", "optical flow", "frame rate", "flownet", "schedule"], "abstract": "The FlowNet demonstrated that optical flow estimation can be cast as a learning problem. However, the state of the art with regard to the quality of the flow has still been defined by traditional methods. Particularly on small displacements and real-world data, FlowNet cannot compete with variational methods. In this paper, we advance the concept of end-to-end learning of optical flow and make it work really well. The large improvements in quality and speed are caused by three major contributions: first, we focus on the training data and show that the schedule of presenting data during training is very important. Second, we develop a stacked architecture that includes warping of the second image with intermediate optical flow. Third, we elaborate on small displacements by introducing a subnetwork specializing on small motions. FlowNet 2.0 is only marginally slower than the original FlowNet but decreases the estimation error by more than 50%. It performs on par with state-of-the-art methods, while running at interactive frame rates. Moreover, we present faster variants that allow optical flow computation at up to 140fps with accuracy matching the original FlowNet.", "citation": "Citations (275)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Eddy Ilg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilg:Eddy", "Nikolaus Mayer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayer:Nikolaus", "Tonmoy Saikia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saikia:Tonmoy", "Margret Keuper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keuper:Margret", "Alexey Dosovitskiy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dosovitskiy:Alexey", "Thomas Brox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brox:Thomas"], "pages": 9}
