Answers). We show how such collections may be used to effectively set up large supervised learning experiments. Furthermore we investigate a wide range of feature types, some exploiting NLP processors, and demonstrate that using them in combination leads to considerable improvements in accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (224)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Pompeu Fabra University", "Pompeu Fabra University", "Pompeu Fabra University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mihai Surdeanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Surdeanu:Mihai", "Massimiliano Ciaramita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciaramita:Massimiliano", "Hugo Zaragoza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaragoza:Hugo"], "pages": 9}
