Analysis using non-relational domains is highly scalable but delivers imprecise results, whereas, use of relational domains produces precise results but does not scale up. We have developed a tool that implements K-limited path sensitive interval domain analysis to get precise results without losing on scalability. The tool was able to successfully analyse 10 million lines of embedded code for different properties such as division by zero, array index out of bound (AIOB), overflow-underflow and so on. This paper presents details of the tool and results of our experiments for detecting AIOB property. A comparison with the existing tools in the market demonstrates that our tool is more precise and scales better.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Tata Consultancy Services", "Tata Consultancy Services", "Tata Consultancy Services"], "authors": ["Shrawan Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Shrawan", "Bharti Chimdyalwar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chimdyalwar:Bharti", "Ulka Shrotri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrotri:Ulka"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
