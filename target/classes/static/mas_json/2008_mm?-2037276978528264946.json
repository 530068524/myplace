How to organize the results into semantically and visually consistent clusters becomes a necessary task to facilitate users' navigation. To attack this, HiCluster, an effective method to organize image search results is designed in this paper, which employs both textual and visual analysis. First, we extract some query-related key phrases to enumerate specific semantics of the given query and cluster them into some semantic clusters using K-lines-based clustering algorithm. Second, the resulting images corresponding to each key phrase are clustered with Bregman Bubble Clustering (BBC) algorithm, which partially groups images in the whole set while discarding some scattered noisy ones. At last, a novel user interface (UI) is designed to provide users with the diverse and helpful information based on the hierarchical clustering structure. Experiments on web images demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the system.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Haoyang Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Haoyang", "Jing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Jing", "Hanqing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hanqing"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
