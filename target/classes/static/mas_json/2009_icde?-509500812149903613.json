These methods, however, are rather expensive as the minimum Steiner tree problem is known to be NP-hard. Further, these methods cannot benefit from DBMS capabilities. We propose a new concept called Compact Steiner Tree (CSTree), which can be used to approximate the Steiner tree problem for answering top-k keyword queries efficiently. We propose a structure-aware index, together with an effective ranking mechanism for fast, progressive and accurate retrieval of $top$-$k$ highest ranked CSTrees. The proposed techniques can be implemented using a standard RDBMS to benefit from its indexing and query processing capability. The experimental results show that our method achieves high search efficiency and result quality comparing to existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "University of Queensland", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Guoliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Guoliang", "Xiaofang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiaofang", "Jianhua Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jianhua", "Jianyong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jianyong"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
