{"title": "Towards open architecture system.", "fields": ["applications architecture", "solution architecture", "database centric architecture", "the open group architecture framework", "enterprise architecture framework"], "abstract": "The use of diverse standards while developing web and mobile technologies brings new challenges when it comes to flexibility, interoperability, customizability and extensibility of the software systems. In addition, such systems in most of the cases are closed, thus make the development and customization process for system designers, developers and end-users a challenging effort. All these developments require further research attention. This work addresses these challenges from open system architecture perspective. The proposed approach is based on practical development efforts, and theoretical research including state of the art projects and definitions related to open architectures that we surveyed. The initial results indicate that a combination of service-oriented approaches with open source components and open standard data formats pave the way towards an open, extensible architecture. The core contribution of this research will be (a) an open architecture model and (b) the developed system itself based on the model, and (c) the benefits of applying open architecture approaches throughout the development processes.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Linnaeus University"], "authors": ["Bahtijar Vogel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogel:Bahtijar"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
