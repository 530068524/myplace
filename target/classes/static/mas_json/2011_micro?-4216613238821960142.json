{"title": "Towards the ideal on-chip fabric for 1-to-many and many-to-1 communication.", "fields": ["dataflow", "network packet", "cache coherence", "multi core processor", "multicast"], "abstract": "The prevalence of multicore architectures has accentuated the need for scalable cache coherence solutions. Many of the proposed designs use a mix of 1-to-1, 1-to-many (1-to-M), and many-to-1 (M-to-1) communication to maintain data coherence and consistency. The on-chip network is the communication backbone that needs to handle  all  these flows efficiently to allow these protocols to scale. However, most research in on-chip networks has focused on optimizing only 1-to-1 traffic. There has been some recent work addressing 1-to-M traffic by proposing the forking of multicast packets within the network at routers, but these techniques incur high packet delays and power penalties. There has been little research in addressing M-to-1 traffic.   We propose two in-network techniques, Flow Across Network Over Uncongested Trees (FANOUT) and Flow AggregatioN In-Network (FANIN), which perform efficient 1-to-M forking and M-to-1 aggregation, respectively, such that packets incur only single-cycle delays at most routers along their path, thus approaching an ideal network (one that incurs only wire delay/energy). Full-system simulations on a 64-core CMP with SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmarks show that FANOUT and FANIN together reduce runtime by 14.9% and network energy by 40.2%, on average, compared to state-of-the-art networks, operating at just 1% and 9.6% above the runtime and energy of an ideal network.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices"], "authors": ["Tushar Krishna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishna:Tushar", "Li-Shiuan Peh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peh:Li=Shiuan", "Bradford M.
