{"title": "The geometry of synchronization.", "fields": ["multiplicative function", "logical conjunction", "geometry of interaction", "correctness", "linear logic"], "abstract": "We graft synchronization onto Girard's Geometry of Interaction in its most concrete form, namely token machines. This is realized by introducing proof-nets for SMLL, an extension of multiplicative linear logic with a specific construct modeling synchronization points, and of a multi-token abstract machine model for it. Interestingly, the correctness criterion ensures the absence of deadlocks along reduction and in the underlying machine, this way linking logical and operational properties.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Bologna", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Ugo Dal Lago.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lago:Ugo_Dal", "Claudia Faggian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faggian:Claudia", "Ichiro Hasuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasuo:Ichiro", "Akira Yoshimizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshimizu:Akira"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
