While much research has been done to push forward the frontiers of novel interaction techniques, we argue that technology geared toward widespread adoption requires a design approach that emphasizes straightforward configuration and control, as well as flexibility. We examined the work practices of users of a large, multi-purpose conference room, and designed DICE, a system to help them use the room's capabilities. We describe the design process, and report findings about the system's usability and about people's use of a multi-purpose conference room.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory"], "authors": ["Gene Golovchinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golovchinsky:Gene", "Pernilla Qvarfordt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qvarfordt:Pernilla", "Bill van Melle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melle:Bill_van", "Scott Carter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carter:Scott", "Tony Dunnigan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunnigan:Tony"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
