In addition to being of scientific interest, our findings contribute to the overall debate of whether or not measurements of residential powerlines reveal significant information about the activities within a home. We find that the power supplies of modern TVs produce discernible electromagnetic interference (EMI) signatures that are indicative of the video content being displayed. We measure the stability of these signatures over time and across multiple instances of the same TV model, as well as the robustness of these signatures in the presence of other noisy electronic devices connected to the same powerline.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Miro Enev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Enev:Miro", "Sidhant Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Sidhant", "Tadayoshi Kohno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohno:Tadayoshi", "Shwetak N.
