Our approach combines SVGD with a set of structured local kernel functions defined on the Markov blanket of each node, which alleviates the curse of high dimensionality and simultaneously yields a distributed algorithm for decentralized inference tasks. We justify our method with theoretical analysis and show that the use of local kernels can be viewed as a new type of localized approximation that matches the target distribution on the conditional distributions of each node over its Markov blanket. Our empirical results show that our method outperforms a variety of baselines including standard MCMC and particle message passing methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Zhejiang University", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Dilin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Dilin", "Zhe Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Zhe", "Qiang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Qiang"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
