{"title": "What Can Be Predicted from Six Seconds of Driver Glances?", "fields": ["binary classification", "hidden markov model", "naturalistic observation", "predictive power", "supervised learning"], "abstract": "We consider a large dataset of real-world, on-road driving from a 100-car naturalistic study to explore the predictive power of driver glances and, specifically, to answer the following question: what can be predicted about the state of the driver and the state of the driving environment from a 6-second sequence of macro-glances? The context-based nature of such glances allows for application of supervised learning to the problem of vision-based gaze estimation, making it robust, accurate, and reliable in messy, real-world conditions. So, it's valuable to ask whether such macro-glances can be used to infer behavioral, environmental, and demographic variables? We analyze 27 binary classification problems based on these variables. The takeaway is that glance can be used as part of a multi-sensor real-time system to predict radio-tuning, fatigue state, failure to signal, talking, and several environment variables.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Toyota", "Touchstone Eval ... etroit, MI, USA", "Touchstone Eval ... etroit, MI, USA", "Touchstone Eval ... etroit, MI, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Lex Fridman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fridman:Lex", "Heishiro Toyoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toyoda:Heishiro", "Sean Seaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seaman:Sean", "Bobbie Seppelt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seppelt:Bobbie", "Linda Angell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angell:Linda", "Joonbum Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joonbum", "Bruce Mehler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehler:Bruce", "Bryan Reimer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reimer:Bryan"], "pages": 9}
