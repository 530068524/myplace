We propose a new, universally composable (UC) security definition for the two-server case (2PASS) in the public-key setting that addresses a number of relevant limitations of the previous, non-UC definition. For example, our definition makes no prior assumptions on the distribution of passwords, preserves security when honest users mistype their passwords, and guarantees secure composition with other protocols in spite of the unavoidable non-negligible success rate of online dictionary attacks. We further present a concrete 2PASS protocol and prove that it meets our definition. Given the strong security guarantees, our protocol is surprisingly efficient: in its most efficient instantiation under the DDH assumption in the random-oracle model, it requires fewer than twenty elliptic-curve exponentiations on the user's device. We achieve our results by careful protocol design and by exclusively focusing on the two-server public-key setting.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["IBM", "Brown University", "IBM"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Jan Camenisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camenisch:Jan", "Anna Lysyanskaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lysyanskaya:Anna", "Gregory Neven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neven:Gregory"], "pages": 12}
