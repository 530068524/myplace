{"title": "Sweet KNN: An Efficient KNN on GPU through Reconciliation between Redundancy Removal and Regularity.", "fields": ["minification", "kernel", "exploit", "massively parallel", "instruction set"], "abstract": "Finding the k nearest neighbors of a query point or a set of query points (KNN) is a fundamental problem in many application domains. It is expensive to do. Prior efforts in improving its speed have followed two directions with conflicting considerations: One tries to minimize the redundant distance computations but often introduces irregularities into computations, the other tries to exploit the regularity in computations to best exert the power of GPU-like massively parallel processors, which often introduces even extra distance computations. This work gives a detailed study on how to effectively combine the strengths of both approaches. It manages to reconcile the polar opposite effects of the two directions through elastic algorithmic designs, adaptive runtime configurations, and a set of careful implementation-level optimizations. The efforts finally lead to a new KNN on GPU named Sweet KNN, the first high-performance triangular-inequality-based KNN on GPU that manages to reach a sweet point between redundancy minimization and regularity preservation for various datasets. Experiments on a set of datasets show that Sweet KNN outperforms existing GPU implementations on KNN by up to 120X (11X on average).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Guoyang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Guoyang", "Yufei Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Yufei", "Xipeng Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xipeng"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
