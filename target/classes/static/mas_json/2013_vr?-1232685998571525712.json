The character on the screen can be moved with a keyboard or a mouse. In this study, we improved the rendering speed considerably by using the GPU of a PC and achieved the real-time processing by introducing an algorithm suitable for shader.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Kanagawa Institute of Technology", "Kanagawa Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sho Kimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimura:Sho", "Kazuhisa Yanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yanaka:Kazuhisa"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
