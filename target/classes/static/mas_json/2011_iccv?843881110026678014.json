We emphasize two important properties in the recent learning literature, locality and sparsity, and (1) pursue a set of local distance metrics by maximizing a conditional likelihood of observed data; and (2) add l1-norm of eigenvalues of the distance metric to favor low rank matrices of fewer parameters. Experimental results on standard UCI machine learning datasets, face recognition datasets, and image categorization datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for both distance metric learning and dimensionality reduction.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yi Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Yi", "Quannan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Quannan", "Jiayan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Jiayan", "Zhuowen Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Zhuowen"], "pages": 8}
