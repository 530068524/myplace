{"title": "Towards a Better Approximation for Sparsest Cut?", "fields": ["small set", "rounding", "approximation algorithm", "maximum cut", "graph partition"], "abstract": "We give a new (1 + e)-approximation for SPARSEST CUT problem on graphs where small sets expand significantly more than the sparsest cut (expansion of sets of size n/r exceeds that of the sparsest cut by a factor \u221alog n log r, for some small r; this condition holds for many natural graph families). We give two different algorithms. One involves Guruswami-Sinop rounding on the level-r Lasserre relaxation. The other is combinatorial and involves a new notion called Small Set Expander Flows (inspired by the expander flows of [1]) which we show exists in the input graph. Both algorithms run in time 2 O(r) poly(n). We also show similar approximation algorithms in graphs with genus g with an analogous local expansion condition. This is the first algorithm we know of that achieves (1 + e)-approximation on such general family of graphs.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Sanjeev Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora:Sanjeev", "Rong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge_0001:Rong", "Ali Kemal Sinop.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinop:Ali_Kemal"], "pages": 10}
