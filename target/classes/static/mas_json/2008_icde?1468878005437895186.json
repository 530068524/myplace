Leading vendors provide extensions to BPEL that allow for a tight integration of data processing capabilities into the process logic. Business processes exploiting these capabilities show a remarkable potential for optimization. In this demonstration, we present PGM/F, a framework for the optimization of data processing in such business processes.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Stuttgart", "IBM", "University of Stuttgart"], "authors": ["Marko Vrhovnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vrhovnik:Marko", "Oliver Suhre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suhre:Oliver", "Stephan Ewen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ewen:Stephan", "Holger Schwarz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwarz:Holger"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
