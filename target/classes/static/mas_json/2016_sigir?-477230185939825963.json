{"title": "Interleaved Evaluation for Retrospective Summarization and Prospective Notification on Document Streams.", "fields": ["heuristic", "timeline", "information seeking", "push technology", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "We propose and validate a novel interleaved evaluation methodology for two complementary information seeking tasks on document streams: retrospective summarization and prospective notification. In the first, the user desires relevant and non-redundant documents that capture important aspects of an information need. In the second, the user wishes to receive timely, relevant, and non-redundant update notifications for a standing information need. Despite superficial similarities, interleaved evaluation methods for web ranking cannot be directly applied to these tasks; for example, existing techniques do not account for temporality or redundancy. Our proposed evaluation methodology consists of two components: a temporal interleaving strategy and a heuristic for credit assignment to handle redundancy. By simulating user interactions with interleaved results on submitted runs to the TREC 2014 tweet timeline generation (TTG) task and the TREC 2015 real-time filtering task, we demonstrate that our methodology yields system comparisons that accurately match the result of batch evaluations. Analysis further reveals weaknesses in current batch evaluation methodologies to suggest future directions for research.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Xin Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Xin", "Jimmy J.
