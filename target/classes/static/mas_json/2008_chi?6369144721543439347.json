{"title": "Using tags to assist near-synchronous communication.", "fields": ["multimedia", "software deployment", "proof of concept", "asynchronous communication", "computer science"], "abstract": "In this work, we introduce the use of tags to support the near synchronous use of instant messaging. As a proof-of-concept, we developed a plug-in in Lotus Sametime, an enterprise IM client. Our plug-in supports tasks that do not need immediate attention and tasks that have deadlines. A trial deployment and survey shows that users can see the potential usefulness of such a tagging system in their IM communication. Furthermore, users rated our design intuitive and easy to use. Longer study is needed to explore communication norms that results from its use.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "IBM", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gary Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Gary", "Jennifer C.
