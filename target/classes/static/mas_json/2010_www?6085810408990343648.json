We describe how to compute tag ratios on a line-by-line basis and then cluster the resulting histogram into content and non-content areas. Initially, we find that the tag ratio histogram is not easily clustered because of its one-dimensionality; therefore we extend the original approach in order to model the data in two dimensions. Next, we present a tailored clustering technique which operates on the two-dimensional model, and then evaluate our approach against a large set of alternative methods using standard accuracy, precision and recall metrics on a large and varied Web corpus. Finally, we show that, in most cases, CETR achieves better content extraction performance than existing methods, especially across varying web domains, languages and styles.", "citation": "Citations (139)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Kansas State University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Tim Weninger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weninger:Tim", "William H.
