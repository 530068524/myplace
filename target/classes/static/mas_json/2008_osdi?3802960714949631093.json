{"title": "Quanto: Tracking Energy in Networked Embedded Systems.", "fields": ["source lines of code", "quanto", "instruction cycle", "byte", "networking hardware"], "abstract": "We present Quanto, a network-wide time and energy profiler for embedded network devices. By combining well-defined interfaces for hardware power states, fast high-resolution energy metering, and causal tracking of programmer-defined activities, Quanto can map how energy and time are spent on nodes and across a network. Implementing Quanto on the TinyOS operating system required modifying under 350 lines of code and adding 1275 new lines. We show that being able to take fine-grained energy consumption measurements as fast as reading a counter allows developers to precisely quantify the effects of low-level system implementation decisions, such as using DMA versus direct bus operations, or the effect of external interference on the power draw of a low duty-cycle radio. Finally, Quanto is lightweight enough that it has a minimal effect on system behavior: each sample takes 100 CPU cycles and 12 bytes of RAM.", "citation": "Citations (196)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Rodrigo Fonseca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fonseca:Rodrigo", "Prabal Dutta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dutta:Prabal", "Philip Levis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levis:Philip", "Ion Stoica.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoica:Ion"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2008", "pages": 16}
