However, these language models can be difficult to use in practice because of the time required to generate features for rescoring a large hypothesis set. In this work, we propose substructure sharing, which saves duplicate work in processing hypothesis sets with redundant hypothesis structures. We apply substructure sharing to a dependency parser and part of speech tagger to obtain significant speedups, and further improve the accuracy of these tools through up-training. When using these improved tools in a language model for speech recognition, we obtain significant speed improvements with both N-best and hill climbing rescoring, and show that up-training leads to WER reduction.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ariya Rastrow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rastrow:Ariya", "Mark Dredze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dredze:Mark", "Sanjeev Khudanpur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khudanpur:Sanjeev"], "pages": 9}
