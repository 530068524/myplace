{"title": "TransPhoner: automated mnemonic keyword generation.", "fields": ["mnemonic", "transliteration", "vocabulary", "lyrics", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We present TransPhoner: a system that generates keywords for a variety of scenarios including vocabulary learning, phonetic transliteration, and creative word plays. We select effective keywords by considering phonetic, orthographic and semantic word similarity, and word concept imageability. We show that keywords provided by TransPhoner improve learner performance in an online vocabulary learning study, with the improvement being more pronounced for harder words. Participants rated TransPhoner keywords as more helpful than a random keyword baseline, and almost as helpful as manually selected keywords. Comments also indicated higher engagement in the learning task, and more desire to continue learning. We demonstrate additional applications to tasks such as pure phonetic transliteration, generation of mnemonics for complex vocabulary, and topic-based transformation of song lyrics.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Manolis Savva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savva:Manolis", "Angel X.
