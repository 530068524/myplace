{"title": "MultiGranCNN: An Architecture for General Matching of Text Chunks on Multiple Levels of Granularity.", "fields": ["deep learning", "coherence", "paraphrase", "architecture", "granularity"], "abstract": "We present MultiGranCNN, a general deep learning architecture for matching text chunks. MultiGranCNN supports multigranular comparability of representations: shorter sequences in one chunk can be directly compared to longer sequences in the other chunk. MultiGranCNN also contains a flexible and modularized match feature component that is easily adaptable to different types of chunk matching. We demonstrate stateof-the-art performance of MultiGranCNN on clause coherence and paraphrase identification tasks.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Wenpeng Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin_0001:Wenpeng", "Hinrich Sch\u00fctze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=tze:Hinrich"], "pages": 11}
