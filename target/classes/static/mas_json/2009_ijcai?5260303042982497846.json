{"title": "Temporal Planning in Domains with Linear Processes.", "fields": ["facet", "heuristic", "linear fractional programming", "planner", "discretization"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of planning in domains with continuous linear numeric change. Such change cannot always be adequately modelled by discretisation and is a key facet of many interesting problems. We show how a forward-chaining temporal planner can be extended to reason with actions with continuous linear effects. We extend a temporal planner to handle numeric values using linear programming. We show how linear continuous change can be integrated into the same linear program and we discuss how a temporal-numeric heuristic can be used to provide the search guidance necessary to underpin continuous planning. We present results to show that the approach can effectively handle duration-dependent change and numeric variables subject to continuous linear change.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Strathclyde", "University of Strathclyde", "University of Strathclyde", "University of Strathclyde"], "authors": ["Amanda Jane Coles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coles:Amanda_Jane", "Andrew Coles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coles:Andrew", "Maria Fox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fox:Maria", "Derek Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Derek"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
