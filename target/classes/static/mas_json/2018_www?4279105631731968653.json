{"title": "Are All People Married?: Determining Obligatory Attributes in Knowledge Bases.", "fields": ["data mining", "completeness", "knowledge base", "generalization", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In the absence of counter-evidences, people generalize as an effective way to predict real-world facts. In this paper we discuss methods to automatically mine valid generalizations from a Knowledge Base (KB). In particular we want to determine if all instances of a class must have an attribute in the real world, if the attribute is mandatory for the class. For example, has-Birth-Date is an obligatory attribute for the class Person, while has-Spouse is not. We introduce a new way to model incompleteness and derive a method to automatically determine obligatory attributes with a precision of up to 90%.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Jonathan Lajus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lajus:Jonathan", "Fabian M.
