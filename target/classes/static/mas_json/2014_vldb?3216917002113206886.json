Recently, it has been shown that different code optimizations for database operations favor different processors. However, it is still not clear how the combination of code optimizations (e.g., loop unrolling and vectorization) will affect the performance of database algorithms on different processors.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Technical University of Dortmund", "University of Magdeburg", "University of Magdeburg"], "authors": ["David Broneske.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broneske:David", "Sebastian Bre\u00df.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bre=szlig=:Sebastian", "Gunter Saake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saake:Gunter"], "conf": "vldb", "year": "2014", "pages": 15}
