{"title": "Build Emotion Lexicon from the Mood of Crowd via Topic-Assisted Joint Non-negative Matrix Factorization.", "fields": ["lexicon", "matrix decomposition", "non negative matrix factorization", "expression", "emotion classification"], "abstract": "In the research of building emotion lexicons, we witness the exploitation of crowd-sourced affective annotation given by readers of online news articles. Such approach ignores the relationship between topics and emotion expressions which are often closely correlated. We build an emotion lexicon by developing a novel joint non-negative matrix factorization model which not only incorporates crowd-annotated emotion labels of articles but also generates the lexicon using the topic-specific matrices obtained from the factorization process. We evaluate our lexicon via emotion classification on both benchmark and built-in-house datasets. Results demonstrate the high-quality of our lexicon.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Kaisong Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Kaisong", "Wei Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Wei", "Ling Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0006:Ling", "Shi Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Shi", "Daling Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Daling", "Chengqi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chengqi"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
