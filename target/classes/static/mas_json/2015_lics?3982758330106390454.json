{"title": "Hyper Natural Deduction.", "fields": ["deduction theorem", "curry howard correspondence", "judgment", "sequent", "sequent calculus"], "abstract": "We introduce a Hyper Natural Deduction system as an extension of Gentzen's Natural Deduction system. A Hyper Natural Deduction consists of a finite set of derivations which may use, beside typical Natural Deduction rules, additional rules providing means for communication between derivations. We show that our Hyper Natural Deduction system is sound and complete for infinite-valued propositional Godel Logic, by giving translations to and from Avron's Hyper sequent Calculus. We also provide conversions for normalisation and prove the existence of normal forms for our Hyper Natural Deduction system.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Swansea University", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Arnold Beckmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beckmann:Arnold", "Norbert Preining.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Preining:Norbert"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
