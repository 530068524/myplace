This paper focus on developing a variational inference framework to learn finite Beta-Liouville mixture models that have been proposed recently as an efficient way for proportional data clustering. In contrast to the conventional expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, commonly used for learning finite mixture models, the proposed algorithm has the advantages that it is more efficient from a computational point of view and by preventing over-and under-fitting problems. Moreover, the complexity of the mixture model (i.e. the number of components) can be determined automatically and simultaneously with the parameters estimation in a closed form as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. The merits of the proposed approach are shown using both artificial data sets and two interesting and challenging real applications namely dynamic textures clustering and facial expression recognition.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Concordia University", "Concordia University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Wentao Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Wentao", "Nizar Bouguila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouguila:Nizar"], "pages": 7}
