This leads to fewer errors and more productivity for the programmers that adopt them. Unfortunately, existing implementation techniques force a hard choice between scalability and expressiveness.   Our technique allows a smoother path to scalable, continuation-based Web programs. We present a modular program transformation that allows scalable Web applications to use third-party, higher-order libraries with higher-order arguments that cause Web interaction. Consequently, our system provides existing Web applications with more scalability through significantly less memory use than the traditional technique.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Brigham Young University"], "authors": ["Jay A.
