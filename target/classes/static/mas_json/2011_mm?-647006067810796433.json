{"title": "Interactive digital scrapbook generation for travel photos based on design principles of typography.", "fields": ["digital photo frame", "dialog box", "digital photography", "typography", "design elements and principles"], "abstract": "To facilitate the photo management and sharing tasks, many application tools have been developed to generate pleasant photo slideshows, collages, or scrapbooks by applying simple templates/layouts and visual effects. In this work, we propose a convenient digital scrapbook generating system for travel photos, named as IS-Scrapbook, which keeps the virtues while dismisses the drawbacks of conventional digital photo presentation styles. The IS-Scrapbook system has three friendly attributes compared to other photo presentation tools. First, aiming to attract the audience, we highlight objects more meaningful or familiar to the viewer, e.g. the landmark and the protagonist in the photos. Second, five basic design principles of typography, i.e. proximity, contrast, balance, color harmony and repetition, are applied to produce more vivacious layouts. Third, the system automatically generates a digital scrapbook with a default layout, and the user can further adjust photo positions and enrich each page by sketching or inserting dialog bubbles with the aid of the developed user interface. User study shows that the proposed work enhances the experiences of photo browsing and gives a brand-new way of photo sharing.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "Academia Sinica", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Jung-Yu Yeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeh:Jung=Yu", "Min-Chun Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Min=Chun", "Wen-Huang Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wen=Huang", "Ja-Ling Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ja=Ling"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
