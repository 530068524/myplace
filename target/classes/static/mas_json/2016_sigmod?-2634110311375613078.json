{"title": "A Hybrid B+-tree as Solution for In-Memory Indexing on CPU-GPU Heterogeneous Computing Platforms.", "fields": ["memory architecture", "cuda pinned memory", "queries per second", "computing with memory", "in memory database"], "abstract": "An in-memory indexing tree is a critical component of many databases. Modern many-core processors, such as GPUs, are offering tremendous amounts of computing power making them an attractive choice for accelerating indexing. However, the memory available to the accelerating co-processor is rather limited and expensive in comparison to the memory available to the CPU. This drawback is a barrier to exploit the computing power of co-processors for arbitrarily large index trees. In this paper, we propose a novel design for a B+-tree based on the heterogeneous computing platform and the hybrid memory architecture found in GPUs. We propose a hybrid CPU-GPU B+-tree, \"HB+-tree,\" which targets high search throughput use cases. Unique to our design is the joint and simultaneous use of computing and memory resources of CPU-GPU systems. Our experiments show that our HB+-tree can perform up to 240 million index queries per second, which is 2.4X higher than our CPU-optimized solution.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Amirhesam Shahvarani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shahvarani:Amirhesam", "Hans-Arno Jacobsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobsen:Hans=Arno"], "pages": 16}
