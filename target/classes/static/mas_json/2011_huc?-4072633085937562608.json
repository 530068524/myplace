A multimodal experience was created, comprising ambient sounds and narratives -- heard through headphones -- and an assortment of themed tactile objects, intended to be felt. In addition, audience members were each provided with a novel haptic device that was designed to enhance their discovery of a pitch-black space. An in the wild study of the cultural experience showed how blind and sighted audience members had different 'felt' experiences, but that neither was a lesser one. Furthermore, the haptic device was found to encourage enactive exploration and provide reassurance of the environment for both sighted and blind people, rather than acting simply as a navigation guide. We discuss the potential of using haptic feedback to create cultural experiences for both blind and sighted people; rethinking current utilitarian framing of it as assistive technology.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Open University", "Open University", "University of Bristol", "University of the West of England", "Extant, London, United Kingdom"], "authors": ["Janet van der Linden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linden:Janet_van_der", "Yvonne Rogers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogers:Yvonne", "Maria Oshodi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oshodi:Maria", "Adam Spiers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spiers:Adam", "David McGoran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGoran:David", "Rafael Cronin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cronin:Rafael", "Paul O'Dowd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Dowd:Paul"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
