{"title": "Improving Ferns Ensembles by Sparsifying and Quantising Posterior Probabilities.", "fields": ["sparse approximation", "machine learning", "discriminative model", "sparse matrix", "posterior probability"], "abstract": "Ferns ensembles offer an accurate and efficient multiclass non-linear classification, commonly at the expense of consuming a large amount of memory. We introduce a two-fold contribution that produces large reductions in their memory consumption. First, an efficient L0 regularised cost optimisation finds a sparse representation of the posterior probabilities in the ensemble by discarding elements with zero contribution to valid responses in the training samples. As a by-product this can produce a prediction accuracy gain that, if required, can be traded for further reductions in memory size and prediction time. Secondly, posterior probabilities are quantised and stored in a memory-friendly sparse data structure. We reported a minimum of 75% memory reduction for different types of classification problems using generative and discriminative ferns ensembles, without increasing prediction time or classification error. For image patch recognition our proposal produced a 90% memory reduction, and improved in several percentage points the prediction accuracy.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Institute for Transuranium Elements", "Institute for Transuranium Elements"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Antonio L.
