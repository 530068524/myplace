{"title": "End-to-end integration of a Convolutional Network, Deformable Parts Model and non-maximum suppression.", "fields": ["object composition", "object detection", "discriminative model", "feature", "end to end principle"], "abstract": "Deformable Parts Models and Convolutional Networks each have achieved notable performance in object detection. Yet these two approaches find their strengths in complementary areas: DPMs are well-versed in object composition, modeling fine-grained spatial relationships between parts; likewise, ConvNets are adept at producing powerful image features, having been discriminatively trained directly on the pixels. In this paper, we propose a new model that combines these two approaches, obtaining the advantages of each. We train this model using a new structured loss function that considers all bounding boxes within an image, rather than isolated object instances. This enables the non-maximal suppression (NMS) operation, previously treated as a separate post-processing stage, to be integrated into the model. This allows for discriminative training of our combined Convnet + DPM + NMS model in end-to-end fashion. We evaluate our system on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2011 datasets, achieving competitive results on both benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Li Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Li", "David Eigen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eigen:David", "Rob Fergus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fergus:Rob"], "pages": 9}
