{"title": "Approximation Bounds for Inference using Cooperative Cuts.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "probability distribution", "inference", "treewidth", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We analyze a family of probability distributions that are characterized by an embedded combinatorial structure. This family includes models having arbitrary treewidth and arbitrary sized factors. Unlike general models with such freedom, where the \"most probable explanation\" (MPE) problem is inapproximable, the combinatorial structure within our model, in particular the indirect use of sub-modularity, leads to several MPE algorithms that all have approximation guarantees.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "University of Washington"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Stefanie Jegelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jegelka:Stefanie", "Jeff A.
