{"title": "Latent Multi-group Membership Graph Model.", "fields": ["feature structure", "graph", "data mining", "inference", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We develop the Latent Multi-group Membership Graph (LMMG) model, a model of networks with rich node feature structure. In the LMMG model, each node belongs to multiple groups and each latent group models the occurrence of links as well as the node feature structure. The LMMG can be used to summarize the network structure, to predict links between the nodes, and to predict missing features of a node. We derive efficient inference and learning algorithms and evaluate the predictive performance of the LMMG on several social and document network datasets.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Myunghwan Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0002:Myunghwan", "Jure Leskovec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leskovec:Jure"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
