The kernel decomposes a graph into all pairs of neighborhood subgraphs of small radius at increasing distances. We show that using a fast graph invariant we obtain significant speed-ups in the Gram matrix computation. Finally, we test the novel kernel on a wide range of chemoinformatics tasks, from antiviral to anticarcinogenic to toxicological activity prediction, and observe competitive performance when compared against several recent graph kernel methods.", "citation": "Citations (157)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Fabrizio Costa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costa:Fabrizio", "Kurt De Grave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grave:Kurt_De"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
