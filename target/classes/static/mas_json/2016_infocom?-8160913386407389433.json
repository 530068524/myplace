{"title": "Secure outsourced skyline query processing via untrusted cloud service providers.", "fields": ["service provider", "skyline", "point of interest", "ask price", "outsourcing"], "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a growing number of location-based service providers (LBSPs) outsourcing their points of interest (POI) datasets to third-party cloud service providers (CSPs), which in turn answer various data queries from mobile users on their behalf. A main challenge in such systems is that the CSPs cannot be fully trusted, which may return fake query results for various bad motives, e.g., in favor of POIs willing to pay. As an important type of queries, location-based skyline queries (LBSQs) ask for the POIs that are not spatially dominated by any other POI with respect to some query position. In this paper, we propose three novel schemes that enable efficient verification of any LBSQ result returned by an untrusted CSP by embedding and exploring a novel neighboring relationship among POIs. The efficacy and efficiency of our schemes are thoroughly analyzed and evaluated.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Hawaii", "Wuhan University", "University of Hawaii", "Arizona State University", "Wuhan University"], "authors": ["Wenxin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wenxin", "Mengjun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Mengjun", "Rui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Rui", "Yanchao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanchao", "Shubo Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shubo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
