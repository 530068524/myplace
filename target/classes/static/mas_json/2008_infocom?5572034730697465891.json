Due to the problem of IM spam (SPIM), building an effective anti-spim method is an important research topic. At present, most of anti-spim solutions are based on email-spam prevention techniques, which are not directly applicable to anti-spim. In this paper, we present a new anti-spim method SpimRank, which integrates trust and reputation mechanisms with black-list technique. SpimRank also tracks user's historical action to deal with spim attacks in nearly real time, which is applicable to IM environment.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jun Bi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bi:Jun", "Jianping Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jianping", "Wenmao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wenmao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
