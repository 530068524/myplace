With essentially all  deterministic  pivoting rules it is known, however, to require an exponential number of steps to solve some linear programs. No non-polynomial lower bounds were known, prior to this work, for  randomized  pivoting rules. We provide the first  subexponential  (i.e., of the form 2 \u03a9(n \u03b1 ) , for some \u03b1>0) lower bounds for the two most natural, and most studied, randomized pivoting rules suggested to date.   The first randomized pivoting rule considered is Random-Edge, which among all improving pivoting steps (or  edges ) from the current basic feasible solution (or  vertex ) chooses one uniformly at random. The second randomized pivoting rule considered is Random-Facet, a more complicated randomized pivoting rule suggested by Kalai and by Matousek, Sharir and Welzl. Our lower bound for the Random-Facet pivoting rule essentially matches the subexponential upper bounds given by Kalai and by Matousek et al Lower bounds for Random-Edge and Random-Facet were known before only in  abstract  settings, and not for concrete linear programs.   Our lower bounds are obtained by utilizing connections between pivoting steps performed by simplex-based algorithms and  improving switches  performed by  policy iteration  algorithms for solving  Markov Decision Processes  (MDPs).", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Aarhus University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Oliver Friedmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedmann:Oliver", "Thomas Dueholm Hansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hansen:Thomas_Dueholm", "Uri Zwick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zwick:Uri"], "pages": 10}
