The CPM finds a large margin convex polytope separator which encloses one class. We develop a stochastic gradient descent based algorithm that is amenable to massive datasets, and augment it with a heuristic procedure to avoid sub-optimal local minima. Our experimental evaluations of the CPM on large-scale datasets from distinct domains (MNIST handwritten digit recognition, text topic, and web security) demonstrate that the CPM trains models faster, sometimes several orders of magnitude, than state-of-the-art similar approaches and kernel-SVM methods while achieving comparable or better classification performance. Our empirical results suggest that, unlike prior similar approaches, we do not need to control the number of sub-classifiers (sides of the polytope) to avoid overfitting.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alex Kantchelian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kantchelian:Alex", "Michael Carl Tschantz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tschantz:Michael_Carl", "Ling Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Ling", "Peter L.
