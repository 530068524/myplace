Therefore, we introduce a framework of Finite State Transducer (FST) to avoid the shortcomings. Compared with the Latent Semantic Analysis with Support Vector Regression (LSA-SVR) method (stands for the conventional measures), our FST method shows better performance especially towards the ASR transcription. In addition, we apply the synonyms similarity to expand the FST model. The final scoring performance reaches an acceptable level of 0.80 which is only 0.07 lower than the correlation (0.87) between human raters.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xingyuan Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Xingyuan", "Dengfeng Ke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ke:Dengfeng", "Bo Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Bo"], "pages": 10}
