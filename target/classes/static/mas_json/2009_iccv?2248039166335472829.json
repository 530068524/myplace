{"title": "Local distance functions: A taxonomy, new algorithms, and an evaluation.", "fields": ["overfitting", "contextual image classification", "intrinsic metric", "chebyshev distance", "geodesic", "convex metric space", "metric tensor"], "abstract": "We present a taxonomy for local distance functions where most existing algorithms can be regarded as approximations of the geodesic distance defined by a metric tensor. We categorize existing algorithms by how, where, and when they estimate the metric tensor. We also extend the taxonomy along each axis. How: We introduce hybrid algorithms that use a combination of techniques to ameliorate overfitting. Where: We present an exact polynomial-time algorithm to integrate the metric tensor along the lines between the test and training points under the assumption that the metric tensor is piecewise constant. When: We propose an interpolation algorithm where the metric tensor is sampled at a number of references points during the offline phase. The reference points are then interpolated during the online classification phase. We also present a comprehensive evaluation on tasks in face recognition, object recognition, and digit recognition.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "Microsoft", "University of California, Irvine", "Microsoft"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Deva Ramanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanan:Deva", "Simon Baker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baker:Simon"], "pages": 8}
