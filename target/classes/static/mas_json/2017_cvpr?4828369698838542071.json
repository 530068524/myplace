Most existing fine-grained image classification methods generally learn part detection models to obtain the semantic parts for better classification accuracy. Despite achieving promising results, these methods mainly have two limitations: (1) not all the parts which obtained through the part detection models are beneficial and indispensable for classification, and (2) fine-grained image classification requires more detailed visual descriptions which could not be provided by the part locations or attribute annotations. For addressing the above two limitations, this paper proposes the two-stream model combing vision and language (CVL) for learning latent semantic representations. The vision stream learns deep representations from the original visual information via deep convolutional neural network. The language stream utilizes the natural language descriptions which could point out the discriminative parts or characteristics for each image, and provides a flexible and compact way of encoding the salient visual aspects for distinguishing sub-categories. Since the two streams are complementary, combing the two streams can further achieves better classification accuracy. Comparing with 12 state-of-the-art methods on the widely used CUB-200-2011 dataset for fine-grained image classification, the experimental results demonstrate our CVL approach achieves the best performance.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xiangteng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiangteng", "Yuxin Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Yuxin"], "pages": 9}
