{"title": "NID-SLAM: Robust Monocular SLAM Using Normalised Information Distance.", "fields": ["opengl", "information distance", "monocular", "simultaneous localization and mapping", "direct methods"], "abstract": "We propose a direct monocular SLAM algorithm based on the Normalised Information Distance (NID) metric. In contrast to current state-of-the-art direct methods based on photometric error minimisation, our information-theoretic NID metric provides robustness to appearance variation due to lighting, weather and structural changes in the scene. We demonstrate successful localisation and mapping across changes in lighting with a synthetic indoor scene, and across changes in weather (direct sun, rain, snow) using real-world data collected from a vehicle-mounted camera. Our approach runs in real-time on a consumer GPU using OpenGL, and provides comparable localisation accuracy to state-of-the-art photometric methods but significantly outperforms both direct and feature-based methods in robustness to appearance changes.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Geoffrey Pascoe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pascoe:Geoffrey", "Will Maddern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maddern:Will", "Michael Tanner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanner:Michael", "Pedro Pinies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinies:Pedro", "Paul Newman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Newman_0001:Paul"], "pages": 10}
