{"title": "On the relationship between higher-order recursion schemes and higher-order fixpoint logic.", "fields": ["recursion", "correctness", "modal \u03bc calculus", "thread", "abstraction model checking"], "abstract": "We study the relationship between two kinds of higher-order extensions     of model checking: HORS model checking, where models are extended to     higher-order recursion schemes, and HFL model checking, where the     logic is extedned to higher-order modal fixpoint logic. Those extensions     have been independently studied until recently, and the former has     been applied to higher-order program verification. We show that there     exist (arguably) natural reductions between the two problems. To prove     the correctness of the translation from HORS to HFL model checking, we     establish a type-based characterization of HFL model checking, which     should be of independent interest. The results reveal a close     relationship between the two problems, enabling cross-fertilization of     the two research threads.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Kassel"], "authors": ["Naoki Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi_0001:Naoki", "\u00c9tienne Lozes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lozes:=Eacute=tienne", "Florian Bruse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruse:Florian"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
