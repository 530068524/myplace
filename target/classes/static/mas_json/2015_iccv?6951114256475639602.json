{"title": "Render for CNN: Viewpoint Estimation in Images Using CNNs Trained with Rendered 3D Model Views.", "fields": ["image based modeling and rendering", "convolutional neural network", "training set", "scalability", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Object viewpoint estimation from 2D images is an essential task in computer vision. However, two issues hinder its progress: scarcity of training data with viewpoint annotations, and a lack of powerful features. Inspired by the growing availability of 3D models, we propose a framework to address both issues by combining render-based image synthesis and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks). We believe that 3D models have the potential in generating a large number of images of high variation, which can be well exploited by deep CNN with a high learning capacity. Towards this goal, we propose a scalable and overfit-resistant image synthesis pipeline, together with a novel CNN specifically tailored for the viewpoint estimation task. Experimentally, we show that the viewpoint estimation from our pipeline can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL 3D+ benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (263)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Hao Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Hao", "Charles Ruizhongtai Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Charles_Ruizhongtai", "Yangyan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yangyan", "Leonidas J.
