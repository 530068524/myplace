{"title": "FQHT: The Logic of Stable Models for Logic Programs with Intensional Functions.", "fields": ["intensional logic", "equivalence", "completeness", "proof theory", "formal semantics"], "abstract": "We study a logical system FQHT that is appropriate for reasoning about nonmonotonic theories with intensional functions as treated in the approach of [Bartholomew and Lee, 2012]. We provide a logical semantics, a Gentzen style proof theory and establish completeness results. The adequacy of the approach is demonstrated by showing that it captures the Bartholemew/Lee semantics and satisfies a strong equivalence property.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Toulouse", "Technical University of Madrid", "University of M\u00e1laga"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Luis Fari\u00f1as del Cerro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cerro:Luis_Fari=ntilde=as_del", "David Pearce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pearce_0001:David", "Agust\u00edn Valverde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valverde:Agust=iacute=n"], "pages": 7}
