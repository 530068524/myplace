{"title": "On the Lov\u00e1sz Theta function for Independent Sets in Sparse Graphs.", "fields": ["independent set", "semidefinite programming", "degree", "graph", "theta function", "ramsey theory", "log log plot"], "abstract": "We consider the maximum independent set problem on graphs with maximum degree d. We show that the integrality gap of the Lovasz Theta function-based SDP has an integrality gap of O~(d/log 3/2  d). This improves on the previous best result of O~(d/log d), and narrows the gap of this basic SDP to the integrality gap of O~(d/log 2  d) recently shown for stronger SDPs, namely those obtained using poly log(d) levels of the SA+ semidefinite hierarchy. The improvement comes from an improved Ramsey-theoretic bound on the independence number of K r -free graphs for large values of r.   We also show how to obtain an algorithmic version of the above-mentioned SAplus-based integrality gap result, via a coloring algorithm of Johansson. The resulting approximation guarantee of O~(d/log 2  d) matches the best unique-games-based hardness result up to lower-order poly (log log d) factors.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Nikhil Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Nikhil", "Anupam Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Anupam", "Guru Guruganesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guruganesh:Guru"], "pages": 8}
