{"title": "Combining Intra- and Multi-sentential Rhetorical Parsing for Document-level Discourse Analysis.", "fields": ["rhetorical question", "discourse analysis", "natural language processing", "conditional random field", "parsing"], "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for developing a two-stage document-level discourse parser. Our parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing algorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intrasentential parsing and the other for multisentential parsing. We present two approaches to combine these two stages of discourse parsing effectively. A set of empirical evaluations over two different datasets demonstrates that our discourse parser significantly outperforms the stateof-the-art, often by a wide margin.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Qatar Computing Research Institute", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shafiq R.
