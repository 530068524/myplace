{"title": "Floating integral photography using Fresnel mirror.", "fields": ["stereo display", "computer animation", "animation", "parallax", "mirror image"], "abstract": "We previously developed an integral photography (IP) system in which a 3D image with both horizontal and vertical parallax looks as if it is floating in the air, and we have now expanded it so that animated images can be displayed. No special glasses are necessary with this system, which consists of a 3D display subsystem and a Fresnel mirror. The light emitted from the 3D display subsystem is reflected by the Fresnel mirror, and the image of a floating object is then formed in space.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Kanagawa Institute of Technology", "Kanagawa Institute of Technology", "Kanagawa Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kazuhisa Yanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yanaka:Kazuhisa", "Masahiko Yoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoda:Masahiko", "Terumichi Iizuka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iizuka:Terumichi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
