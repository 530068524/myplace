When users are aware of their mental states - particularly those which might be detrimental to their health (e.g. high stress, low excitement) - they can take the necessary steps to either alter their behavior, or find ways to effectively cope with it. From a technology viewpoint, it is thus important to find ways to detect a user's cognitive state as unobtrusively as possible, and thereafter either inform or assist the users in coping with it. Through this position paper, we wish to discuss the potential of using mobile context data gathered from a user's smartphone to infer the user's cognitive state, and thereafter using mobile notifications to deliver timely intervention messages.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Akhil Mathur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mathur:Akhil", "Fahim Kawsar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawsar:Fahim"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
