{"title": "Sparrow: distributed, low latency scheduling.", "fields": ["latency", "sparrow", "high availability", "throughput", "low latency"], "abstract": "Large-scale data analytics frameworks are shifting towards shorter task durations and larger degrees of parallelism to provide low latency. Scheduling highly parallel jobs that complete in hundreds of milliseconds poses a major challenge for task schedulers, which will need to schedule millions of tasks per second on appropriate machines while offering millisecond-level latency and high availability. We demonstrate that a decentralized, randomized sampling approach provides near-optimal performance while avoiding the throughput and availability limitations of a centralized design. We implement and deploy our scheduler, Sparrow, on a 110-machine cluster and demonstrate that Sparrow performs within 12% of an ideal scheduler.", "citation": "Citations (308)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Kay Ousterhout.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ousterhout:Kay", "Patrick Wendell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wendell:Patrick", "Matei Zaharia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaharia:Matei", "Ion Stoica.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoica:Ion"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2013", "pages": 16}
