{"title": "Resistance against Iterated Attacks by Decorrelation Revisited, .", "fields": ["transposition cipher", "plaintext", "stream cipher attack", "key whitening", "decorrelation theory"], "abstract": "Iterated attacks are comprised of iterating adversaries who can make d plaintext queries, in each iteration to compute a bit, and are trying to distinguish between a random cipher C and the ideal random cipher $$C^*$$ based on all bits. In EUROCRYPT '99, Vaudenay showed that a 2d-decorrelated cipher resists to iterated attacks of order d when iterations make almost no common queries. Then, he first asked what the necessary conditions are for a cipher to resist a non-adaptive iterated attack of order d. Secondly, he speculated that repeating a plaintext query in different iterations does not provide any advantage to a non-adaptive distinguisher. We close here these two long-standing open problems.\n\nWe show that, in order to resist non-adaptive iterated attacks of order d, decorrelation of order $$2d-1$$ is not sufficient. We do this by providing a counterexample consisting of a cipher decorrelated to the order $$2d-1$$ and a successful non-adaptive iterated attack of order d against it.\n\nMoreover, we prove that the aforementioned claim is wrong by showing that a higher probability of having a common query between different iterations can translate to a high advantage of the adversary in distinguishing C from $$C^*$$ . We provide a counterintuitive example consisting of a cipher decorrelated to the order 2d which can be broken by an iterated attack of order 1 having a high probability of common queries.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Asli Bay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bay:Asli", "Atefeh Mashatan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mashatan:Atefeh", "Serge Vaudenay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaudenay:Serge"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 17}
