We define question temporality based on when the answers provided on the questions would expire. We use classification methods to show that the question temporality can be assessed automatically. Our regression analysis highlights features that predict temporality of the questions. Our research can be instructive for interface designers to design temporality-aware interfaces and influence selection of questions and answers for display.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Aditya Pal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pal:Aditya", "James Margatan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Margatan:James", "Joseph A.
