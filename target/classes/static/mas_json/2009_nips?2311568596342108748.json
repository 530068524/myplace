We propose a novel metric learning model which can simultaneously conduct dimension reduction and learn a distance matrix. The sparse representation involves a mixed-norm regularization which is non-convex. We then show that it can be equivalently formulated as a convex saddle (min-max) problem. From this saddle representation, we develop an efficient smooth optimization approach [17] for sparse metric learning, although the learning model is based on a non-differentiable loss function. Finally, we run experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our sparse metric learning model on various datasets.", "citation": "Citations (110)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Bristol"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yiming Ying.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ying:Yiming", "Kaizhu Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Kaizhu", "Colin Campbell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Campbell:Colin"], "pages": 9}
