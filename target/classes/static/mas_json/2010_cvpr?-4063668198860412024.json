Through building a training set of high-resolution/low-resolution image segment pairs, the high-resolution pixel is hallucinated from its texturally similar segments which are retrieved from the training set by texture similarity. Given the discrete hallucinated examples, a continuous energy function is designed to enforce the fidelity of high-resolution image to low-resolution input and the constraints imposed by the hallucinated examples and the edge smoothness prior. The reconstructed high-resolution image is sharp with minimal artifacts both along the edges and in the textural regions.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0009:Jian", "Jiejie Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jiejie", "Marshall F.
