In this paper we consider the problem of designing weak learners that are especially adept to the boosting procedure and specifically the AdaBoost algorithm.\n\nFirst we describe conditions desirable for a weak learning algorithm. We then propose using sparse parity functions as weak learners, which have many of our desired properties, as weak learners in boosting. Our experimental tests show the proposed weak learners to be competitive with the most widely used ones: decision stumps and pruned decision trees.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Lev Reyzin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reyzin:Lev"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
