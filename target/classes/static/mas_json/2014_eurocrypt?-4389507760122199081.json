However, all efficient general-computation 2PC protocols require multiple rounds of interaction between the two players. This property restricts 2PC to be only relevant to scenarios where both players can be simultaneously online, and where communication latency is not an issue.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Arash Afshar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Afshar:Arash", "Payman Mohassel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohassel:Payman", "Benny Pinkas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinkas:Benny", "Ben Riva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riva:Ben"], "pages": 18}
