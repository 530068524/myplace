As a new way to interact with computing devices, gestures have been proven to be intuitive and natural, with very minimal learning curve. They can be used in applications beyond games, such as those that allow the creation of artistic and musical content in a collaborative fashion. In order for multiple users to collaborate or compete in real time, however, such gestures need to be streamed in multiple broadcast sessions with an \u201call-to-all\u201d broadcast nature, with each session corresponding to one of users as a source of a gesture stream. These streams of gestures typically incur low yet bursty bit rates, but have unique requirements with respect to delay and loss. In this paper, we present the design of GestureFlow, a gesture broadcast protocol designed specifically for concurrent gesture streams in multiple broadcast sessions. We motivate the effectiveness and practicality of using inter-session network coding, and address challenges introduced by linear dependence, discovered in our extensive experiments involving a new gesture-intensive iPad application that we developed from scratch.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Yuan Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Yuan", "Zimu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zimu", "Baochun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baochun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
