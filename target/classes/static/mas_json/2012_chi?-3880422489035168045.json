{"title": "DragLocks: handling temporal ambiguities in direct manipulation video navigation.", "fields": ["timeline", "computer vision", "multimedia", "artificial intelligence", "workaround"], "abstract": "Direct manipulation video navigation (DMVN) systems allow to navigate inside video scenes by spatially manipulating objects in the video. Problems arise when dealing with temporal ambiguities where a time span is projected onto a single point in image space, e.g., when objects stop moving. Existing DMVN systems deal with these cases by either disabling navigation on the paused object or by allowing jumps in the timeline. Both of these workarounds are undesirable as they introduce inconsistency or provoke loss of context. We analyze current practices regarding temporal ambiguities and introduce two new methods to visualize and navigate object pauses. User tests show that the new approaches are better suited for navigation in scenes containing temporal ambiguities and are rated higher in terms of user satisfaction.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Thorsten Karrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karrer:Thorsten", "Moritz Wittenhagen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wittenhagen:Moritz", "Jan O.
