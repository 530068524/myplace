{"title": "BumbleBee: a refactoring environment for spreadsheet formulas.", "fields": ["theoretical computer science", "programming language", "code refactoring", "extensibility", "syntax"], "abstract": "Spreadsheets are widely used in industry. It is estimated that end-user programmers outnumber regular programmers by a factor of 5. However, spreadsheets are error-prone: several reports exist of companies that have lost big sums of money due to spreadsheet errors. In previous work, spreadsheet smells have proven to be the cause of some of these errors. To that end, we have developed a tool that can apply refactorings to spreadsheet formulas, implementing our previous work on spreadsheet refactoring, which showed that spreadsheet formula smells are very common and that refactorings for them are widely applicable and that refactoring them with a tool is both quicker and less error-prone. Our new tool Bumblebee is able to execute refactorings originating from both these papers, by means of an extensible syntax, and can furthermore apply refactorings on entire groups of formulas, thus improving upon the existing tool RefBook. Finally, BumbleBee can also execute transformations other than refactorings.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Felienne Hermans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hermans:Felienne", "Danny Dig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dig:Danny"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
