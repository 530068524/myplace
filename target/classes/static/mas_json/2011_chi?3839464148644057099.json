In this paper, we identify the  end of life  as another period of the human lifespan that merits consideration by technology designers and researchers. This paper maps out current and future research in HCI at the end of life by first describing how this area raises questions concerning materiality and artifacts, social identities, temporality and methodologies. Having provided a description of the richness of this area, we then frame it against HCI traditions and practices in an orientation we term the  lifespan-oriented approach . This paper maps early efforts in end of life research, structures and suggests areas for continued work, and situates the end of life among existing areas of HCI research.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "University of Nottingham"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Michael Massimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massimi:Michael", "William Odom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Odom:William", "Richard Banks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banks:Richard", "David S.
