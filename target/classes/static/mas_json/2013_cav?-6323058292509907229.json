{"title": "Smten: Automatic Translation of High-Level Symbolic Computations into SMT Queries.", "fields": ["computer aided", "regular expression", "semantic reasoner", "string", "constraint satisfaction problem"], "abstract": "Development of computer aided verification tools has greatly benefited from SMT technologies; instead of writing an ad-hoc reasoning engine, designers translate their problem into SMT queries which solvers can efficiently solve. Translating a problem into effective SMT queries, however, is itself a tedious, error-prone, and non-trivial task. This paper introduces Smten, a tool for automatically translating high-level symbolic computations into SMT queries. We demonstrate the use of Smten in the development of an SMT-based string constraint solver.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "SRI International"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Richard Uhler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uhler:Richard", "Nirav Dave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dave:Nirav"], "pages": 6}
