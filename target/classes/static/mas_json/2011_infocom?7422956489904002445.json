The optimization objective is to maximize the weighted sum-rate under total and individual power constraints on the transmitters. By observing the special structure of a three-dimensional assignment problem derived from the original problem, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm based on continuity relaxation and dual minimization. The proposed method is shown to be optimal for all relaying strategies that give a concave rate function in terms of power constraints.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Ontario Institute of Technology", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Mahdi Hajiaghayi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hajiaghayi:Mahdi", "Min Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Min", "Ben Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Ben"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
