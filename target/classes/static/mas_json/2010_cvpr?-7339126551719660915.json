{"title": "Recognizing human actions from still images with latent poses.", "fields": ["learning object", "exploit", "pose", "latent variable", "computer vision"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of recognizing human actions from still images. We propose a novel approach that treats the pose of the person in the image as latent variables that will help with recognition. Different from other work that learns separate systems for pose estimation and action recognition, then combines them in an ad-hoc fashion, our system is trained in an integrated fashion that jointly considers poses and actions. Our learning objective is designed to directly exploit the pose information for action recognition. Our experimental results demonstrate that by inferring the latent poses, we can improve the final action recognition results.", "citation": "Citations (240)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Weilong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Weilong", "Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Yang", "Greg Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Greg"], "pages": 8}
