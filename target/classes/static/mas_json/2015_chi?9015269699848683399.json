When users perform spatial operations on the optical components, they deform the visual content that is printed on paper, and thereby provide dynamic visual feedback on user interactions without any display devices. The magnetic unit that is embedded in each lens and mirror allows the unit to be identified and tracked using an analog Hall-sensor grid that is placed behind the paper, so the system provides additional auditory and visual feedback through different levels of embodiment, further enhancing the interactivity with the printed content on the physical paper.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rong-Hao Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Rong=Hao", "Chao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chao", "Yu-Chien Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Yu=Chien", "Guan-Ting Chou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chou:Guan=Ting", "Li-Wei Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Li=Wei", "De-Nian Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:De=Nian", "Mike Y.
