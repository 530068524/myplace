In numerous applications, the function optimized is not known a priori, but instead learned from data. What are the guarantees we have when optimizing functions from sampled data? In this paper we show that for any monotone submodular function with curvature c there is a (1 - c)/(1 + c - c^2) approximation algorithm for maximization under cardinality constraints when polynomially-many samples are drawn from the uniform distribution over feasible sets. Moreover, we show that this algorithm is optimal. That is, for any c < 1, there exists a submodular function with curvature c for which no algorithm can achieve a better approximation. The curvature assumption is crucial as for general monotone submodular functions no algorithm can obtain a constant-factor approximation for maximization under a cardinality constraint when observing polynomially-many samples drawn from any distribution over feasible sets, even when the function is statistically learnable.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "University of California, Berkeley", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Eric Balkanski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balkanski:Eric", "Aviad Rubinstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubinstein:Aviad", "Yaron Singer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singer:Yaron"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
