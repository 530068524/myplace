{"title": "Textual Deconvolution Saliency (TDS) : a deep tool box for linguistic analysis.", "fields": ["deep learning", "deconvolution", "parsing", "salience", "rule based machine translation"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new strategy , called Text Deconvolution Saliency (TDS), to visualize linguistic information detected by a CNN for text classification. We extend Deconvolution Networks to text in order to present a new perspective on text analysis to the linguistic community. We empirically demonstrated the efficiency of our Text Decon-volution Saliency on corpora from three different languages: English, French, and Latin. For every tested dataset, our Text Deconvolution Saliency automatically encodes complex linguistic patterns based on co-occurrences and possibly on grammatical and syntax analysis.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Li\u00e8ge"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Laurent Vanni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanni:Laurent", "M\u00e9lanie Ducoffe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ducoffe:M=eacute=lanie", "Carlos Aguilar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aguilar:Carlos", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Precioso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Precioso:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Damon Mayaffre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayaffre:Damon"], "pages": 10}
