{"title": "Physical Disentanglement in a Container-Based File System.", "fields": ["torrent file", "fork", "self certifying file system", "unix file types", "file system fragmentation"], "abstract": "We introduce IceFS, a novel file system that separates physical structures of the file system. A new abstraction, the cube, is provided to enable the grouping of files and directories inside a physically isolated container. We show three major benefits of cubes within IceFS: localized reaction to faults, fast recovery, and concurrent file-system updates. We demonstrate these benefits within a VMware-based virtualized environment and within the Hadoop distributed file system. Results show that our prototype can significantly improve availability and performance, sometimes by an order of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Lanyue Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Lanyue", "Yupu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yupu", "Thanh Do.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Do:Thanh", "Samer Al-Kiswany.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Al=Kiswany:Samer", "Andrea C.
