{"title": "Medical Exam Question Answering with Large-scale Reading Comprehension.", "fields": ["reading comprehension", "question answering", "architecture", "modular design", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Reading and understanding text is one important component in computer aided diagnosis in clinical medicine, also being a major research problem in the field of NLP. In this work, we introduce a question-answering task called MedQA to study answering questions in clinical medicine using knowledge in a large-scale document collection. The aim of MedQA is to answer real-world questions with large-scale reading comprehension. We propose our solution SeaReader--a modular end-to-end reading comprehension model based on LSTM networks and dual-path attention architecture. The novel dual-path attention models information flow from two perspectives and has the ability to simultaneously read individual documents and integrate information across multiple documents. In experiments our SeaReader achieved a large increase in accuracy on MedQA over competing models. Additionally, we develop a series of novel techniques to demonstrate the interpretation of the question answering process in SeaReader.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Xiao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiao", "Ji Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ji", "Zhiyang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Zhiyang", "Xien Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xien", "Ying Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Ying"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
