{"title": "Inference by Learning: Speeding-up Graphical Model Optimization via a Coarse-to-Fine Cascade of Pruning Classifiers.", "fields": ["cascade", "machine learning", "inference", "pruning", "graphical model"], "abstract": "We propose a general and versatile framework that significantly speeds-up graphical model optimization while maintaining an excellent solution accuracy. The proposed approach, refereed as Inference by Learning or in short as IbyL, relies on a multi-scale pruning scheme that progressively reduces the solution space by use of a coarse-to-fine cascade of learnt classifiers. We thoroughly experiment with classic computer vision related MRF problems, where our novel framework constantly yields a significant time speed-up (with respect to the most efficient inference methods) and obtains a more accurate solution than directly optimizing the MRF. We make our code available on-line [4].", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole des ponts ParisTech", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Bruno Conejo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conejo:Bruno", "Nikos Komodakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komodakis:Nikos", "S\u00e9bastien Leprince.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leprince:S=eacute=bastien", "Jean-Philippe Avouac.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avouac:Jean=Philippe"], "pages": 9}
