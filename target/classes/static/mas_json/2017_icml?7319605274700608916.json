Our algorithms (AdaNet) adaptively learn both the structure of the network and its weights. They are based on a solid theoretical analysis, including data-dependent generalization guarantees that we prove and discuss in detail. We report the results of large-scale experiments with one of our algorithms on several binary classification tasks extracted from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The results demonstrate that our algorithm can automatically learn network structures with very competitive performance accuracies when compared with those achieved for neural networks found by standard approaches.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Corinna Cortes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cortes:Corinna", "Xavier Gonzalvo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonzalvo:Xavier", "Vitaly Kuznetsov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuznetsov:Vitaly", "Mehryar Mohri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohri:Mehryar", "Scott Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Scott"], "pages": 10}
