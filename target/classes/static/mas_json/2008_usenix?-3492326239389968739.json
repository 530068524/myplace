The experience revealed many unanticipated disk and storage data path behaviors as potential roadblocks for wide deployment of these optimizations, and also identified implementation issues to retrofit these concepts to legacy data paths.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University"], "authors": ["Jin Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Jin", "Christopher R.
