These systems enable distributed exploration and evidence gathering, allowing many users to pool their effort as they discuss and analyze the data. We explore how adding lightweight tag and link structure to comments can aid this analysis process. We present CommentSpace, a collaborative system in which analysts comment on visualizations and websites and then use tags and links to organize findings and identify others'\" contributions. In a pair of studies comparing CommentSpace to a system without support for tags and links, we find that a small, fixed vocabulary of tags (question, hypothesis, to-do) and links (evidence-for, evidence-against) helps analysts more consistently and accurately classify evidence and establish common ground. We also find that managing and incentivizing participation is important for analysts to progress from exploratory analysis to deeper analytical tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that tags and links can help teams complete evidence gathering and synthesis tasks and that organizing comments using tags and links improves analytic results.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Wesley Willett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willett:Wesley", "Jeffrey Heer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heer:Jeffrey", "Joseph M.
