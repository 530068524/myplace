This paper deals with skyline computation as a case study of parallelizing database operations on multicore architectures. First we parallelize three sequential skyline algorithms, BBS, SFS, and SSkyline, to see if the design principles of sequential skyline computation also extend to parallel skyline computation. Then we develop a new parallel skyline algorithm PSkyline based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. Experimental results show that all the algorithms successfully utilize multiple cores to achieve a reasonable speedup. In particular, PSkyline achieves a speedup approximately proportional to the number of cores when it needs a parallel computation the most.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Sungwoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Sungwoo", "Taekyung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Taekyung", "Jonghyun Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jonghyun", "Jinha Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jinha", "Hyeonseung Im.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Im:Hyeonseung"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
