Our starting point is the Kipnis-Shamir attack [19]. We first show new properties of the ideal generated by Kipnis-Shamir's equations. We then propose a new modeling of the problem. Concerning the practical resolution, we adopt a Grobner basis approach that permitted us to actually solve challenges A and B proposed by Courtois in [8]. Using the multi-homogeneous structure of the algebraic system, we have been able to provide a theoretical complexity bound reflecting the practical behavior of our approach. Namely, when  r i\u00be?the dimension of the matrices minus the rank of the target matrix in the MinRank problem is constant, then we have a polynomial time attack $\\mathcal{O}\\left( \\ln\\left( q\\right) \\,n^{3\\,r^{\\prime2}}\\right) $. For the challenge C [8], we obtain a theoretical bound of 266.3operations.", "citation": "Citations (112)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "ENSTA, Paris cedex 15, 75739"], "authors": ["Jean-Charles Faug\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faug=egrave=re:Jean=Charles", "Fran\u00e7oise Levy-dit-Vehel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levy=dit=Vehel:Fran=ccedil=oise", "Ludovic Perret.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perret:Ludovic"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 17}
