{"title": "Chameleon Devices: Investigating More Secure and Discreet Mobile Interactions via Active Camouflaging.", "fields": ["mobile interaction", "multimedia", "have quick", "sight", "ranging"], "abstract": "Many users value the ability to have quick and frequent sight of their mobiles when in public settings. However, in doing so, they expose themselves to potential risks, ranging from being targets of robbery to the more subtle social losses through being seen to be rude or inattentive to those around them. In nature, some animals can blend into their environments to avoid being eaten or to reduce their impact on the ecosystem around them. Taking inspiration from these evolved systems we investigate the notion of chameleon approaches for mobile interaction design. Our probes were motivated, inspired and refined through extended interactions with people drawn from contexts with differing ranges of security and privacy concerns. Through deployments on users' own devices, our prototypes show the value of the concept. The encouraging results motivate further research in materials and form factors that can provide more effective automatic plain-sight hiding.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Swansea University", "Swansea University", "Swansea University", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jennifer Pearson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pearson_0001:Jennifer", "Simon Robinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robinson:Simon", "Matt Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones_0001:Matt", "Anirudha Joshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joshi:Anirudha", "Shashank Ahire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahire:Shashank", "Deepak Ranjan Sahoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahoo:Deepak_Ranjan", "Sriram Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Sriram"], "pages": 13}
