Studies have shown cognitive benefits for a vertical peephole orientation, when compared to non-egocentric interaction styles. To see how the aspect of canvas orientation effects user performance, we conducted a study (N=16) which revealed that canvas orientation has no significant effect on either navigation performance or spatial memory. We also found a significantly lower physical demand and a higher mental demand in the horizontal orientation. For short-term activities we therefore propose a vertical orientation, while for long-term activities horizontal dynamic peephole navigation is more suitable.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "University College London", "University, Konstanz, Germany"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jens M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:Jens", "Roman R\u00e4dle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=dle:Roman", "Hans-Christian Jetter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jetter:Hans=Christian", "Harald Reiterer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reiterer:Harald"], "pages": 4}
