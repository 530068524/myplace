In this paper, a deep belief network is proposed to model the semantic relevance for question-answer pairs. Observing the textual similarity between the community-driven question-answering (cQA) dataset and the forum dataset, we present a novel learning strategy to promote the performance of our method on the social community datasets without hand-annotating work. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional approaches on both the cQA and the forum corpora.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Baoxun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Baoxun", "Xiaolong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Xiaolong", "Chengjie Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Chengjie", "Bingquan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Bingquan", "Lin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Lin"], "pages": 9}
