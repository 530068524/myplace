Typical algorithms use color and texture information for classification, but there are problems due to varying lighting conditions and diversity of colors in a single material class. In this work we study the use of long wave infrared (i.e. thermal) imagery for material classification. Thermal imagery has the benefit of relative invariance to color changes, invariance to lighting conditions, and can even work in the dark. We collect a database of 21 different material classes with both color and thermal imagery. We develop a set of features that describe water permeation and heating/cooling properties, and test several variations on these methods to obtain our final classifier. The results show that the proposed method outperforms typical color and texture features, and when combined with color information, the results are improved further.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Delaware", "University of Delaware", "University of Delaware", "University of Delaware"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Philip Saponaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saponaro:Philip", "Scott Sorensen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sorensen:Scott", "Abhishek Kolagunda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolagunda:Abhishek", "Chandra Kambhamettu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kambhamettu:Chandra"], "pages": 8}
