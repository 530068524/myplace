{"title": "Comparing Position Auctions Computationally.", "fields": ["auction theory", "revenue", "revenue equivalence", "common value auction", "equilibrium selection"], "abstract": "Modern techniques for representing games and computing their Nash equilibria are approaching the point where they can be used to analyze market games. We demonstrate this by showing how the equilibria of different position auction mechanisms can be tractably identified using these techniques. These results enable detailed and quantitative comparisons of the different auction mechanisms\u2014in terms of both efficiency and revenue\u2014 under different preference models and equilibrium selection criteria.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["David Robert Martin Thompson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thompson:David_Robert_Martin", "Kevin Leyton-Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leyton=Brown:Kevin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
