{"title": "Multilabel Structured Output Learning with Random Spanning Trees of Max-Margin Markov Networks.", "fields": ["complete graph", "inference", "score", "scalability", "spanning tree"], "abstract": "We show that the usual score function for conditional Markov networks can be written as the expectation over the scores of their spanning trees. We also show that a small random sample of these output trees can attain a significant fraction of the margin obtained by the complete graph and we provide conditions under which we can perform tractable inference. The experimental results confirm that practical learning is scalable to realistic datasets using this approach.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Laval University", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "University College London"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Mario Marchand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marchand:Mario", "Hongyu Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Hongyu", "Emilie Morvant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morvant:Emilie", "Juho Rousu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rousu:Juho", "John Shawe-Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shawe=Taylor:John"], "pages": 9}
