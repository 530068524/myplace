In contrast to previous solutions using hardware compensation or pre-calibration, we propose a computational approach for blind aberration removal from a single image, by exploring various geometric and visual priors. The global rotational symmetry allows us to transform the non-uniform degeneration into several uniform ones by the proposed radial splitting and warping technique. Locally, two types of symmetry constraints, i.e. central symmetry and reflection symmetry are defined as geometric priors in central and surrounding regions, respectively. Furthermore, by investigating the visual artifacts of aberration degenerated images captured by consumer-level cameras, the non-uniform distribution of sharpness across color channels and the image lattice is exploited as visual priors, resulting in a novel strategy to utilize the guidance from the sharpest channel and local image regions to improve the overall performance and robustness. Extensive evaluation on both real and synthetic data suggests that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Adobe Systems", "Nanjing University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tao Yue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yue_0003:Tao", "Jin-Li Suo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suo:Jin=Li", "Jue Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jue", "Xun Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xun", "Qionghai Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Qionghai"], "pages": 9}
