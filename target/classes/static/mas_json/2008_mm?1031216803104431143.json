It is meant for computer vision scientist not familiar with GPU technologies. It is designed to be compatible with Intel's OpenCV library by offering GPU-accelerated operators that can be integrated into native OpenCV applications. The GpuCV framework transparently manages hardware capabilities, data synchronization, activation of low level GLSL and CUDA programs, on-the-fly benchmarking and switching to the most efficient implementation and finally offers a set of image processing operators with GPU acceleration available.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["Telecom & Management SudParis", "Telecom & Management SudParis", "Telecom & Management SudParis", "Telecom & Management SudParis"], "authors": ["Yannick Allusse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Allusse:Yannick", "Patrick Horain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horain:Patrick", "Ankit Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Ankit", "Cindula Saipriyadarshan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saipriyadarshan:Cindula"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
