It is shown that for classes of posets characterizability is equivalent to a special kind of definability in monadic second-order logic, which turns out to be incomparable to first-order definability. Several examples are given of characterizable and non-characterizable classes. For example, it is shown that the class of revision operators obtained from posets which are not total is not characterizable.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "Ctr for Rsch on Women & Gender"], "authors": ["Gy\u00f6rgy Tur\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tur=aacute=n:Gy=ouml=rgy", "Jon Yaggie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yaggie:Jon"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
