{"title": "A Statistical Tree Annotator and Its Applications.", "fields": ["machine translation", "machine learning", "natural language", "natural language processing", "parsing"], "abstract": "In many natural language applications, there is a need to enrich syntactical parse trees. We present a statistical tree annotator augmenting nodes with additional information. The annotator is generic and can be applied to a variety of applications. We report 3 such applications in this paper: predicting function tags; predicting null elements; and predicting whether a tree constituent is projectable in machine translation. Our function tag prediction system outperforms significantly published results.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xiaoqiang Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Xiaoqiang", "Bing Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Bing"], "pages": 9}
