It often leverages a guidance signal captured in different fields as an additional cue. In this work, we present a general framework for image restoration, called deeply aggregated alternating minimization (DeepAM). We propose to train deep neural network to advance two of the steps in the conventional AM algorithm: proximal mapping and \u03b2-continuation. Both steps are learned from a large dataset in an end-to-end manner. The proposed framework enables the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to operate as a regularizer in the AM algorithm. We show that our learned regularizer via deep aggregation outperforms the recent data-driven approaches as well as the nonlocal-based methods. The flexibility and effectiveness of our framework are demonstrated in several restoration tasks, including single image denoising, RGB-NIR restoration, and depth super-resolution.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Yonsei University", "Yonsei University", "Chungnam National University", "Yonsei University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Youngjung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Youngjung", "Hyungjoo Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Hyungjoo", "Dongbo Min.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Min:Dongbo", "Kwanghoon Sohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sohn:Kwanghoon"], "pages": 9}
