To any such model can be associated a network (namely a directed graph) describing which degrees of freedom interact under the dynamics. We tackle the problem of learning such a network from observation of the system trajectory over a time interval T.\n\nWe analyze the l1-regularized least squares algorithm and, in the setting in which the underlying network is sparse, we prove performance guarantees that are uniform in the sampling rate as long as this is sufficiently high. This result substantiates the notion of a well defined 'time complexity' for the network inference problem.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Bento.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bento:Jos=eacute=", "Morteza Ibrahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ibrahimi:Morteza", "Andrea Montanari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montanari:Andrea"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
