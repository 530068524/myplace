We present a new Web-based collection for focused retrieval. The document corpus is the Category A of the ClueWeb12 collection. Forty-nine queries from the educational domain were created. The $100$ documents most highly ranked for each query by a highly effective learning-to-rank method were judged for relevance using crowdsourcing. All sentences in the relevant documents were judged for relevance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ivan Habernal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habernal:Ivan", "Maria Sukhareva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sukhareva:Maria", "Fiana Raiber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raiber:Fiana", "Anna Shtok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shtok:Anna", "Oren Kurland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurland:Oren", "Hadar Ronen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ronen:Hadar", "Judit Bar-Ilan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bar=Ilan:Judit", "Iryna Gurevych.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurevych:Iryna"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
