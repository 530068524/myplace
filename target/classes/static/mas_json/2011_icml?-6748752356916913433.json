Given a planning horizon that satisfies a condition, LSE-RMax provably guarantees a return very close to the optimal return, with a high certainty, without requiring any prior knowledge of the in-degree of the transition function as input. LSE-RMax is fully implemented with a thorough analysis of its sample complexity. We also present empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness compared to prior approaches to the problem.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Doran Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty:Doran", "Peter Stone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stone:Peter"], "pages": 8}
