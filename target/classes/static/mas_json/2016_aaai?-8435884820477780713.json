{"title": "Structured Output Prediction for Semantic Perception in Autonomous Vehicles.", "fields": ["cut", "inference", "pixel", "perception", "spurious relationship"], "abstract": "A key challenge in the realization of autonomous vehicles is the machine's ability to perceive its surrounding environment. This task is tackled through a model that partitions vehicle camera input into distinct semantic classes, by taking into account visual contextual cues. The use of structured machine learning models is investigated, which not only allow for complex input, but also arbitrarily structured output. Towards this goal, an outdoor road scene dataset is constructed with accompanying fine-grained image labelings. For coherent segmentation, a structured predictor is modeled to encode label distributions conditioned on the input images. After optimizing this model through max-margin learning, based on an ontological loss function, efficient classification is realized via graph cuts inference using \u03b1-expansion. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that by taking into account contextual relations between pixel segmentation regions within a second-degree neighborhood, spurious label assignments are filtered out, leading to highly accurate semantic segmentations for outdoor scenes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University", "Ghent University"], "authors": ["Rein Houthooft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Houthooft:Rein", "Cedric De Boom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boom:Cedric_De", "Stijn Verstichel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verstichel:Stijn", "Femke Ongenae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ongenae:Femke", "Filip De Turck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turck:Filip_De"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
