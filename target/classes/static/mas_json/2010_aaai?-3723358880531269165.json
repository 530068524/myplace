{"title": "On Multi-Robot Area Coverage.", "fields": ["open system", "actuator", "real time computing", "teamwork", "robot"], "abstract": "Area coverage is one of the emerging problems in multi-robot coordination. In this task a team of robots is cooperatively trying to observe or sweep an entire area, possibly containing obstacles, with their sensors or actuators. The goal is to build an efficient path for each robot which jointly ensure that every single point in the environment can be seen or swept by at least one of the robots while performing the task.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Pooyan Fazli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fazli:Pooyan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
