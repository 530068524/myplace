Here we report a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach in which functional device elements and element arrays have been assembled from solution through the use of electronically well-defined semiconductor nanowire building blocks. We show that crossed nanowire p-n junctions and junction arrays can be assembled in over 95% yield with controllable electrical characteristics, and in addition, that these junctions can be used to create integrated nanoscale field-effect transistor arrays with nanowires as both the conducting channel and gate electrode. Nanowire junction arrays have been configured as key OR, AND, and NOR logic-gate structures with substantial gain and have been used to implement basic computation.", "citation": "Citations (1,416)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Innsbruck", "University of Innsbruck", "University of Innsbruck", "University of Innsbruck", "University of Innsbruck", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Cornell University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Philips", "Philips", "Philips", "Philips"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tom Minka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minka:Tom", "John M.
