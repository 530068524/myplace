One obstacle to exploring single-machine approaches on large datasets is that they are usually limited to running on a single machine! We build on a framework borrowed from parallel convex optimization \u2014 the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) \u2014 to develop a new consensus based algorithm for distributed training of single-machine approaches. This is demonstrated with an implementation of our novel sequential dual algorithm (DCMSVM) which allows distributed parallel training with small communication requirements. Benchmark results show significant reduction in wall clock time compared to current state of the art multiclass SVM implementation (Liblinear) on a single node. Experiments are performed on large scale image classification including results with modern high-dimensional features.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xufeng Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Xufeng", "Alexander C.
