{"title": "Gradient Weights help Nonparametric Regressors.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "weighting", "estimator", "econometrics", "kernel"], "abstract": "In regression problems over \u211dd, the unknown function f often varies more in some coordinates than in others. We show that weighting each coordinate i with the estimated norm of the ith derivative of f is an efficient way to significantly improve the performance of distance-based regressors, e.g. kernel and k-NN regressors. We propose a simple estimator of these derivative norms and prove its consistency. Moreover, the proposed estimator is efficiently learned online.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Samory Kpotufe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kpotufe:Samory", "Abdeslam Boularias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boularias:Abdeslam"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
