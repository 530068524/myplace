It exploits factored representations to achieve compactness and efficiency and to discover connectivity properties of the domain. We provide a bound on the quality of the solutions and give asymptotic analysis of the runtimes; in addition we demonstrate performance on a collection of very large domains. Results show that the quality of resulting policies is very good and the total running times, for both creating and solving the hierarchy, are significantly less than for an optimal factored MDP solver.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jennifer L.
