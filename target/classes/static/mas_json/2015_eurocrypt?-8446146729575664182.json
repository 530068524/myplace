{"title": "A Generic Approach to Invariant Subspace Attacks: Cryptanalysis of Robin, iSCREAM and Zorro.", "fields": ["invariant subspace", "linear subspace", "combinatorics", "cryptanalysis", "cipher", "weak key", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics"], "abstract": "Invariant subspace attacks were introduced at CRYPTO 2011 to cryptanalyze PRINTcipher. The invariant subspaces for PRINTcipher were discovered in an ad hoc fashion, leaving a generic technique to discover invariant subspaces in other ciphers as an open problem. Here, based on a rather simple observation, we introduce a generic algorithm to detect invariant subspaces. We apply this algorithm to the CAESAR candidate iSCREAM, the closely related LS-design Robin, as well as the lightweight cipher Zorro. For all three candidates invariant subspaces were detected, and result in practical breaks of the ciphers. A closer analysis of independent interest reveals that these invariant subspaces are underpinned by a new type of self-similarity property. For all ciphers, our strongest attack shows the existence of a weak key set of density \\(2^{-32}\\). These weak keys lead to a simple property on the plaintexts going through the whole encryption process with probability one. All our attacks have been practically verified on reference implementations of the ciphers.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Ruhr University Bochum", "Agence National ... s d\u2019Information", "Nasjonal sikkerhetsmyndighet"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Gregor Leander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leander:Gregor", "Brice Minaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minaud:Brice", "Sondre R\u00f8njom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=oslash=njom:Sondre"], "pages": 30}
