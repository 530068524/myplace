{"title": "Adaptive bug isolation.", "fields": ["instrumentation", "debugging", "heuristics", "system monitoring", "heuristic"], "abstract": "Statistical debugging uses lightweight instrumentation and statistical models to identify program behaviors that are strongly predictive of failure. However, most software is mostly correct; nearly all monitored behaviors are poor predictors of failure. We propose an adaptive monitoring strategy that mitigates the overhead associated with monitoring poor failure predictors. We begin by monitoring a small portion of the program, then automatically refine instrumentation over time to zero in on bugs. We formulate this approach as a search on the control-dependence graph of the program. We present and evaluate various heuristics that can be used for this search. We also discuss the construction of a binary instrumentor for incorporating the feedback loop into post-deployment monitoring. Performance measurements show that adaptive bug isolation yields an average performance overhead of 1% for a class of large applications, as opposed to 87% for realistic sampling-based instrumentation and 300% for complete binary instrumentation.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Piramanayagam Arumuga Nainar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nainar:Piramanayagam_Arumuga", "Ben Liblit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liblit:Ben"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
