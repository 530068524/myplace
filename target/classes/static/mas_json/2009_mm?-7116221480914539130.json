Following this trend, this paper focuses on the performance of these applications by studying the benefit of using a novel reliability concept which aims at significantly improving the performance of these time constrained applications over lossy best-effort networks.   This reliability mechanism emerged from several recent works from both network and coding theories. Its principle is to integrate feedbacks in an on-the fly coding scheme in order to optimize the trade-off \"packet decoding delay\" vs \"throughput\". We present the first evaluations of this mechanism for VoIP and video-conferencing applications for various erasure channels. Compared to classic block-based erasure codes, the results show significant gains in terms of quality observed by the user for both applications.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs de constructions a\u00e9ronautiques", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "ISAE, Toulouse, France"], "authors": ["Pierre-Ugo Tournoux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tournoux:Pierre=Ugo", "Amine Bouabdallah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouabdallah:Amine", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lacan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lacan:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Emmanuel Lochin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lochin:Emmanuel"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
