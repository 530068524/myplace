{"title": "Communication lower bounds for statistical estimation problems via a distributed data processing inequality.", "fields": ["data point", "logarithm", "minimax", "communication complexity", "message passing"], "abstract": "We study the tradeoff between the statistical error and communication cost of distributed statistical estimation problems in high dimensions. In the distributed sparse Gaussian mean estimation problem, each of the m machines receives n data points from a d-dimensional Gaussian distribution with unknown mean \u03b8 which is promised to be k-sparse. The machines communicate by message passing and aim to estimate the mean \u03b8. We provide a tight (up to logarithmic factors) tradeoff between the estimation error and the number of bits communicated between the machines. This directly leads to a lower bound for the distributed sparse linear regression problem: to achieve the statistical minimax error, the total communication is at least \u03a9(min{n,d}m), where n is the number of observations that each machine receives and d is the ambient dimension. These lower results improve upon Shamir (NIPS'14) and Steinhardt-Duchi (COLT'15) by allowing multi-round iterative communication model. We also give the first optimal simultaneous protocol in the dense case for mean estimation. As our main technique, we prove a distributed data processing inequality, as a generalization of usual data processing inequalities, which might be of independent interest and useful for other problems.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "IBM"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Mark Braverman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braverman:Mark", "Ankit Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Ankit", "Tengyu Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Tengyu", "Huy L.
