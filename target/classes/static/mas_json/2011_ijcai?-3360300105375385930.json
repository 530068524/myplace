PAM is in fact a generalization of the Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithms to handle data distributions that can be represented by a covariance matrix. The update equations for PAM are derived and theoretical error loss bounds computed. We benchmarked PAM against the original PA-I, PA-II, and ConfidenceWeighted (CW) learning. Although PAM somewhat resembles CWin its update equations, PA minimizes differences in the weights while CWminimizes differences in weight distributions. Results on 8 classification datasets, which include a real-lifemicro-blog sentiment classification task, show that PAM consistently outperformed its competitors, most notably CW. This shows that a simple approach like PAM is more practical in real-life classification tasks, compared to more sophisticated approaches like CW.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Tam T.
