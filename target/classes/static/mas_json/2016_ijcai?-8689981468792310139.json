{"title": "Multi-Modal Bayesian Embeddings for Learning Social Knowledge Graphs.", "fields": ["bayesian probability", "graph", "knowledge base", "embedding", "word error rate"], "abstract": "We study the extent to which online social networks can be connected to knowledge bases. The problem is referred to as learning social knowledge graphs. We propose a multi-modal Bayesian embedding model, GenVector, to learn latent topics that generate word embeddings and network embeddings simultaneously. GenVector leverages large-scale unlabeled data with embeddings and represents data of two modalities--i.e., social network users and knowledge concepts--in a shared latent topic space. Experiments on three datasets show that the proposed method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We then deploy the method on AMiner, an online academic search system to connect with a network of 38,049,189 researchers with a knowledge base with 35,415,011 concepts. Our method significantly decreases the error rate of learning social knowledge graphs in an online A/B test with live users.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Tsinghua University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhilin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhilin", "Jie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Jie", "William W.
