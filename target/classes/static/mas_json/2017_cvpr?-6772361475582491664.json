Reliable estimation of 3D body shape is necessary for many applications including virtual try-on, health monitoring, and avatar creation for virtual reality. Scanning bodies in minimal clothing, however, presents a practical barrier to these applications. We address this problem by estimating body shape under clothing from a sequence of 3D scans. Previous methods that have exploited body models produce smooth shapes lacking personalized details. We contribute a new approach to recover a personalized shape of the person. The estimated shape deviates from a parametric model to fit the 3D scans. We demonstrate the method using high quality 4D data as well as sequences of visual hulls extracted from multi-view images. We also make available BUFF, a new 4D dataset that enables quantitative evaluation (http://buff.is.tue.mpg.de). Our method outperforms the state of the art in both pose estimation and shape estimation, qualitatively and quantitatively.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chao", "Sergi Pujades.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pujades:Sergi", "Michael J.
