In this step, the pair of secondary users meet on the same channel, over which they negotiate on the communication parameters, to establish the communication link. This paper presents ETCH, Efficient Channel Hopping based MAC-layer protocols for communication rendezvous in DSA networks. We propose two protocols, SYNC-ETCH and ASYNC-ETCH. Both protocols achieve better time-to-rendezvous and throughput compared to previous work.", "citation": "Citations (137)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Yifan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Yifan", "Qun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qun", "Gexin Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Gexin", "Baosheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Baosheng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
