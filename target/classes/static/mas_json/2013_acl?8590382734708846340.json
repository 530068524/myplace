We focus on the phrase salad phenomenon that is observed in existing SMT results and propose a set of computationally inexpensive features to effectively detect such machine-translated sentences from a large-scale Web-mined text. Unlike previous approaches that require bilingual data, our method uses only monolingual text as input; therefore it is applicable for refining data produced by a variety of Web-mining activities. Evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 95.8% for sentences and 80.6% for text in noisy Web pages.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yuki Arase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arase:Yuki", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Ming"], "pages": 11}
