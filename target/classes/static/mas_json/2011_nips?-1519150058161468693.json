Given biologically realistic stochastic neuronal dynamics we derive a tractable learning rule for the synaptic weights towards hidden and visible neurons that leads to optimal recall of the training sequences. We show that learning synaptic weights towards hidden neurons significantly improves the storing capacity of the network. Furthermore, we derive an approximate online learning rule and show that our learning rule is consistent with Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity in that if a presynaptic spike shortly precedes a postynaptic spike, potentiation is induced and otherwise depression is elicited.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Bern", "University of Bern", "University of Bern"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Johanni Brea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brea:Johanni", "Walter Senn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Senn:Walter", "Jean-Pascal Pfister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfister:Jean=Pascal"], "pages": 9}
