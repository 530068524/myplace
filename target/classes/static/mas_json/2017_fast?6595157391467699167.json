{"title": "On the Accuracy and Scalability of Intensive I/O Workload Replay.", "fields": ["heuristic", "workload", "dependency graph", "scalability", "input output"], "abstract": "We introduce a replay tool that can be used to replay captured I/O workloads for performance evaluation of high-performance storage systems. We study several sources in the stock operating system that introduce the uncertainty of replaying a workload. Based on the remedies of these findings, we design and develop a new replay tool called hfplayer that can more accurately replay intensive block I/O workloads in a similar unscaled environment. However, to replay a given workload trace in a scaled environment, the dependency between I/O requests becomes crucial. Therefore, we propose a heuristic way of speculating I/O dependencies in a block I/O trace. Using the generated dependency graph, hfplayer is capable of replaying the I/O workload in a scaled environment. We evaluate hfplayer with a wide range of workloads using several accuracy metrics and find that it produces better accuracy when compared with two exiting available replay tools.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "NetApp", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Alireza Haghdoost.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haghdoost:Alireza", "Weiping He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Weiping", "Jerry Fredin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fredin:Jerry", "David H.
