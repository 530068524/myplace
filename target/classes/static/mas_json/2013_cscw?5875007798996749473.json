We collected indoor co-location data and instant messenger data from 22 participants for one month. Based on the data, we designed and explored several indicators which are considered to be useful for mining social relationship types. We applied machine learning techniques using the indicators and found that it is possible to develop an intelligent method to infer social relationship types.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Jinhyuk Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jinhyuk", "Seongkook Heo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heo:Seongkook", "Jaehyun Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jaehyun", "Geehyuk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Geehyuk", "Junehwa Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Junehwa"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 8}
