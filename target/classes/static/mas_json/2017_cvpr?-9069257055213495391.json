Our algorithm employs a CNN for target representation, which has a common convolutional layers but has multiple branches of fully connected layers. For better regularization, a subset of branches in the CNN are selected randomly for online learning whenever target appearance models need to be updated. Each branch may have a different number of layers to maintain variable abstraction levels of target appearances. BranchOut with multi-level target representation allows us to learn robust target appearance models with diversity and handle various challenges in visual tracking problem effectively. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in standard tracking benchmarks and shows the state-of-the-art performance even without additional pretraining on external tracking sequences.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "University of Pennsylvania", "Google"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Bohyung Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Bohyung", "Jack Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Jack", "Hartwig Adam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adam:Hartwig"], "pages": 10}
