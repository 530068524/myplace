{"title": "Generalized simultaneous registration and segmentation.", "fields": ["object detection", "energy functional", "image registration", "segmentation", "video tracking"], "abstract": "Simultaneous registration and segmentation (SRS) provides a powerful framework for tracking an object of interest in an image sequence. The state-of-the-art SRS-based tracking methods assume that the illumination is maintained constant across consecutive frames. However, this assumption does not hold in many natural image sequences due to dynamic light source and shadows. We propose a generalized model for SRS-based tracking in this paper to account for non-uniform additive illumination changes. More specifically, we introduce two new terms in the SRS energy functional which address the above mentioned problem. The first term couples the shape-based cue and intensity-based cue to establish a correspondence between them. The second term compensates for the illumination change which is complementary to the first term. We demonstrate that the proposed SRS energy functional yields superior performance over the state-of-the-art SRS-based methods for various indoor and outdoor image sequences.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Pratim Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Pratim", "Mehmet Emre Sargin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sargin:Mehmet_Emre", "B.
