{"title": "New Techniques for SPHFs and Efficient One-Round PAKE Protocols.", "fields": ["blind signature", "dictionary attack", "password", "mathematical proof", "key exchange"], "abstract": "Password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols allow two players to agree on a shared high entropy secret key, that depends on their own passwords only. Following the Gennaro and Lindell\u2019s approach, with a new kind of smooth-projective hash functions (SPHFs), Katz and Vaikuntanathan recently came up with the first concrete one-round PAKE protocols, where the two players just have to send simultaneous flows to each other. The first one is secure in the Bellare-Pointcheval-Rogaway (BPR) model and the second one in the Canetti\u2019s UC framework, but at the cost of simulation-sound non-interactive zero-knowledge (SS\u2212NIZK) proofs (one for the BPR-secure protocol and two for the UC-secure one), which make the overall constructions not really efficient.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Ruhr University Bochum", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Universit\u00e9 Panth\u00e9on\u2013Assas"], "authors": ["Fabrice Benhamouda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benhamouda:Fabrice", "Olivier Blazy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blazy:Olivier", "C\u00e9line Chevalier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chevalier:C=eacute=line", "David Pointcheval.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pointcheval:David", "Damien Vergnaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vergnaud:Damien"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 27}
