{"title": "Recent Advances and Existing Research Questions in Platform Security.", "fields": ["cryptographic protocol", "theoretical computer science", "cryptographic primitive", "cryptography", "hardware random number generator"], "abstract": "In this talk I will provide a description of recent uses Intel has made of cryptography in our platforms, including providing a hardware random number generator, using anonymous signatures, and improving performance of cryptographic algorithms. I will discuss how processor capabilities could be used more effectively by cryptographic algorithms. I will then discuss research questions in cryptographic protocols and platform security that are motivated by our goals.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Intel"], "authors": ["Ernie Brickell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brickell:Ernie"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 1}
