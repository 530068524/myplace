However, providers may well tweak ratings to their own advantage. That is why we have designed a new decentralized mechanism (dubbed MobiRate) with which portable devices store ratings in (local) tamperevident tables and check the integrity of those tables through a gossiping protocol. We evaluate the extent to which MobiRate reduces the impact of tampered ratings and consequently locates reputable service providers. We do so using real mobility and social network data. We also assess computational and communication costs of MobiRate on mobile phones.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Daniele Quercia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quercia:Daniele", "Stephen Hailes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hailes:Stephen", "Licia Capra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capra:Licia"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
