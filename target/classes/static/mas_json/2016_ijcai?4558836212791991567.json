{"title": "Practical Linear Models for Large-Scale One-Class Collaborative Filtering.", "fields": ["scale up", "benchmarking", "big data", "collaborative filtering", "limiting"], "abstract": "Collaborative filtering has emerged as the de facto approach to personalized recommendation problems. However, a scenario that has proven difficult in practice is the one-class collaborative filtering case (OC-CF), where one has examples of items that a user prefers, but no examples of items they do not prefer. In such cases, it is desirable to have recommendation algorithms that are personalized, learning-based, and highly scalable. Existing linear recommenders for OC-CF achieve good performance in benchmarking tasks, but they involve solving a large number of a regression sub-problems, limiting their applicability to large-scale problems. We show that it is possible to scale up linear recommenders to big data by learning an OCCF model in a randomized low-dimensional embedding of the user-item interaction matrix. Our algorithm, Linear-FLow, achieves state-of-the-art performance in a comprehensive set of experiments on standard benchmarks as well as real data.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Suvash Sedhain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sedhain:Suvash", "Hung Hai Bui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bui:Hung_Hai", "Jaya Kawale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawale:Jaya", "Nikos Vlassis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vlassis:Nikos", "Branislav Kveton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kveton:Branislav", "Aditya Krishna Menon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menon:Aditya_Krishna", "Trung Bui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bui:Trung", "Scott Sanner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanner:Scott"], "pages": 7}
