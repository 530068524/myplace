They have played a key role, among others, in providing verification algorithms for prominent specification formalisms such as Metric Temporal Logic. Unfortunately, when interpreted over an infinite dense time domain (such as the reals), alternating time dautomata have an undecidable language emptiness problem. The main result of this paper is that, over bounded time domains, language emptiness for alternating timed automata is decidable (but nonelementary). The proof involves showing decidability of a class of parametric McNaughton games that are played over timed words and that have winning conditions expressed in the monadic logic of order augmented with the distance-one relation. As a corollary, we establish the decidability of the time-bounded model-checking problem for Alur-Dill timed automata against specifications expressed as alternating timed automata.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Tel Aviv University", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Mark Jenkins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jenkins:Mark", "Jo\u00ebl Ouaknine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouaknine:Jo=euml=l", "Alexander Rabinovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabinovich:Alexander", "James Worrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Worrell_0001:James"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
