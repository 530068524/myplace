To maintain or manage code clones, developers often have to investigate differences of multiple cloned code fragments. However,existing program differencing techniques compare only two code fragments at a time. Developers then have to manually combine several pairwise differencing results. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically detecting differences across multiple clone instances. We have implemented our approach as an Eclipse plugin and evaluated its accuracy with three Java software systems. Our evaluation shows that our algorithm has precision over 97.66% and recall over 95.63% in three open source Java projects. We also conducted a user study of 18 developers to evaluate the usefulness of our approach for eight clone-related refactoring tasks. Our study shows that our approach can significantly improve developers\u2019performance in refactoring decisions, refactoring details, and task completion time on clone-related refactoring tasks. Automatically detecting differences across multiple clone instances also opens opportunities for building practical applications of code clones in software maintenance, such as auto-generation of application skeleton, intelligent simultaneous code editing.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Nanyang Technological University", "National University of Singapore", "Nanyang Technological University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Yun Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin_0001:Yun", "Zhenchang Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Zhenchang", "Yinxing Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Yinxing", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Yang", "Xin Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Xin", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Wenyun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wenyun"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
