{"title": "VoIPiggy: Implementation and evaluation of a mechanism to boost voice capacity in 802.11WLANs.", "fields": ["overhead", "voice over ip", "piggybacking", "commercial off the shelf", "testbed"], "abstract": "Supporting voice traffic in existing WLANs results extremely inefficient, given the large overheads of the protocol operation and the need to prioritize this traffic over, e.g., bulky transfers. In this paper we propose a simple scheme to improve the efficiency of WLANs when voice traffic is present. The mechanism is based on piggybacking voice frames over the acknowledgments, which reduces both frame overheads and time spent in contentions. We evaluate its performance in a large-scale testbed consisting on 33 commercial off-the-shelf devices. The experimental results show dramatic performance improvements in both voice-only and mixed voice-and-data scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["IMDEA Networks", "University of Brescia", "IMDEA Networks", "Carlos III Health Institute", "IMDEA Networks"], "authors": ["Pablo Salvador.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salvador:Pablo", "Francesco Gringoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gringoli:Francesco", "Vincenzo Mancuso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mancuso:Vincenzo", "Pablo Serrano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serrano_0001:Pablo", "Andrea Mannocci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannocci:Andrea", "Albert Banchs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banchs:Albert"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
