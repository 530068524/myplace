The aim is to bring together recent work on statistical modelling of source code and work on bimodal models of images and natural language. The resulting models are useful for a variety of tasks that involve natural language and source code. We demonstrate their performance on two retrieval tasks: retrieving source code snippets given a natural language query, and retrieving natural language descriptions given a source code query (i.e., source code captioning). Experiments show there to be promise in this direction, and that modelling the structure of source code improves performance.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Miltiadis Allamanis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Allamanis:Miltiadis", "Daniel Tarlow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarlow:Daniel", "Andrew D.
