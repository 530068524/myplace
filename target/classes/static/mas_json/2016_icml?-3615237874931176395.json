{"title": "Online Learning with Feedback Graphs Without the Graphs.", "fields": ["graph", "machine learning", "regret", "artificial intelligence", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "We study an online learning framework introduced by Mannor and Shamir (2011) in which the feedback is specified by a graph, in a setting where the graph may vary from round to round and is never fully revealed to the learner. We show a large gap between the adversarial and the stochastic cases. In the adversarial case, we prove that even for dense feedback graphs, the learner cannot improve upon a trivial regret bound obtained by ignoring any additional feedback besides her own loss. In contrast, in the stochastic case we give an algorithm that achieves \u0398(\u221a\u03b1T) regret over T rounds, provided that the independence numbers of the hidden feedback graphs are at most \u03b1. We also extend our results to a more general feedback model, in which the learner does not necessarily observe her own loss, and show that, even in simple cases, concealing the feedback graphs might render a learnable problem unlearnable.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Alon Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Alon", "Tamir Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Tamir", "Tomer Koren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koren:Tomer"], "pages": 9}
