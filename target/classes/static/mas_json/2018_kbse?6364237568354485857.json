{"title": "Live versioning of web applications through refactoring.", "fields": ["sandbox", "software as a service", "web usability", "software versioning", "code refactoring"], "abstract": "Client-Side Web Refactorings (CSWRs) allow improving interaction aspects of web applications by applying changes to the user interface without altering the code base, even in production settings. However, developers are not always willing, or even allowed to apply external adaptations to their applications\u2019 user interface. Besides, CSWRs do not guarantee improvements in all contexts, so it may be unwise to install them in a production version. We propose a tool that allows creating private versions of a running web application almost automatically. Using this tool, developers or usability experts can easily combine CSWRs to create alternative versions of web applications, without the need of creating a cloned sandbox environment for each version. This yields many uses, such as quickly setting up user tests, showing live alternatives to Product Owners, and even performing A/B testing. The tool is built on top of Kobold, a service that allows applying CSWRs to fix usability smells. Kobold with versioning is available at: https://autorefactoring.lifia.info.unlp.edu.ar. A screencast of the tool is available at https://youtu.be/LVc3BOtVP3I.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National University of La Plata", "National University of La Plata", "National University of La Plata", "National University of La Plata"], "authors": ["Juli\u00e1n Grigera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grigera:Juli=aacute=n", "Juan Cruz Gardey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gardey:Juan_Cruz", "Alejandra Garrido.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garrido:Alejandra", "Gustavo Rossi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossi:Gustavo"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
