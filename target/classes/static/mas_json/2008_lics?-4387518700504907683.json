{"title": "From Axioms to Analytic Rules in Nonclassical Logics.", "fields": ["process calculus", "intermediate logic", "sequent", "substructural logic", "axiom"], "abstract": "We introduce a systematic procedure to transform large classes of (Hilbert) axioms into equivalent inference rules in sequent and hypersequent calculi. This allows for the automated generation of analytic calculi for a wide range of prepositional nonclassical logics including intermediate, fuzzy and substructural logics. Our work encompasses many existing results, allows for the definition of new calculi and contains a uniform semantic proof of cut-elimination for hypersequent calculi.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "University of Denver", "National Institute of Informatics"], "authors": ["Agata Ciabattoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciabattoni:Agata", "Nikolaos Galatos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galatos:Nikolaos", "Kazushige Terui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terui:Kazushige"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
