The resulting framework is surprisingly flexible and allows us to combine a wide range of mining constraints in different ways. We implement this approach in off-the-shelf constraint programming systems and evaluate it empirically. The results show that the approach is not only very expressive, but also works well on complex benchmark problems.", "citation": "Citations (179)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Luc De Raedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raedt:Luc_De", "Tias Guns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guns:Tias", "Siegfried Nijssen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nijssen:Siegfried"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
