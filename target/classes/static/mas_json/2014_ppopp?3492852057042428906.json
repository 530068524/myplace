We achieve high performance by optimizing computation-communication overlap. Our code performs fully asynchronous communication without any support from special hardware. We also improve cache performance through loop tiling. To cope with the complex trade-off regarding our optimization techniques, we parameterize our code and auto-tune the parameters efficiently in a large parameter space. Experimental results from two systems confirm that our code achieves a speedup of up to 1.76x over the FFTW library.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Sukhyun Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Sukhyun", "Jeffrey K.
