{"title": "Unified Embedding and Metric Learning for Zero-Exemplar Event Detection.", "fields": ["ranking", "trecvid", "semantics", "embedding", "visualization"], "abstract": "Event detection in unconstrained videos is conceived as a content-based video retrieval with two modalities: textual and visual. Given a text describing a novel event, the goal is to rank related videos accordingly. This task is zero-exemplar, no video examples are given to the novel event. Related works train a bank of concept detectors on external data sources. These detectors predict confidence scores for test videos, which are ranked and retrieved accordingly. In contrast, we learn a joint space in which the visual and textual representations are embedded. The space casts a novel event as a probability of pre-defined events. Also, it learns to measure the distance between an event and its related videos. Our model is trained end-to-end on publicly available EventNet. When applied to TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection dataset, it outperforms the state-of-the-art by a considerable margin.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Qualcomm", "University of Amsterdam"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Noureldien Hussein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hussein:Noureldien", "Efstratios Gavves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavves:Efstratios", "Arnold W.
