Because the characteristics and distributions of data in different sub-domains are different, we model and analyze the video in each sub-domain separately using a transductive framework. Along with this framework, we propose a \"pseudo-Vapnik combined error bound\" to tackle the problem of imbalanced distribution of training data in certain segments of sub-domains. For effective fusion of multi-modal features, we utilize multi-resolution inference and constraints to permit evidences from different modal features to support each other. Finally, we employ a bootstrapping technique to leverage unlabeled data to boost the overall system performance. We test our framework by detecting semantic concepts in the TRECVID 2004 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is effective.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Google"], "authors": ["Gang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Gang", "Tat-Seng Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Tat=Seng", "Ming Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0003:Ming"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
