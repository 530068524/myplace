The goal of this system is to bridge the gap between the \"boxes-and-arrows\" diagrams that programmers often use to think about data-structure manipulation algorithms and the low-level imperative code that implements them. The system takes as input a set of partial input-output examples, as well as a description of the high-level structure of the desired solution. From this information, it is able to synthesize low-level imperative implementations in a matter of minutes.   The framework is based on a new approach for combining constraint-based synthesis and abstract-interpretation-based shape analysis. The approach works by encoding both the synthesis and the abstract interpretation problem as a constraint satisfaction problem whose solution defines the desired low-level implementation. We have used the framework to synthesize several data-structure manipulations involving linked lists and binary search trees, as well as an insertion operation into an And Inverter Graph.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Rishabh Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Rishabh", "Armando Solar-Lezama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solar=Lezama:Armando"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2011", "pages": 11}
