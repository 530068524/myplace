The metric is used with a model of information flow for probabilistic, interactive systems with adaptive adversaries. The model and metric are implemented in a probabilistic programming language and used to analyze several examples. The analysis demonstrates that adaptivity increases information flow.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["George Washington University", "Univ. of Maryla ... e Park, MD, USA", "Univ.
