Their creation can be enabled by tools supporting sketching or widget collections. As designers often incorporate previous ideas, we contribute the notion of blending the reappropriation of artifacts and their design tradeoffs with storyboarding. We present PIC-UP, a storyboarding tool supporting reappropriation, and report on two studies--a long-term investigation with novices and interviews with experts. We discuss how it may support design thinking, tailor to different expertise levels, facilitate reappropriation during storyboarding, and assist with communication.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Pennsylvania State University", "Michigan State University", "Virginia Tech"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Shahtab Wahid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wahid:Shahtab", "D.
