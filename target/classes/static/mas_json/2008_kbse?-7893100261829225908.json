We provide an overview of current techniques in model-based debugging and assess strengths and weaknesses of the individual approaches. An empirical comparison is presented that investigates the relative accuracy of different models on a set of test programs and fault assumptions, showing that our abstract interpretation based model provides high accuracy at significantly less computational effort than slightly more accurate techniques. We compare a range of model-based debugging techniques with other state-of-the-art automated debugging approaches and outline possible future developments in automatic debugging using model-based reasoning as the central unifying component in a comprehensive framework.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["University of South Australia", "University of South Australia"], "authors": ["Wolfgang Mayer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayer:Wolfgang", "Markus Stumptner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stumptner:Markus"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
