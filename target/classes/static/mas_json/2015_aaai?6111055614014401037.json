We propose a new supervised algorithm, which in the learning stage, automatically extracts signature consumption patterns of each device by modeling the device as a mixture of dynamical systems. In order to extract signature consumption patterns of a device corresponding to its different modes of operation, we define appropriate dissimilarities between energy snippets of the device and use them in a subset selection scheme, which we generalize to deal with time-series data. We then form a dictionary that consists of extracted power signatures across all devices. We cast the disaggregation problem as an optimization over a representation in the learned dictionary and incorporate several novel priors such as device-sparsity, knowledge about devices that do or do not work together as well as temporal consistency of the disaggregated solution. Real experiments on a publicly available energy dataset demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves promising results for energy disaggregation.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Ehsan Elhamifar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elhamifar:Ehsan", "Shankar Sastry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sastry:Shankar"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
