{"title": "Witness Encryption from Instance Independent Assumptions.", "fields": ["encryption", "attribute based encryption", "ciphertext", "witness", "multilinear map"], "abstract": "Witness encryption was proposed by Garg, Gentry, Sahai, and Waters as a means to encrypt to an instance, x, of an NP language and produce a ciphertext. In such a system, any decryptor that knows of a witness w that x is in the language can decrypt the ciphertext and learn the message. In addition to proposing the concept, their work provided a candidate for a witness encryption scheme built using multilinear encodings. However, one significant limitation of the work is that the candidate had no proof of security (other than essentially assuming the scheme secure).", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["IBM", "Columbia University", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Craig Gentry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentry:Craig", "Allison B.
