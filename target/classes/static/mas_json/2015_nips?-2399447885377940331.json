{"title": "Embed to Control: A Locally Linear Latent Dynamics Model for Control from Raw Images.", "fields": ["pixel", "machine learning", "generative model", "optimal control", "dynamical systems theory"], "abstract": "We introduce Embed to Control (E2C), a method for model learning and control of non-linear dynamical systems from raw pixel images. E2C consists of a deep generative model, belonging to the family of variational autoencoders, that learns to generate image trajectories from a latent space in which the dynamics is constrained to be locally linear. Our model is derived directly from an optimal control formulation in latent space, supports long-term prediction of image sequences and exhibits strong performance on a variety of complex control problems.", "citation": "Citations (153)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "Google"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Manuel Watter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watter:Manuel", "Jost Tobias Springenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Springenberg:Jost_Tobias", "Joschka Boedecker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boedecker:Joschka", "Martin A.
