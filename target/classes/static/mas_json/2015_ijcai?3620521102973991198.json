For such games, welfare maximizing partitions constitute desirable ways to cluster the vertices of the graph. We present both intractability results and approximation algorithms for computing welfare maximizing partitions.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["NICTA", "NICTA", "University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Haris Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz_0001:Haris", "Serge Gaspers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaspers:Serge", "Joachim Gudmundsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gudmundsson:Joachim", "Juli\u00e1n Mestre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mestre:Juli=aacute=n", "Hanjo T\u00e4ubig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/T=auml=ubig:Hanjo"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
