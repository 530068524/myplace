{"title": "Hierarchical Multitask Structured Output Learning for Large-scale Sequence Segmentation.", "fields": ["exploit", "solver", "training set", "regularization", "multi task learning"], "abstract": "We present a novel regularization-based Multitask Learning (MTL) formulation for Structured Output (SO) prediction for the case of hierarchical task relations. Structured output prediction often leads to difficult inference problems and hence requires large amounts of training data to obtain accurate models. We propose to use MTL to exploit additional information from related learning tasks by means of hierarchical regularization. Training SO models on the combined set of examples from multiple tasks can easily become infeasible for real world applications. To be able to solve the optimization problems underlying multitask structured output learning, we propose an efficient algorithm based on bundle-methods. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in applications from the domain of computational biology addressing the key problem of gene finding. We show that 1) our proposed solver achieves much faster convergence than previous methods and 2) that the Hierarchical SO-MTL approach outperforms considered non-MTL methods.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "European Molecu ... lberg, Germany"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Nico G\u00f6rnitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml=rnitz:Nico", "Christian Widmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Widmer:Christian", "Georg Zeller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeller:Georg", "Andr\u00e9 Kahles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kahles:Andr=eacute=", "S\u00f6ren Sonnenburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sonnenburg:S=ouml=ren", "Gunnar R\u00e4tsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=tsch:Gunnar"], "pages": 9}
