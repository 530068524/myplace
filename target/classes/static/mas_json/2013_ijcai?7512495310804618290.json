Our approach is based on the divide-and-combine idea. We first perform column selection on submatrices of an original data matrix in parallel, and then combine the selected columns into the final output. Our approach enjoys a theoretical relative-error upper bound. In addition, our column-based low-rank approximation partitions data in a deterministic way and makes no assumptions about matrix coherence. Compared with other traditional methods, our approach is scalable on large-scale matrices. Finally, experiments on both simulated and real world data show that our approach is both efficient and effective.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yifan Pi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pi:Yifan", "Haoruo Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Haoruo", "Shuchang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Shuchang", "Zhihua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhihua"], "pages": 7}
