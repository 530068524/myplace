The user supervision that we consider is in the form of cluster split/merge requests; such feedback is easy for users to provide because it only requires a high-level understanding of the clusters. Our algorithms start with any initial clustering and only make local changes in each step; both are desirable properties in many applications. Local changes are desirable because in practice edits of other parts of the clustering are considered churn - changes that are perceived as quality-neutral or quality-negative. We show that in this framework we can still design provably correct algorithms given that our data satisfies natural separability properties. We also show that our framework works well in practice.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Google", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Pranjal Awasthi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Awasthi:Pranjal", "Maria-Florina Balcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balcan:Maria=Florina", "Konstantin Voevodski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voevodski:Konstantin"], "pages": 9}
