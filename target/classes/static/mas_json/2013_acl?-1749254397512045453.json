ECs are ubiquitous in languages like Chinese, but they are tacitly ignored in most machine translation (MT) work because of their elusive nature. In this paper we present a comprehensive treatment of ECs by first recovering them with a structured MaxEnt model with a rich set of syntactic and lexical features, and then incorporating the predicted ECs into a Chinese-to-English machine translation task through multiple approaches, including the extraction of EC-specific sparse features. We show that the recovered empty categories not only improve the word alignment quality, but also lead to significant improvements in a large-scale state-of-the-art syntactic MT system.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["IBM"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Bing Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Bing", "Xiaoqiang Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Xiaoqiang", "Bowen Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Bowen"], "pages": 10}
