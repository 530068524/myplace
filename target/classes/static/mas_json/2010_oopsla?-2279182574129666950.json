{"title": "Scalable and systematic detection of buggy inconsistencies in source code.", "fields": ["software development", "software quality", "bebugging", "code smell", "software maintenance"], "abstract": "Software developers often duplicate source code to replicate functionality. This practice can hinder the maintenance of a software project: bugs may arise when two identical code segments are edited inconsistently. This paper presents DejaVu, a highly scalable system for detecting these general syntactic inconsistency bugs.   DejaVu operates in two phases. Given a target code base, a parallel /inconsistent clone analysis/ first enumerates all groups of source code fragments that are similar but not identical. Next, an extensible /buggy change analysis/ framework refines these results, separating each group of inconsistent fragments into a fine-grained set of inconsistent changes and classifying each as benign or buggy.   On a 75+ million line pre-production commercial code base, DejaVu executed in under five hours and produced a report of over 8,000 potential bugs. Our analysis of a sizable random sample suggests with high likelihood that at this report contains at least 2,000 true bugs and 1,000 code smells. These bugs draw from a diverse class of software defects and are often simple to correct: syntactic inconsistencies both indicate problems and suggest solutions.", "citation": "Citations (38)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "Columbia University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Mark Gabel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gabel:Mark", "Junfeng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Junfeng", "Yuan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Yuan", "Mois\u00e9s Goldszmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldszmidt:Mois=eacute=s", "Zhendong Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Zhendong"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2010", "pages": 16}
