Scalable SimRank computation has been the subject of extensive research for more than a decade, and yet, none of the existing solutions can efficiently derive SimRank scores on large graphs with provable accuracy guarantees. In particular, the state-of-the-art solution requires up to a few seconds to compute a SimRank score in million-node graphs, and does not offer any worst-case assurance in terms of the query error. This paper presents SLING, an efficient index structure for SimRank computation. SLING guarantees that each SimRank score returned has at most e additive error, and it answers any single-pair and single-source SimRank queries in O(1/e) and O(n/e) time, respectively. These time complexities are near-optimal, and are significantly better than the asymptotic bounds of the most recent approach. Furthermore, SLING requires only O(n/e) space (which is also near-optimal in an asymptotic sense) and O(m/e + n log n/\u03b4/e 2 ) pre-computation time, where \u03b4 is the failure probability of the preprocessing algorithm. We experimentally evaluate SLING with a variety of real-world graphs with up to several millions of nodes. Our results demonstrate that SLING is up to 10000 times (resp. 110 times) faster than competing methods for single-pair (resp. single-source) SimRank queries, at the cost of higher space overheads.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Boyu Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Boyu", "Xiaokui Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Xiaokui"], "pages": 16}
