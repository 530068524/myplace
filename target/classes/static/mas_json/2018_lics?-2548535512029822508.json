{"title": "On Higher Inductive Types in Cubical Type Theory.", "fields": ["presheaf", "extensionality", "homotopy type theory", "univalent foundations", "constructive"], "abstract": "Cubical type theory provides a constructive justification to certain aspects of homotopy type theory such as Voevodsky's univalence axiom. This makes many extensionality principles, like function and propositional extensionality, directly provable in the theory. This paper describes a constructive semantics, expressed in a presheaf topos with suitable structure inspired by cubical sets, of some higher inductive types. It also extends cubical type theory by a syntax for the higher inductive types of spheres, torus, suspensions, truncations, and pushouts. All of these types are justified by the semantics and have judgmental computation rules for all constructors, including the higher dimensional ones, and the universes are closed under these type formers.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Gothenburg", "University of Gothenburg", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Thierry Coquand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coquand:Thierry", "Simon Huber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huber:Simon", "Anders M\u00f6rtberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=ouml=rtberg:Anders"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
