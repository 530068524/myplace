To this end we employ and extend decidability results obtained for various temporally first-order monodic extensions of (firstorder) description logics. Using these techniques we obtain decidability and tight complexity results for various fixpoint extensions of temporal description logics.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Enrico Franconi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Franconi:Enrico", "David Toman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toman:David"], "pages": 6}
