{"title": "Click-through Prediction for Advertising in Twitter Timeline.", "fields": ["online advertising", "click through rate", "static web page", "contextual advertising", "timeline"], "abstract": "We present the problem of click-through prediction for advertising in Twitter timeline, which displays a stream of Tweets from accounts a user choose to follow. Traditional computational advertising usually appears in two forms:  sponsored search  that places ads onto the search result page when a query is issued to a search engine, and  contextual advertising  that places ads onto a regular, usually static Web page. Compared with these two paradigms, placing ads into a Tweet stream is particularly challenging given the nature of the data stream: the context into which an ad can be placed updates dynamically and never replicates. Every ad is therefore placed into a unique context. This makes the information available for training a machine learning model extremely sparse. In this study, we propose a learning-to-rank method which not only addresses the sparsity of training signals but also can be trained and updated online. The proposed method is evaluated using both offline experiments and online A/B tests, which involve very large collections of Twitter data and real Twitter users. Results of the experiments prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution, and its superiority over the current production model adopted by Twitter.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Twitter", "University of Michigan", "Twitter", "Twitter"], "authors": ["Cheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Cheng", "Yue Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yue", "Qiaozhu Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Qiaozhu", "Dong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Dong", "Sandeep Pandey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandey:Sandeep"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
