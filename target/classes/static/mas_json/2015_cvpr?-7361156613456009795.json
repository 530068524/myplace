However, standard single-way hierarchical methods are fundamentally flawed in that the errors in early steps cannot be corrected and accumulate. In this work, we propose a novel multi-branch hierarchical segmentation approach that alleviates such problems by learning multiple merging strategies in each step in a complementary manner, such that errors in one merging strategy could be corrected by the others. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance for both object proposal and object detection tasks, comparing to previous object proposal methods.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Tongji University", "Tongji University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Tongji University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chaoyang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chaoyang", "Long Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Long", "Shuang Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Shuang", "Liqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Liqing", "Jinyuan Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jinyuan", "Yichen Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Yichen"], "pages": 9}
