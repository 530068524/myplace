{"title": "Learning Statistical Scripts with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks.", "fields": ["deep learning", "natural language processing", "architecture", "recurrent neural network", "scripting language"], "abstract": "Scripts encode knowledge of prototypical sequences of events. We describe a Recurrent Neural Network model for statistical script learning using Long Short-Term Memory, an architecture which has been demonstrated to work well on a range of Artificial Intelligence tasks. We evaluate our system on two tasks, inferring held-out events from text and inferring novel events from text, substantially outperforming prior approaches on both tasks.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Karl Pichotta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pichotta:Karl", "Raymond J.
