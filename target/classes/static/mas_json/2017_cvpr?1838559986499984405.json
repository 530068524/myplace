{"title": "Making Deep Neural Networks Robust to Label Noise: A Loss Correction Approach.", "fields": ["word embedding", "mnist database", "residual", "normalization", "pooling"], "abstract": "We present a theoretically grounded approach to train deep neural networks, including recurrent networks, subject to class-dependent label noise. We propose two procedures for loss correction that are agnostic to both application domain and network architecture. They simply amount to at most a matrix inversion and multiplication, provided that we know the probability of each class being corrupted into another. We further show how one can estimate these probabilities, adapting a recent technique for noise estimation to the multi-class setting, and thus providing an end-to-end framework. Extensive experiments on MNIST, IMDB, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and a large scale dataset of clothing images employing a diversity of architectures \u2014 stacking dense, convolutional, pooling, dropout, batch normalization, word embedding, LSTM and residual layers \u2014 demonstrate the noise robustness of our proposals. Incidentally, we also prove that, when ReLU is the only non-linearity, the loss curvature is immune to class-dependent label noise.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "University of Sydney", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Giorgio Patrini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patrini:Giorgio", "Alessandro Rozza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rozza:Alessandro", "Aditya Krishna Menon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menon:Aditya_Krishna", "Richard Nock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nock:Richard", "Lizhen Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Lizhen"], "pages": 9}
