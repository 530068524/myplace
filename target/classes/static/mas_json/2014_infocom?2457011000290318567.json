{"title": "Forwarding redundancy in opportunistic mobile networks: Investigation and elimination.", "fields": ["global network", "mobile computing", "redundancy", "resource", "mobile device"], "abstract": "Opportunistic mobile networks consist of mobile devices which are intermittently connected via short-range radios. Forwarding in such networks relies on selecting relays to carry and deliver data to destinations upon opportunistic contacts. Due to the intermittent network connectivity, relays in current for- warding schemes are selected separately in a distributed manner. The contact capabilities of relays hence may overlap when they contact the same nodes and cause forwarding redundancy .T his redundancy reduces the efficiency of resource utilization in the network, and may impair the forwarding performance if being ignored. In this paper, based on experimental investigations on the characteristics of forwarding redundancy in realistic mobile networks, we propose methods to eliminate unnecessary for- warding redundancy and ensure efficient utilization of network resources. We first develop techniques to eliminate forwarding redundancy with global network information, and then improve these techniques to be operable in a fully distributed manner with limited network information.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Tennessee", "University of Arkansas", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Wei Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0006:Wei", "Qinghua Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qinghua", "Guohong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Guohong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
