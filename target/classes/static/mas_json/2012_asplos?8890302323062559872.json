However, finding an optimal task assignment for a workload running on MMT processors is an NP-complete problem. Due to the fact that the performance of the best possible task assignment is unknown, the room for improvement of current task-assignment algorithms cannot be determined. This is a major problem for the industry because it could lead to: (1)~A waste of resources if excessive effort is devoted to improving a task assignment algorithm that already provides a performance that is close to the optimal one, or (2)~significant performance loss if insufficient effort is devoted to improving poorly-performing task assignment algorithms.   In this paper, we present a method based on Extreme Value Theory that allows the prediction of the performance of the optimal task assignment in MMT processors. We further show that executing a sample of several hundred or several thousand  random  task assignments is enough to obtain, with very high confidence, an assignment with a performance that is close to the optimal one. We validate our method with an industrial case study for a set of multithreaded network applications running on an UltraSPARC~T2 processor.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Barcelona Supercomputing Center", "Barcelona Supercomputing Center", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Petar Radojkovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radojkovic:Petar", "Vladimir Cakarevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cakarevic:Vladimir", "Miquel Moret\u00f3.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moret=oacute=:Miquel", "Javier Verd\u00fa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verd=uacute=:Javier", "Alex Pajuelo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pajuelo:Alex", "Francisco J.
