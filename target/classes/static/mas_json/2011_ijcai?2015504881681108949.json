{"title": "Making Better Informed Trust Decisions with Generalized Fact-Finding.", "fields": ["computer science", "certainty", "data mining", "fact finding", "information extraction"], "abstract": "Information retrieval may suggest a document, and information extraction may tell us what it says, but which information sources do we trust and which assertions do we believe when different authors make conflicting claims? Trust algorithms known as fact-finders attempt to answer these questions, but consider only which source makes which claim, ignoring a wealth of background knowledge and contextual detail such as the uncertainty in the information extraction of claims from documents, attributes of the sources, the degree of similarity among claims, and the degree of certainty expressed by the sources. We introduce a new, generalized fact-finding framework able to incorporate this additional information into the fact-finding process. Experiments using several state-of-theart fact-finding algorithms demonstrate that generalized fact-finders achieve significantly better performance than their original variants on both semi-synthetic and real-world problems.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jeff Pasternack.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasternack:Jeff", "Dan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Dan"], "pages": 6}
