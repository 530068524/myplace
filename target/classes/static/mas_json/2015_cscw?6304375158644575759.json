{"title": "An Agent for Deception Detection in Discussion Based Environments.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "knowledge management", "deception", "computer science"], "abstract": "Extensive use of computerized forums and chat-rooms provides a modern venue for deception. We propose introducing an agent to assist in detecting and incriminating a deceptive participant. We designed a game, where deception in a text based discussion environment occurs. In this game several participants attempt to collectively detect a deceptive member. We compose an automated agent which participates in this game as a regular player. The goal of the agent is to detect the deceptive participant and alert other members, without raising suspicion itself. We use machine learning on the data collected from human players to design this agent. Extensive evaluation of our agent shows that it succeeds in raising the players collective success rate in catching the deceptive player.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Jerusalem College of Technology", "Bar-Ilan University"], "authors": ["Amos Azaria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azaria:Amos", "Ariella Richardson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Richardson:Ariella", "Sarit Kraus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraus:Sarit"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
