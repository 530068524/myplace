We carried out three studies examining how different color properties (lightness, chroma and hue) and different palette properties (combinations and distribution of colors) contribute to different affective interpretations in information visualization where the numbers of colors is typically smaller than the rich palettes used in design. Our results show how color and palette properties can be manipulated to achieve affective expressiveness even in the small sets of colors used for data encoding in information visualization.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Tableau Softwar ... eattle, WA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Lyn Bartram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartram:Lyn", "Abhisekh Patra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patra:Abhisekh", "Maureen C.
