Our framework is fairly general and relies on the combination of a simple, novel grammar transformation and standard techniques to bring grammars into normal forms.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of St Andrews", "University of Padua"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mark-Jan Nederhof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nederhof:Mark=Jan", "Giorgio Satta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satta:Giorgio"], "pages": 10}
