{"title": "Continuous shape shifting: Enabling loop co-optimization via near-free dynamic code rewriting.", "fields": ["loop tiling", "continuous monitoring", "cache", "network functions virtualization", "rewriting"], "abstract": "The class of optimizations characterized by manipulating a loop's interaction space for improved cache locality and reuse (i.e,  cache tiling / blocking / strip mine and interchange ) are static optimizations requiring a priori information about the microarchitectural and runtime environment of an application binary. However, particularly in datacenter environments, deployed applications face numerous dynamic environments over their lifetimes. As a result, this class of optimizations can result in sub-optimal performance due to the inability to flexibly adapt iteration spaces as cache conditions change at runtime.   This paper introduces continuous shape shifiting, a compilation approach that removes the risks of cache tiling optimizations by dynamically rewriting (and reshaping) deployed, running application code. To realize continuous shape shifting, we present ShapeShifter, a framework for continuous monitoring of co-running applications and their runtime environments to reshape loop iteration spaces and pinpoint near-optimal loop tile configurations. Upon identifying a need for reshaping, a new tiling approach is quickly constructed for the application, new code is dynamically generated and is then seamlessly stitched into the running application with near-zero overhead. Our evaluation on a wide spectrum of runtime scenarios demonstrates that ShapeShifter achieves an average of 10--40% performance improvement (up to 2.4X) on real systems depending on the runtime environment compared to an oracle static loop tiling baseline.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Animesh Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Animesh", "Michael A.
