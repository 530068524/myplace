These discretized operators usually depend on bandwidth parameters whose tuning remains a theoretical and practical problem. In this paper, we address this problem for the unnormalized graph Laplacian by establishing an oracle inequality that opens the door to a well-founded data-driven procedure for the bandwidth selection. Our approach relies on recent results by Lacour and Massart [LM15] on the so-called Lepski's method.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["DATASHAPE", "DATASHAPE", "LSTA"], "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chazal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chazal:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Ilaria Giulini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giulini:Ilaria", "Bertrand Michel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michel:Bertrand"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
