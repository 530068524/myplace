{"title": "Dynamically heterogeneous cores through 3D resource pooling.", "fields": ["multiplexing", "pooling", "microarchitecture", "cellular architecture", "granularity"], "abstract": "This paper describes an architecture for a dynamically heterogeneous processor architecture leveraging 3D stacking technology. Unlike prior work in the 2D plane, the extra dimension makes it possible to share resources at a fine granularity between vertically stacked cores. As a result, each core can grow or shrink resources, as needed by the code running on the core. This architecture, therefore, enables runtime customization of cores at a fine granularity and enables efficient execution at both high and low levels of thread parallelism. This architecture achieves performance gains from 9\u201341%, depending on the number of executing threads, and gains significant advantage in energy efficiency of up to 43%.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Houman Homayoun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Homayoun:Houman", "Vasileios Kontorinis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontorinis:Vasileios", "Amirali Shayan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shayan:Amirali", "Ta-Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Ta=Wei", "Dean M.
