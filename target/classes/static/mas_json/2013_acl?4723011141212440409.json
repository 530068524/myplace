Adopting a classical Bayesian perspective, we performs posterior inference over hundreds of languages, leveraging knowledge of known languages and alphabets to uncover general linguistic patterns of typologically coherent language clusters. We achieve average accuracy in the unsupervised consonant/vowel prediction task of 99% across 503 languages. We further show that our methodology can be used to predict more fine-grained phonetic distinctions. On a three-way classification task between vowels, nasals, and nonnasal consonants, our model yields unsupervised accuracy of 89% across the same set of languages.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Young-Bum Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Young=Bum", "Benjamin Snyder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snyder:Benjamin"], "pages": 10}
