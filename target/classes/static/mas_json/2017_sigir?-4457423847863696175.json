The problem was introduced in CIKM Cup 2016 together with a new dataset provided by Data-Centric Alliance (DCA). In this paper, we present insightful analysis on the dataset and propose a solution to link users based on their visited URLs, visiting time, and profile embeddings. We cast the problem as pairwise classification and use gradient boosting as the leaning-to-rank model. Our model works on a set of features exacted from URLs, titles, time and session data derived from user device-logs. The model outperforms the best solution in the CIKM Cup by a large margin.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Minh C.
