In order to study customized architectures, we model four customization design points and compare their performance and energy across a number of computer vision workloads. We analyze the limitations of generic architectures and quantify the costs of increasing customization using these micro-architectural design points. This analysis leads us to develop a framework consisting of low-power multi-cores and an array of configurable micro-accelerator functional units. Using this platform, we illustrate dataflow and control processing optimizations that provide for performance gains similar to custom ASICs for a wide range of vision benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "University of Bologna", "Pennsylvania State University", "ETH Zurich", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Nandhini Chandramoorthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandramoorthy:Nandhini", "Giuseppe Tagliavini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tagliavini:Giuseppe", "Kevin M.
