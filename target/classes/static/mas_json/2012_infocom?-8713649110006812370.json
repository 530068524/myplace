Our target is to characterize the additional bandwidth that servers must supply to immediately satisfy all requests to watch a given video. We develop an approximate fluid model to compute the required server bandwidth in the sequential delivery case. Our approach is able to capture several stochastic effects related to peer churn, upload bandwidth heterogeneity, non-stationary traffic conditions, which have not been documented or analyzed before. We provide an analytical methodology to design efficient peer-assisted VoD systems and optimal resource allocation strategies.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "Istituto per le ...
