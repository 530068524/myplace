{"title": "The Tree of Knowledge: a localized collective intelligence tool.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "openness to experience", "collective intelligence", "computer science"], "abstract": "In this work, we implemented a localized collective intelligence tool called the Tree of Knowledge that represents the on-going knowledge activities in a building. The Tree of Knowledge can increase the awareness of who knows what in the building and trigger more face-to-face interactions and collaborations. We pointed out the importance of localized, motivation, informal, and openness in designing such collective intelligence tools. Further applications and implications are discussed.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Korea Institute of Science and Technology", "Virginia Tech", "Cisco Systems, Inc."], "authors": ["Gyu Hyun Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Gyu_Hyun", "Yoon Suk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yoon_Suk", "Mithilesh Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0006:Mithilesh"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
