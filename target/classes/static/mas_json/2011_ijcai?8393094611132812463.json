Standard possibilistic logic expressions are propositional logic formulas associated with positive real degrees belonging to [0,1]. However, in practice it may be difficult for an expert to provide exact degrees associated with formulas of a knowledge base.\n\nThis paper proposes a flexible representation of uncertain information where the weights associated with formulas are in the form of intervals. We first study a framework for reasoning with interval-based possibilistic knowledge bases by extending main concepts of possibilistic logic such as the ones of necessity and possibility measures. We then provide a characterization of an interval-based possibilistic logic base by means of a concept of compatible standard possibilistic logic bases. We show that interval-based possibilistic logic extends possibilistic logic in the case where all intervals are singletons. Lastly, we provide computational complexity results of deriving plausible conclusions from interval-based possibilistic bases and we show that the flexibility in representing uncertain information is handled without extra computational costs.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["university of lille", "university of lille", "university of lille", "Paris Descartes University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Salem Benferhat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benferhat:Salem", "Julien Hu\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu=eacute=:Julien", "Sylvain Lagrue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lagrue:Sylvain", "Julien Rossit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossit:Julien"], "pages": 6}
