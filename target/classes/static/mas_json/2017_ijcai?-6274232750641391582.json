Successes in automating supervised learning have not translated to the more ambiguous realm of unsupervised learning where goals and labels are not provided. Barlow (1961) suggested that the signal that brains leverage for unsupervised learning is dependence, or redundancy, in the sensory environment. Dependence can be characterized using the information-theoretic multivariate mutual information measure called total correlation. The principle of Total Correlation Ex-planation (CorEx) is to learn representations of data that \"explain\" as much dependence in the data as possible. We review some manifestations of this principle along with successes in unsupervised learning problems across diverse domains including human behavior, biology, and language.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Southern California"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Greg Ver Steeg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steeg:Greg_Ver"], "pages": 5}
