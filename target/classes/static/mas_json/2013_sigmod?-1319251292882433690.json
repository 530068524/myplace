A major challenge is the ordering of axes, as any axis can have at most two neighbors when placed in parallel on a 2D plane. By extending this concept to a 3D visualization space we can place several axes next to each other. However, finding a good arrangement often does not necessarily become easier, as still not all axes can be arranged pairwise adjacently to each other. Here, we provide a tool to explore complex data sets using 3D-parallel-coordinate-trees, along with a number of approaches to arrange the axes.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Elke Achtert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achtert:Elke", "Hans-Peter Kriegel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kriegel:Hans=Peter", "Erich Schubert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schubert:Erich", "Arthur Zimek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimek:Arthur"], "pages": 4}
