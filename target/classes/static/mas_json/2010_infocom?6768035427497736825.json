As the approximate aggregation results are enough for users to perform analysis and make decisions, many approximate aggregation algorithms are proposed for WSNs. However, most of the algorithms have fixed error bounds and cannot meet arbitrary precision requirement, the uniform sampling based algorithm which can reach arbitrary precision is just suitable for the static networks. Considering the dynamic property of WSNs, in this paper, we propose an approximate aggregation algorithm based on Bernoulli sampling to satisfy arbitrary precision requirement. Besides, two adaptive algorithms are also proposed, one is for adapting the sample with varying of precision requirement, the other is for adapting the sample with varying of sensed data. The theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of accuracy and energy consumption.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Siyao Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Siyao", "Jianzhong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianzhong", "Qianqian Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Qianqian", "Lei Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0002:Lei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
