We argue in this paper that, in both fields, there are good incentives for model-checking sets of parse trees for some word according to a context-free grammar. We put forward the adequacy of propositional dynamic logic (PDL) on trees in these applications, and study as a sanity check the complexity of the corresponding model-checking problem: although complete for exponential time in the general case, we find natural restrictions on grammars for our applications and establish complexities ranging from nondeterministic polynomial time to polynomial space in the relevant cases.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "CMI, Chennai, India"], "authors": ["Anudhyan Boral.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boral:Anudhyan", "Sylvain Schmitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmitz:Sylvain"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
