However, accurately modeling string variables is a challeng- ing problem. Current approaches are generally customized for certain problem domains or have critical limitations in handling loops, providing context-sensitive inter-procedural analysis, and performing efficient analysis on complicated apps. To address these limitations, we propose a general framework, Violist, for string analysis that allows researchers to more flexibly choose how they will address each of these challenges by separating the representation and interpreta- tion of string operations. In our evaluation, we show that our approach can achieve high accuracy on both Java and Android apps in a reasonable amount of time. We also com- pared our approach with a popular and widely used string analyzer and found that our approach has higher precision and shorter execution time while maintaining the same level of recall.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Ding Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ding", "Yingjun Lyu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyu:Yingjun", "Mian Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Mian", "William G.
