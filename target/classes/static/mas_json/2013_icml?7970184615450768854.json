{"title": "Robust Regression on MapReduce.", "fields": ["data set", "linear algebra", "robust regression", "small number", "terabyte"], "abstract": "Although the MapReduce framework is now the de facto standard for analyzing massive data sets, many algorithms (in particular, many iterative algorithms popular in machine learning, optimization, and linear algebra) are hard to fit into MapReduce. Consider, e.g., the lp regression problem: given a matrix A \u2208 Rm\u00d7n and a vector b \u2208 Rm, find a vector x* \u2208 Rn that minimizes f(x) = ||Ax-b||p. The widely-used l2 regression, i.e., linear least-squares, is known to be highly sensitive to outliers; and choosing p \u2208 [1; 2) can help improve robustness. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for solving strongly over-determined (m \u226b n) robust lp regression problems to moderate precision on MapReduce. Our empirical results on data up to the terabyte scale demonstrate that our algorithm is a significant improvement over traditional iterative algorithms on MapReduce for l1 regression, even for a fairly small number of iterations. In addition, our proposed interior-point cutting-plane method can also be extended to solving more general convex problems on MapReduce.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["LinkedIn", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Xiangrui Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Xiangrui", "Michael W.
