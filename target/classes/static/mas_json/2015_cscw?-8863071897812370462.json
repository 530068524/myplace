{"title": "Monetizing Network Hospitality: Hospitality and Sociability in the Context of Airbnb.", "fields": ["social relation", "hospitality", "sharing economy", "qualitative research", "information system"], "abstract": "We present a qualitative study of hospitality exchange processes that take place via the online peer-to-peer platform Airbnb. We explore 1) what motivates individuals to monetize network hospitality and 2) how the presence of money ties in with the social interaction related to network hospitality. We approach the topic from the perspective of hosts -- that is, Airbnb users who participate by offering accommodation for other members in exchange for monetary compensation. We found that participants were motivated to monetize network hospitality for both financial and social reasons. Our analysis indicates that the presence of money can provide a helpful frame for network hospitality, supporting hosts in their efforts to accomplish desired sociability, select guests consistent with their preferences, and control the volume and type of demand. We conclude the paper with a critical discussion of the implications of our findings for network hospitality and, more broadly, for the so-called sharing economy.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "departments": ["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology", "Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"], "authors": ["Tapio Ikkala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikkala:Tapio", "Airi Lampinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampinen:Airi"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
