To generate realistic-looking images with different views from the input, we propose a new image generation model termed VariGANs that combines the strengths of the variational inference and the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our proposed VariGANs model generates the target image in a coarse-to-fine manner instead of a single pass which suffers from severe artifacts. It first performs variational inference to model global appearance of the object (e.g., shape and color) and produce a coarse image with a different view. Conditioned on the generated low resolution images, it then proceeds to perform adversarial learning to fill details and generate images of consistent details with the input. Extensive experiments conducted on two clothing datasets, MVC and DeepFashion, have demonstrated that images of a novel view generated by our model are more plausible than those generated by existing approaches, in terms of more consistent global appearance as well as richer and sharper details.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Southwest Jiaotong University", "Southwest Jiaotong University", "Tencent", "Tencent"], "conf": "mm", "authors": ["Bo Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Bo", "Xiao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Xiao", "Zhi-Qi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Zhi=Qi", "Hao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Hao", "Zequn Jie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jie:Zequn", "Jiashi Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jiashi"], "pages": 9}
