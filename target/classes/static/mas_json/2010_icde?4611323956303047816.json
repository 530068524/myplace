While most existing approaches focus on partitioning the nodes, real-world datasets suggest the presence of overlapping communities. We present OCA, a novel algorithm to detect overlapped communities in large data graphs. It outperforms previous proposals in terms of execution time, and efficiently handles large graphs containing more than 10 8  nodes and edges.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia"], "authors": ["Arnau Padrol-Sureda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padrol=Sureda:Arnau", "Guillem Perarnau-Llobet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perarnau=Llobet:Guillem", "Julian Pfeifle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfeifle:Julian", "Victor Munt\u00e9s-Mulero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munt=eacute=s=Mulero:Victor"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
