In order to achieve this goal, an Image Based Lighting approach is used, where environment maps with different levels of glossiness are generated for each virtual object in the scene at every frame. Due to this, illumination effects, such as color bleeding and specular reflections, can be simulated for virtual objects in a consistent way. A unifying sampling method for the spherical harmonics transformation pass is also used. It is independent of map format and does not need to apply different weights for each sample. The developed technique is combined with an extended version of Lafortune Spatial BRDF, featuring Fresnel effect and an innovative tangent rotation parameterization. The solution is evaluated in various Augmented Reality case studies, where other features like shadowing and lens effects are also exploited.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Federal University of Pernambuco", "Federal University of Pernambuco", "Federal University of Pernambuco", "Federal University of Pernambuco", "Federal University of Pernambuco"], "authors": ["Saulo A.
