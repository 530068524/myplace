We describe variants of SDCA that do not require explicit regularization and do not rely on duality. We prove linear convergence rates even if individual loss functions are non-convex, as long as the expected loss is strongly convex.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Shai Shalev-Shwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalev=Shwartz:Shai"], "pages": 8}
