Asking queries can help improve behavior, but if queries come at a cost (e.g., due to limited operator attention), the number of queries needs to be minimized. We develop a new algorithm for selecting action queries by adapting the recently proposed Expected Myopic Gain (EMG) from its prior use in settings with reward or transition probability queries to our setting of action queries, and empirically compare it to the current state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Robert Cohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohn:Robert", "Edmund H.
