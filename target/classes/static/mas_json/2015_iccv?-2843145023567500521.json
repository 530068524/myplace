Re-identifications from multiple cameras are regarded as related tasks to exploit shared information to improve re-identification accuracy. Both low level features and semantic/data-driven attributes are utilized. Since attributes are generally correlated, we introduce a low rank attribute embedding into the MTL formulation to embed original binary attributes to a continuous attribute space, where incorrect and incomplete attributes are rectified and recovered to better describe people. The learning objective function consists of a quadratic loss regarding class labels and an attribute embedding error, which is solved by an alternating optimization procedure. Experiments on three person re-identification datasets have demonstrated that MTL-LORAE outperforms existing approaches by a large margin and produces state-of-the-art results.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Peking University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Peking University", "University of Texas at San Antonio", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Chi Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Chi", "Fan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0016:Fan", "Shiliang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shiliang", "Qi Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Qi", "Larry S.
