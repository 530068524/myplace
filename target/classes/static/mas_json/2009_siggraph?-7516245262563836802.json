He worked on two luxury round-the-world cruiseships launched in 1939, Argentina Maru and Brasil Maru. The two ships were the culmination of Japan's shipbuilding and industrial design technology. Murano was in charge of designing the interior of the first-class lounge and dining room. The ships were destroyed in the war and swallowed up by the sea. Now, over 60 years later, the glory of the two legendary liners has been revived from their original plans. This film introduces the beauty of the breathtaking interior, which has been reconstructed as it was 60 years ago.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Japan"], "authors": ["Tomoko Nagai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagai:Tomoko"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
