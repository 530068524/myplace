During the execution of a kernel, all streams accessed must be communicated through the SRF (Stream Register File), a non-bypassing software-managed on-chip memory. Therefore, optimizing utilization of the SRF is crucial for good performance. The key insight is that the interference graphs formed by the streams in stream applications tend to be comparability graphs or decomposable into a set of multiple comparability graphs. We present a compiler algorithm that can find optimal or near-optimal colorings in stream IGs, thereby improving SRF utilization than the First-Fit   bin-packing algorithm, the best in the literature.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "National Labora ...
