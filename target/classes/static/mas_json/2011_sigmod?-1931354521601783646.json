{"title": "Keyword search over relational databases: a metadata approach.", "fields": ["query by example", "spatial query", "null", "nested set model", "data definition language"], "abstract": "Keyword queries offer a convenient alternative to traditional SQL in querying relational databases with large, often unknown, schemas and instances. The challenge in answering such queries is to discover their intended semantics, construct the SQL queries that describe them and used them to retrieve the respective tuples. Existing approaches typically rely on indices built a-priori on the database content. This seriously limits their applicability if a-priori access to the database content is not possible. Examples include the on-line databases accessed through web interface, or the sources in information integration systems that operate behind wrappers with specific query capabilities. Furthermore, existing literature has not studied to its full extend the inter-dependencies across the ways the different keywords are mapped into the database values and schema elements. In this work, we describe a novel technique for translating keyword queries into SQL based on the Munkres (a.k.a. Hungarian) algorithm. Our approach not only tackles the above two limitations, but it offers significant improvements in the identification of the semantically meaningful SQL queries that describe the intended keyword query semantics. We provide details of the technique implementation and an extensive experimental evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "University of Zaragoza", "University of Trento"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sonia Bergamaschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergamaschi:Sonia", "Elton Domnori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Domnori:Elton", "Francesco Guerra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerra_0001:Francesco", "Raquel Trillo Lado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lado:Raquel_Trillo", "Yannis Velegrakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Velegrakis:Yannis"], "pages": 12}
