{"title": "Showing versus doing: Teaching by demonstration.", "fields": ["computer science", "machine learning", "reinforcement learning", "artificial intelligence", "bayesian inference"], "abstract": "People often learn from others' demonstrations, and classic inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms have brought us closer to realizing this capacity in machines. In contrast, teaching by demonstration has been less well studied computationally. Here, we develop a novel Bayesian model for teaching by demonstration. Stark differences arise when demonstrators are intentionally teaching a task versus simply performing a task. In two experiments, we show that human participants systematically modify their teaching behavior consistent with the predictions of our model. Further, we show that even standard IRL algorithms benefit when learning from behaviors that are intentionally pedagogical. We conclude by discussing IRL algorithms that can take advantage of intentional pedagogy.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University", "Harvard University", "Brown University"], "authors": ["Mark K.
