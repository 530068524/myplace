Despite the subtleties in their designs, previous methods estimate the tag cardinality from the slot measurements, which distinguish idle and busy slots and based on that derive the cardinality following some probability models. In order to fundamentally improve the counting efficiency, in this paper we introduce PLACE, a physical layer based cardinality estimator. We show that it is possible to extract more information and infer integer states from the same slots in RFID communications. We propose a joint estimator that optimally combines multiple sub-estimators, each of which independently counts the number of tags with different inferred PHY states. Extensive experiments based on the GNURadio/USRP platform and the large-scale simulations demonstrate that PLACE achieves approximately 3\u223c4\u00d7 performance improvement over state-of-the-art cardinality estimation approaches.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Yuxiao Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:Yuxiao", "Jiajue Ou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ou:Jiajue", "Yuanqing Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yuanqing", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
