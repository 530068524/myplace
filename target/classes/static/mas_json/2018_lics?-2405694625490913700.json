{"title": "Conditional Value-at-Risk for Reachability and Mean Payoff in Markov Decision Processes.", "fields": ["cvar", "quantile", "stochastic game", "markov decision process", "expected shortfall"], "abstract": "We present the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in the context of Markov chains and Markov decision processes with reachability and mean-payoff objectives. CVaR quantifies risk by means of the expectation of the worst p-quantile. As such it can be used to design risk-averse systems. We consider not only CVaR constraints, but also introduce their conjunction with expectation constraints and quantile constraints (value-at-risk, VaR). We derive lower and upper bounds on the computational complexity of the respective decision problems and characterize the structure of the strategies in terms of memory and randomization.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Jan Kret\u00ednsk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kret=iacute=nsk=yacute=:Jan", "Tobias Meggendorfer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meggendorfer:Tobias"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
