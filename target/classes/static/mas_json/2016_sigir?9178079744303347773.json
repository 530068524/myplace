{"title": "Predicting Search User Examination with Visual Saliency.", "fields": ["eye tracking", "salience", "interaction information", "saliency map", "search engine"], "abstract": "Predicting users' examination of search results is one of the key concerns in Web search related studies. With more and more heterogeneous components federated into search engine result pages (SERPs), it becomes difficult for traditional position-based models to accurately predict users' actual examination patterns. Therefore, a number of prior works investigate the connection between examination and users' explicit interaction behaviors (e.g.~click-through, mouse movement). Although these works gain much success in predicting users' examination behavior on SERPs, they require the collection of large scale user behavior data, which makes it impossible to predict examination behavior on newly-generated SERPs. To predict user examination on SERPs containing heterogenous components without user interaction information, we propose a new prediction model based on visual saliency map and page content features. Visual saliency, which is designed to measure the likelihood of a given area to attract human visual attention, is used to predict users' attention distribution on heterogenous search components. With an experimental search engine, we carefully design a user study in which users' examination behavior (eye movement) is recorded. Examination prediction results based on this collected data set demonstrate that visual saliency features significantly improve the performance of examination model in heterogeneous search environments. We also found that saliency features help predict internal examination behavior within vertical results.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Yahoo!", "Hefei University of Technology", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yiqun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yiqun", "Zeyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zeyang", "Ke Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Ke", "Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Meng", "Huanbo Luan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luan:Huanbo", "Chao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chao", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Min", "Shaoping Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shaoping"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
