In this paper we explore different user interfaces for undo/redo for co-located collaborative workspaces, such as large interactive whiteboards. A preliminary study revealed that users expect neither a global nor personal undo, but rather a regional undo. We propose and evaluate three automatic regional undo/redo techniques (clustering, workspace, field of view) designed for a large interactive whiteboard. The results of the evaluation showed that an undo technique based on users' field of view was most preferred, while the content-based clustering technique produced most errors. We conclude with potential improvements to the developed techniques, and propose a set of design recommendations for implementing regional undo/redo on large interactive surfaces.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Media Interacti ... enberg, Austria", "Media Interacti ... enberg, Austria", "Media Interacti ... enberg, Austria"], "authors": ["Thomas Seifried.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seifried:Thomas", "Christian Rendl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rendl:Christian", "Michael Haller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haller:Michael", "Stacey D.
