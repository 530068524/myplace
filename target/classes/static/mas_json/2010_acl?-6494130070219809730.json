Both of them have been repeatedly addressed in NLP. This paper is the first comprehensive and systematic review of the existing computational models of metaphor, the issues of metaphor annotation in corpora and the available resources.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Cambridge"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ekaterina Shutova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shutova:Ekaterina"], "pages": 10}
