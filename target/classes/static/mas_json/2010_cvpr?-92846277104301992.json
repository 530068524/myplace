{"title": "Posture invariant surface description and feature extraction.", "fields": ["mesh generation", "invariant", "pose", "spin", "polygon mesh"], "abstract": "We propose a posture invariant surface descriptor for triangular meshes. Using intrinsic geometry, the surface is first transformed into a representation that is independent of the posture. Spin image is then adapted to derive a descriptor for the representation. The descriptor is used for extracting surface features automatically. It is invariant with respect to rigid and isometric deformations, and robust to noise and changes in resolution. The result is demonstrated by using the automatically extracted features to find correspondences between articulated meshes.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National Research Council", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "National Research Council"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Stefanie Wuhrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wuhrer:Stefanie", "Zouhour Ben Azouz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azouz:Zouhour_Ben", "Chang Shu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shu_0001:Chang"], "pages": 8}
