In this paper we discuss this topic through the Japanese concept of Wabi-Sabi, a philosophy that embraces three basic realities of the material world: 'nothing lasts', 'nothing is finished', and 'nothing is perfect'. We use these concepts to reflect on four unique interactive artefacts, which all in different ways embrace aspects of Wabi-Sabi, in terms of their design gestalt, materiality, but also in terms of use practices. Further, we use our analysis to articulate three high-level principles that may help addressing the long-term realities faced in physical interaction design, and for the design of interactive systems in general.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Vasiliki Tsaknaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsaknaki:Vasiliki", "Ylva Fernaeus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fernaeus:Ylva"], "pages": 14}
