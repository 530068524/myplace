{"title": "Using a Recursive Neural Network to Learn an Agent's Decision Model for Plan Recognition.", "fields": ["data mining", "decision model", "situation awareness", "recurrent neural network", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Plan recognition, the problem of inferring the goals or plans of an observed agent, is a key element of situation awareness in human-machine and machine-machine interactions for many applications. Some plan recognition algorithms require knowledge about the potential behaviours of the observed agent in the form of a plan library, together with a decision model about how the observed agent uses the plan library to make decisions. It is however difficult to elicit and specify the decision model a priori. In this paper, we present a recursive neural network model that learns such a decision model automatically. We discuss promising experimental results of the approach with comparisons to selected state-of-the-art plan recognition algorithms on three benchmark domains.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke", "Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke", "Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"], "authors": ["Francis Bisson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bisson:Francis", "Hugo Larochelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larochelle:Hugo", "Froduald Kabanza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kabanza:Froduald"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
