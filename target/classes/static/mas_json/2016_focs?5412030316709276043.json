Previously, no explicit examples of $n$-dimensional $0/1$-polytopes were known with extension complexity larger than exponential in $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$. Our construction is inspired by a relatively little-known connection between extended formulations and (monotone) circuit depth.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "National University of Singapore", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Mika G\u00f6\u00f6s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml==ouml=s:Mika", "Rahul Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0001:Rahul", "Thomas Watson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watson_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
