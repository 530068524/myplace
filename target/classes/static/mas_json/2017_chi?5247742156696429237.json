And despite the ubiquitous nature of technology in society, digital participation methods are rarely used. In this paper, we outline fieldwork with two neighbourhood planning groups who used participatory media technology to improve engagement though the art of storytelling. We focus on the configuration of participatory media as a way to widen participation and enable story creation and sharing amongst citizens. We highlight that storytelling using media technology can provide a model of and a model for the way we \"do\" neighbourhood planning whilst emphasising the challenges of ensuring processes are linked to tangible actions and encouraging the multiplicity of stories.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jennifer Manuel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manuel:Jennifer", "Geoff Vigar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vigar:Geoff", "Tom Bartindale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartindale:Tom", "Rob Comber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Comber:Rob"], "pages": 14}
