The multi-view augmented reality technique introduces two correlating displays; i) a perspective egocentric view with focused edge overlay and focused geometry clipping and ii) an orthographic cut-away display that visualizes a thin slice of subterranean data intersecting a user controlled anchor.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Sabanc\u0131 University", "Sabanc\u0131 University", "Sabanc\u0131 University"], "authors": ["Mustafa Tolga Eren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eren:Mustafa_Tolga", "Murat Cansoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cansoy:Murat", "Selim Balcisoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balcisoy:Selim"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
