We provide theory showing this new approach is consistent for models with long range structure, and apply the approach to motion capture and high-dimensional video data, yielding results superior to standard alternatives.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "University of Toronto", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["John Langford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langford_0001:John", "Ruslan Salakhutdinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salakhutdinov:Ruslan", "Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Tong"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
