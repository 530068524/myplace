Previous provisioning approaches have started with a fixed set of requirements and the goal of automatically finding minimum cost solutions to meet them. Such approaches neglect the cost-benefit analysis of the purchasing decision.\n\nPurchasing a storage system involves an extensive set of trade-offs between metrics such as purchase cost, performance, reliability, availability, power, etc. Increases in one metric have consequences for others, and failing to account for these trade-offs can lead to a poor return on the storage investment. Using a collection of storage acquisition and provisioning scenarios, we show that utility functions enable this cost-benefit structure to be conveyed to an automated provisioning tool, enabling the tool to make appropriate trade-offs between different system metrics including performance, data protection, and purchase cost.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["John D.
