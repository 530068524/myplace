Since the all-zero assignment always satisfies all the equations exactly, we restrict the assignments to be \"non-trivial\". Here is an informal statement of our result: it is NP-hard to distinguish whether there is a non-trivial assignment that satisfies 1-\u03b4 fraction of the equations or every non-trivial assignment fails to satisfy a constant fraction of the equations with a \"margin\" of \u03a9(\u221a\u03b4).   We develop linearity and dictatorship testing procedures for functions f: R n  -> R over a Gaussian space, which could be of independent interest.   We believe that studying the complexity of linear equations over reals, apart from being a natural pursuit, can lead to progress on the Unique Games Conjecture.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "NYU, New York, USA"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Subhash Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Subhash", "Dana Moshkovitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moshkovitz:Dana"], "pages": 8}
