{"title": "Nb-GCLOCK: A non-blocking buffer management based on the generalized CLOCK.", "fields": ["page replacement algorithm", "distributed computing", "write buffer", "hash table", "scalability"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a non-blocking buffer management scheme based on a lock-free variant of the GCLOCK page replacement algorithm. Concurrent access to the buffer management module is a major factor that prevents database scalability to processors. Therefore, we propose a non-blocking scheme for bufferfix operations that fix buffer frames for requested pages without locks by combining Nb-GCLOCK and a non-blocking hash table. Our experimental results revealed that our scheme can obtain nearly linear scalability to processors up to 64 processors, although the existing locking-based schemes do not scale beyond 16 processors.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Waseda University", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Sangyo University", "Waseda University"], "authors": ["Makoto Yui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yui:Makoto", "Jun Miyazaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miyazaki:Jun", "Shunsuke Uemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uemura:Shunsuke", "Hayato Yamana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamana:Hayato"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
