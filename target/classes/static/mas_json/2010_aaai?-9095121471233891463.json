In contrast, biological systems can achieve intelligent group behaviors with each agent performing simple sensing and actions. We summarize our recent papers on a biologically-inspired control framework for multi-agent tasks that is based on a simple and iterative control law. We theoretically analyze important aspects of this decentralized approach, such as the convergence and scalability, and further demonstrate how this approach applies to real-world applications with a diverse set of multi-agent applications. These results provide a deeper understanding of the contrast between centralized and decentralized algorithms in multi-agent tasks and autonomous robot control.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering", "Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering"], "authors": ["Chih-Han Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Chih=Han", "Radhika Nagpal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagpal:Radhika"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
