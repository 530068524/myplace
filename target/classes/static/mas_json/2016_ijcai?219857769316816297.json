Based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we formulate the original convex minimization problem as a feed-forward neural network, named Deep l\u221e Encoder, by introducing the novel Bounded Linear Unit (BLU) neuron and modeling the Lagrange multipliers as network biases. Such a structural prior acts as an effective network regularization, and facilitates the model initialization. We then investigate the effective use of the proposed model in the application of hashing, by coupling the proposed encoders under a supervised pairwise loss, to develop a Deep Siamese l\u221e Network, which can be optimized from end to end. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive performances of the proposed model. We also provide an in-depth analysis of its behaviors against the competitors.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "University of Michigan", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "French Institute of Health and Medical Research", "University of Western Ontario", "Tianjin University", "University of Western Ontario", "Tianjin University", "Tianjin University", "Tianjin University", "Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University", "Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University", "Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University", "Quantmetry, Paris, France", "Quantmetry, Paris, France", "Quantmetry, Paris, France"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhangyang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhangyang", "Yingzhen Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yingzhen", "Shiyu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Shiyu", "Qing Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Qing", "Thomas S.
