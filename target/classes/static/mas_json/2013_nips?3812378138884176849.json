Though these designs correct external errors in recall, they assume neurons compute noiselessly, in contrast to highly variable neurons in hippocampus and olfactory cortex. Here we consider associative memories with noisy internal computations and analytically characterize performance. As long as internal noise is less than a specified threshold, error probability in the recall phase can be made exceedingly small. More surprisingly, we show internal noise actually improves performance of the recall phase. Computational experiments lend additional support to our theoretical analysis. This work suggests a functional benefit to noisy neurons in biological neuronal networks.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "IBM"], "authors": ["Amin Karbasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karbasi:Amin", "Amir Hesam Salavati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salavati:Amir_Hesam", "Amin Shokrollahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shokrollahi:Amin", "Lav R.
