We study an optimization problem for multi-hop link scheduling with bandwidth and delay guarantees over WRNs. Our optimization problem is investigated under a general interference model with a generic objective. The objective can be based on various kinds of performance indexes (e.g., throughput, fairness and capacity) determined by service providers. We present efficient algorithms for maximizing the objective function. The experimental results indicate that our presented algorithms yield near-optimal performance.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Chi-Yao Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Chi=Yao", "Ai-Chun Pang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pang:Ai=Chun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
