{"title": "Automatic Verification of Integer Array Programs.", "fields": ["transitive closure", "variable", "decidability", "integer", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We provide a verification technique for a class of programs working on  integer arrays  of finite, but not a priori bounded length. We use the logic of integer arrays SIL [13] to specify pre- and post-conditions of programs and their parts. Effects of non-looping parts of code are computed syntactically on the level of SIL. Loop pre-conditions derived during the computation in SIL are converted into counter automata (CA). Loops are automatically translated--purely on the syntactical level--to transducers. Pre-condition CA and transducers are composed, and the composition over-approximated by flat automata with difference bound constraints, which are next converted back into SIL formulae, thus inferring post-conditions of the loops. Finally, validity of post-conditions specified by the user in SIL may be checked as entailment is decidable for SIL.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "LIAFA, Paris 13, France 75205", "FIT BUT, Brno,  ...
