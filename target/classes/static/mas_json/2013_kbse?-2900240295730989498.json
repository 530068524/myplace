Robustness can be tested by deliberately exposing the system to erroneous events during its execution, and then analyzing the OS behavior to evaluate its ability to gracefully handle these events. Since OSs are complex and stateful systems, robustness testing needs to account for the timing of erroneous events, in order to evaluate the robust behavior of the OS under different  states . This paper presents SABRINE (StAte-Based Robustness testIng of operatiNg systEms), an approach for state-aware robustness testing of OSs. SABRINE automatically extracts state models from execution traces, and generates a set of test cases that cover different OS states. We evaluate the approach on a Linux-based Real-Time Operating System adopted in the avionic domain. Experimental results show that SABRINE can automatically identify relevant OS states, and find robustness vulnerabilities while keeping low the number of test cases.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["DIETI Departmen ... , Napoli, Italy", "DIETI Departmen ... , Napoli, Italy", "DIETI Departmen ... , Napoli, Italy", "DIETI Departmen ... , Napoli, Italy"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Domenico Cotroneo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cotroneo:Domenico", "Domenico Di Leo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leo:Domenico_Di", "Francesco Fucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fucci:Francesco", "Roberto Natella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Natella:Roberto"], "pages": 11}
