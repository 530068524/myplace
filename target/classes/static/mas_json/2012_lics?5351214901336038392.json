This construction provides ordinal-recursive lower bounds on the complexity of the main decidable properties (safety, termination, regular simulation, etc.) of these models. Since these new lower bounds match the upper bounds that one can derive from wqo theory, they precisely characterise the computational power of these so-called \"enriched\" nets.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan"], "authors": ["Serge Haddad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haddad:Serge", "Sylvain Schmitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmitz:Sylvain", "Philippe Schnoebelen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schnoebelen:Philippe"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
