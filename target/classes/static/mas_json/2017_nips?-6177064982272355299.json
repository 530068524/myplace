{"title": "Good Semi-supervised Learning That Requires a Bad GAN.", "fields": ["discriminator", "semi supervised learning", "generative grammar", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) obtained strong empirical results, but it is not clear 1) how the discriminator benefits from joint training with a generator, and 2) why good semi-supervised classification performance and a good generator cannot be obtained at the same time. Theoretically we show that given the discriminator objective, good semi-supervised learning indeed requires a bad generator, and propose the definition of a preferred generator. Empirically, we derive a novel formulation based on our analysis that substantially improves over feature matching GANs, obtaining state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zihang Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Zihang", "Zhilin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhilin", "Fan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Fan", "William W.
