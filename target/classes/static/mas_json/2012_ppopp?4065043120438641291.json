{"title": "Faster topology-aware collective algorithms through non-minimal communication.", "fields": ["parallel computing", "torus", "clos network", "semantics", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Known algorithms for two important collective communication operations, allgather and reduce-scatter, are minimal-communication algorithms; no process sends or receives more than the minimum amount of data. This, combined with the data-ordering semantics of the operations, limits the flexibility and performance of these algorithms. Our novel non-minimal, topology-aware algorithms deliver far better performance with the addition of a very small amount of redundant communication. We develop novel algorithms for Clos networks and single or multi-ported torus networks. Tests on a 32k-node BlueGene/P result in allgather speedups of up to 6x and reduce-scatter speedups of over 11x compared to the native IBM algorithm. Broadcast, reduce, and allreduce can be composed of allgather or reduce-scatter and other collective operations; our techniques also improve the performance of these algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Paul Sack.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sack:Paul", "William Gropp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gropp:William"], "pages": 10}
