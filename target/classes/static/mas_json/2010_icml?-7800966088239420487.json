The model can be used to locate change points in an online manner; and, unlike other Bayesian online change point detection algorithms, is applicable when temporal correlations in a regime are expected. We show three variations on how to apply Gaussian processes in the change point context, each with their own advantages. We present methods to reduce the computational burden of these models and demonstrate it on several real world data sets.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Yunus Saatci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saatci:Yunus", "Ryan D.
