Since the program for a single task is underdetermined by its data, we introduce a nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian prior over programs which shares statistical strength across multiple tasks. The key challenge is to parametrize this multi-task sharing. For this, we introduce a new representation of programs based on combinatory logic and provide an MCMC algorithm that can perform safe program transformations on this representation to reveal shared inter-program substructures.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy", "Michael I.
