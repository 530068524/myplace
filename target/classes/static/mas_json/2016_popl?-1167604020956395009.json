In contrast with applicative bisimulations, environmental bisimulations are known to be more robust and do not require sophisticated techniques such as Howe\u2019s in the proofs of congruence. As representative calculi, call-by-name and call-by-value \u03bb- calculus, and a (call-by-value) \u03bb-calculus extended with references (i.e., a store) are considered. In each case full abstraction results are derived for probabilistic environmental similarity and bisimilarity with respect to contextual preorder and contextual equivalence, respectively. Some possible enhancements of the (bi)simulations, as \u2018up-to techniques\u2019, are also presented. Probabilities force a number of modifications to the definition of environmental bisimulations in non-probabilistic languages. Some of these modifications are specific to probabilities, others may be seen as general refinements of environmental bisimulations, applicable also to non-probabilistic languages. Several examples are presented, to illustrate the modifications and the differences.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Bologna", "University of Bologna"], "authors": ["Davide Sangiorgi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sangiorgi:Davide", "Valeria Vignudelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vignudelli:Valeria"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
