Several papers have been published on the problem of visual emotion analysis. In particular, attempts have been made to analyze and predict people's emotional reaction towards images. To this end, different kinds of hand-tuned features are proposed. The results reported on several carefully selected and labeled small image data sets have confirmed the promise of such features. While the recent successes of many computer vision related tasks are due to the adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), visual emotion analysis has not achieved the same level of success. This may be primarily due to the unavailability of confidently labeled and relatively large image data sets for visual emotion analysis. In this work, we introduce a new data set, which started from 3+ million weakly labeled images of different emotions and ended up 30 times as large as the current largest publicly available visual emotion data set. We hope that this data set encourages further research on visual emotion analysis. We also perform extensive benchmarking analyses on this large data set using the state of the art methods including CNNs.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "Adobe Systems", "Snapchat Inc, Venice, CA"], "authors": ["Quanzeng You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Quanzeng", "Jiebo Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Jiebo", "Hailin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Hailin", "Jianchao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jianchao"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
