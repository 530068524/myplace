Knowledge is often hidden in the complex structure and attributes inside these networks. While querying and mining these linked datasets are essential for various applications, traditional graph queries may not be able to capture the rich semantics in these networks. With the advent of complex information networks, new graph queries are emerging, including graph pattern matching and mining, similarity search, ranking and expert finding, graph aggregation and OLAP. These queries require both the topology and content information of the network data, and hence, different from classical graph algorithms such as shortest path, reach ability and minimum cut, which depend only on the structure of the network. In this tutorial, we shall give an introduction of the emerging graph queries, their indexing and resolution techniques, the current challenges and the future research directions.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Arijit Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Arijit", "Yinghui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yinghui", "Xifeng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Xifeng"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
