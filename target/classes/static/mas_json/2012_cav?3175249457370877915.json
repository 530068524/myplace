{"title": "MGSyn: Automatic Synthesis for Industrial Automation.", "fields": ["linear temporal logic", "executable", "toolbox", "modular design", "interconnection"], "abstract": "MGSyn is a programming toolbox based on game-theoretic notions of synthesis for generating production code in the domain of industrial automation. Instead of painstakingly engineering sequences of relatively low-level program code, the designer selects pre-defined hardware components together with behavioral interfaces from a given library, specifies a topology for the interconnection of components, and specifies the programming/synthesis problem in terms of what needs to be achieved. Given the model and a problem specification, MGSyn synthesizes executable C/C++ code for a concrete execution platform and an interactive simulator. The synthesized code is used to control distributed industry-standard PLCs in a FESTO modular production system.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "fortiss GmbH, M ... nchen, Germany", "fortiss GmbH, M ... nchen, Germany", "fortiss GmbH, M ... nchen, Germany"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Chih-Hong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Chih=Hong", "Michael Geisinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geisinger:Michael", "Harald Ruess.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruess:Harald", "Christian Buckl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buckl:Christian", "Alois Knoll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knoll:Alois"], "pages": 7}
