{"title": "Quantum Divide-and-Conquer Anchoring for Separable Non-negative Matrix Factorization.", "fields": ["matrix decomposition", "non negative matrix factorization", "speedup", "quantum algorithm", "quantum state"], "abstract": "It is NP-complete to find non-negative factors $W$ and $H$ with fixed rank $r$ from a non-negative matrix $X$ by minimizing $\\|X-WH^\\top\\|_F^2$. Although the separability assumption (all data points are in the conical hull of the extreme rows) enables polynomial-time algorithms, the computational cost is not affordable for big data. This paper investigates how the power of quantum computation can be capitalized to solve the non-negative matrix factorization with the separability assumption (SNMF) by devising a quantum algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer anchoring (DCA) scheme. The design of quantum DCA (QDCA) is challenging. In the divide step, the random projections in DCA is completed by a quantum algorithm for linear operations, which achieves the exponential speedup. We then devise a heuristic post-selection procedure which extracts the information of anchors stored in the quantum states efficiently. Under a plausible assumption, QDCA performs efficiently, achieves the quantum speedup, and is beneficial for high dimensional problems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Baidu", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Sydney"], "authors": ["Yuxuan Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Yuxuan", "Tongliang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tongliang", "Yinan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yinan", "Runyao Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Runyao", "Dacheng Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Dacheng"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
