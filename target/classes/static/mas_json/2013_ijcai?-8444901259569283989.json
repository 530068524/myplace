{"title": "Discovering Alignments in Ontologies of Linked Data.", "fields": ["linked data", "rdf", "interoperability", "semantic web", "ontology"], "abstract": "Recently, large amounts of data are being published using Semantic Web standards. Simultaneously, there has been a steady rise in links between objects from multiple sources. However, the ontologies behind these sources have remained largely disconnected, thereby challenging the interoperability goal of the Semantic Web. We address this problem by automatically finding alignments between concepts from multiple linked data sources. Instead of only considering the existing concepts in each ontology, we hypothesize new composite concepts, defined using conjunctions and disjunctions of (RDF) types and value restrictions, and generate alignments between them. In addition, our techniques provide a novel method for curating the linked data web by pointing to likely incorrect or missing assertions. Our approach provides a deeper understanding of the relationships between linked data sources and increases the interoperability among previously disconnected ontologies.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Rahul Parundekar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parundekar:Rahul", "Craig A.
