The question is a sequence of words represented in a form convenient for the user, such as a spoken utterance or a handwritten phrase. The question is transduced into a signal that is converted into a sequence of symbols. A set of hypotheses is generated from the sequence of symbols. The hypotheses are sequences of words represented in a form suitable for use by the computer, such as text. One or more information retrieval queries are constructed and executed to retrieve documents from a corpus (database). Retrieved documents are analyzed to produce an evaluation of the hypotheses of the set and to select one or more preferred hypotheses from the set. The preferred hypotheses are output to a display, speech synthesizer, or applications program. Additionally, retrieved documents relevant to the preferred hypotheses can be selected and output.", "citation": "Citations (395)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Xerox", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "University of Tokyo", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "PARC", "PARC", "PARC", "University of Minnesota", "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "PARC", "PARC", "PARC", "Institute of Te ... , Nagoya, fujii"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Roy Josef Jevnisek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jevnisek:Roy_Josef", "Shai Avidan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avidan:Shai"], "pages": 9}
