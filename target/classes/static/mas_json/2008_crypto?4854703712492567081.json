The best known example of such a bug is the Intel division bug, which resulted in slightly inaccurate results for extremely rare inputs. Whereas in most applications such bugs can be viewed as a minor nuisance, we show that in the case of RSA (even when protected by OAEP), Pohlig-Hellman, elliptic curve cryptography, and several other schemes, such bugs can be a security disaster: Decrypting ciphertexts on  any computer which multiplies  even one pair of numbers incorrectly can lead to full leakage of the secret key, sometimes with a single well-chosen ciphertext.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Eli Biham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biham:Eli", "Yaniv Carmeli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carmeli:Yaniv", "Adi Shamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamir:Adi"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 20}
