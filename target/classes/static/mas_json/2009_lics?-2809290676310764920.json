{"title": "Wreath Products of Forest Algebras, with Applications to Tree Logics.", "fields": ["t norm fuzzy logics", "monoidal t norm logic", "ctl", "ancestor", "mathematical proof", "wreath product"], "abstract": "We use the recently developed theory of forest algebras to find algebraic characterizations of the languages of unranked trees and forests definable in various logics. These include the temporal logics {CTL} and { EF}, and first-order logic over the ancestor relation. While the characterizations are in general non-effective, we are able to use them to formulate necessary conditions for definability and provide new proofs that a number of languages are not definable in these logics.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "Boston College", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Mikolaj Bojanczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bojanczyk:Mikolaj", "Howard Straubing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Straubing:Howard", "Igor Walukiewicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walukiewicz:Igor"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
