The distributed reconstruction pipeline is based on state-of-the-art approaches to visual SLAM and variational depth map fusion, and is designed to exploit the individual capabilities of the system components. Results are visualized in real-time on a tablet interface, which gives the user the opportunity to interact. We demonstrate the performance of our approach by capturing several indoor and outdoor scenes on-the-fly and by evaluating our results with respect to a ground-truth model.", "citation": "Citations (113)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Andreas Wendel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wendel:Andreas", "Michael Maurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maurer:Michael", "Gottfried Graber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Graber:Gottfried", "Thomas Pock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pock:Thomas", "Horst Bischof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischof:Horst"], "pages": 8}
