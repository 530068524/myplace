{"title": "Privacy dictionary: a linguistic taxonomy of privacy for content analysis.", "fields": ["data mining", "prototype theory", "content analysis", "computer science", "privacy software"], "abstract": "Privacy is frequently a key concern relating to technology and central to HCI research, yet it is notoriously difficult to study in a naturalistic way. In this paper we describe and evaluate a dictionary of privacy designed for content analysis, derived using prototype theory and informed by traditional theoretical approaches to privacy. We evaluate our dictionary categories alongside privacy-related categories from an existing content analysis tool, LIWC, using verbal discussions of privacy issues from a variety of technology and non-technology contexts. We find that our privacy dictionary is better able to distinguish between privacy and non-privacy language, and is less context-dependent than LIWC. However, the more general LIWC categories are able to describe a greater amount of variation in our data. We discuss possible improvements to the privacy dictionary and note future work.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "University of Bath", "University of Oxford", "University of Bath"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alastair J.
