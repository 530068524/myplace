{"title": "Learning Dynamic Feature Selection for Fast Sequential Prediction.", "fields": ["parsing", "benchmarking", "named entity recognition", "dependency grammar", "dot product"], "abstract": "We present paired learning and inference algorithms for significantly reducing computation and increasing speed of the vector dot products in the classifiers that are at the heart of many NLP components. This is accomplished by partitioning the features into a sequence of templates which are ordered such that high confidence can often be reached using only a small fraction of all features. Parameter estimation is arranged to maximize accuracy and early confidence in this sequence. Our approach is simpler and better suited to NLP than other related cascade methods. We present experiments in left-to-right part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and transition-based dependency parsing. On the typical benchmarking datasets we can preserve POS tagging accuracy above 97% and parsing LAS above 88.5% both with over a five-fold reduction in run-time, and NER F1 above 88 with more than 2x increase in speed.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Emma Strubell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strubell:Emma", "Luke Vilnis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vilnis:Luke", "Kate Silverstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silverstein:Kate", "Andrew McCallum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCallum:Andrew"], "pages": 10}
