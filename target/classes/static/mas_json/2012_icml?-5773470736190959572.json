{"title": "Tighter Variational Representations of f-Divergences via Restriction to Probability Measures.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "estimator", "probability measure", "minimax estimator", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We show that the variational representations for f-divergences currently used in the literature can be tightened. This has implications to a number of methods recently proposed based on this representation. As an example application we use our tighter representation to derive a general f-divergence estimator based on two i.i.d. samples and derive the dual program for this estimator that performs well empirically. We also point out a connection between our estimator and MMD.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "NICTA", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Avraham Ruderman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruderman:Avraham", "Mark D.
