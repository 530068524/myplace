A number of computer vision problems can be framed in this manner including multi-person pose estimation, instance segmentation, and multi-object tracking. Usually the grouping of detections is achieved with multi-stage pipelines, instead we propose an approach that teaches a network to simultaneously output detections and group assignments. This technique can be easily integrated into any state-of-the-art network architecture that produces pixel-wise predictions. We show how to apply this method to multi-person pose estimation and report state-of-the-art performance on the MPII and MS-COCO datasets.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Tsinghua University", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alejandro Newell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Newell:Alejandro", "Zhiao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zhiao", "Jia Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Jia"], "pages": 11}
