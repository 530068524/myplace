While several methods have been proposed to accomplish this task, their relative merits and limitations remain somewhat obscure. By analyzing a number of concrete examples, we show that low-complexity algorithms systematically fail when the Markov random field develops long-range correlations. More precisely, this phenomenon appears to be related to the Ising model phase transition (although it does not coincide with it).", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Andrea Montanari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montanari:Andrea", "Jose Ayres Pereira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pereira:Jose_Ayres"], "pages": 9}
