With the prevalence of wireless communication, wireless video cameras continue to replace their wired counterparts in security/surveillance systems and tactical networks. However, wirelessly streamed videos usually suffer from blocking and blurring due to inevitable packet loss in wireless transmissions. The existing source identification methods experience significant performance degradation or even fail to work when identifying videos with blocking and blurring. In this paper, we propose a method which is effective and efficient in identifying such wirelessly streamed videos. In addition, we also propose to incorporate wireless channel signatures and selective frame processing into source identification, which significantly improve the identification speed.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of Michigan", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Shaxun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shaxun", "Amit Pande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pande:Amit", "Kai Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng_0001:Kai", "Prasant Mohapatra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohapatra:Prasant"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
