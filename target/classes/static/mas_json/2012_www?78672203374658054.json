{"title": "Multi-objective ranking of comments on web.", "fields": ["ranking", "ranking svm", "satisfiability", "active learning"], "abstract": "With the explosion of information on any topic, the need for ranking is becoming very critical. Ranking typically depends on several aspects. Products, for example, have several aspects like price, recency, rating, etc. Product ranking has to bring the \"best\" product which is recent and highly rated. Hence ranking has to satisfy multiple objectives. In this paper, we explore multi-objective ranking of comments using Hodge decomposition. While Hodge decomposition produces a globally consistent ranking, a globally inconsistent component is also present. We propose an active learning strategy for the reduction of this component. Finally, we develop techniques for online Hodge decomposition. We experimentally validate the ideas presented in this paper.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "American Express", "Komli Media, Bangalore, India"], "authors": ["Onkar Dalal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dalal:Onkar", "Srinivasan H.
