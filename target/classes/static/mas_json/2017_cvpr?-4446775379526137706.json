{"title": "Learning a Deep Embedding Model for Zero-Shot Learning.", "fields": ["sentence", "visual space", "closed captioning", "embedding", "modalities"], "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) models rely on learning a joint embedding space where both textual/semantic description of object classes and visual representation of object images can be projected to for nearest neighbour search. Despite the success of deep neural networks that learn an end-to-end model between text and images in other vision problems such as image captioning, very few deep ZSL model exists and they show little advantage over ZSL models that utilise deep feature representations but do not learn an end-to-end embedding. In this paper we argue that the key to make deep ZSL models succeed is to choose the right embedding space. Instead of embedding into a semantic space or an intermediate space, we propose to use the visual space as the embedding space. This is because that in this space, the subsequent nearest neighbour search would suffer much less from the hubness problem and thus become more effective. This model design also provides a natural mechanism for multiple semantic modalities (e.g.,~attributes and sentence descriptions) to be fused and optimised jointly in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our model significantly outperforms the existing models.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Li Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Li", "Tao Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Tao", "Shaogang Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Shaogang"], "pages": 10}
