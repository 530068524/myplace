{"title": "Economies of scale in parallel-server systems.", "fields": ["homogeneous", "bounded function", "queue", "pareto principle", "server"], "abstract": "We consider a parallel-server system with K homogeneous servers where incoming tasks, arriving at rate \u03bb, are dispatched by n dispatchers. Servers are FCFS queues and dispatchers implement a size-based policy such that the servers are equally loaded. We compare the performance of a system with n> 1 dispatchers and of a system with a single dispatcher. Every dispatcher handles a fraction 1/n of the incoming traffic and balances the load to K/n servers. We show that the performance of a system with n dispatchers, K servers and arrival rate \u03bb coincides with that of a system with one dispatcher, K/n servers and arrival rate \u03bb/n. Therefore, the performance comparison can be interpreted as the economies of scale in a system with one dispatcher when we scale up the number of servers and the arrival rate proportionately. We consider two continuous service time distributions: uniform and Bounded Pareto that have increasing and decreasing failure rates, respectively; and a discrete distribution with two values, which is the distribution that maximizes the variance for a given mean. We show that the performance degradation is small for uniformly distributed job sizes, but that for Bounded Pareto and two points distributions it can be unbounded.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Aalto University", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Josu Doncel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doncel:Josu", "Samuli Aalto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aalto:Samuli", "Urtzi Ayesta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ayesta:Urtzi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
