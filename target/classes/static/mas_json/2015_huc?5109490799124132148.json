In this paper, we leverage the spatial and temporal correlation among the data sensed in different sub-areas to significantly reduce the required number of sensing tasks allocated (corresponding to budget), yet ensuring the data quality. Specifically, we propose a novel framework called  CCS-TA , combining the state-of-the-art compressive sensing, Bayesian inference, and active learning techniques, to dynamically select a minimum number of sub-areas for sensing task allocation in each sensing cycle, while deducing the missing data of unallocated sub-areas under a probabilistic data accuracy guarantee. Evaluations on real-life temperature and air quality monitoring datasets show the effectiveness of CCS-TA. In the case of temperature monitoring, CCS-TA allocates 18.0-26.5% fewer tasks than baseline approaches, allocating tasks to only 15.5% of the sub-areas on average while keeping overall sensing error below 0.25\u00b0C in 95% of the cycles.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "Peking University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Chongqing University", "Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com"], "authors": ["Leye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Leye", "Daqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Daqing", "Animesh Pathak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pathak:Animesh", "Chao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0004:Chao", "Haoyi Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Haoyi", "Dingqi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Dingqi", "Yasha Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yasha"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
