{"title": "Strategic Behaviour When Allocating Indivisible Goods.", "fields": ["fair division", "welfare economics", "probabilistic logic", "nash equilibrium", "resource allocation"], "abstract": "We survey some recent research regarding strategic behaviour in resource allocation problems, focusing on the fair division of indivisible goods. We consider a number of computational questions like how a single strategic agent misreports their preferences to ensure a particular outcome, and how agents compute a Nash equilibrium when they all act strategically. We also identify a number of future directions like dealing with non-additive utilities, and partial or probabilistic information about the preferences of other agents.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["NICTA"], "authors": ["Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
