As developers write client programs, their understanding and usage of APIs change over time. Can we learn from long-term changes in how developers work with APIs in the lifetime of a client program? We propose Temporal API Usage Mining to detect significant changes in API usage. We describe a framework to extract detailed models representing addition and removal of calls to API methods over the change history of a client program. We apply machine learning technique to these models to semi-automatically infer temporal API usage patterns, i.e., coherent addition of API calls at different phases in the life-cycle of the client program.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Gias Uddin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uddin:Gias", "Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Dagenais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dagenais:Barth=eacute=l=eacute=my", "Martin P.
