One approach to deal with this situation is consistent query answering, where queries are answered over all possible repairs of the database. In general, the repair may be very distant from the original database. In this work we present a new approach where this distance is bounded and analyze its computational complexity. Our results show that in many (but not all) cases the complexity drops.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Andreas Pfandler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfandler:Andreas", "Emanuel Sallinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sallinger:Emanuel"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
