Assuming data about the predictor, target, and membership in the protected group are available, we show how to optimally adjust any learned predictor so as to remove discrimination according to our definition. Our framework also improves incentives by shifting the cost of poor classification from disadvantaged groups to the decision maker, who can respond by improving the classification accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (227)", "departments": ["Google", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Chicago"], "authors": ["Moritz Hardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardt:Moritz", "Eric Price.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Price:Eric", "Nati Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nati"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
