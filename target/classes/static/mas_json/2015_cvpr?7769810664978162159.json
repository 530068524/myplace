This impressive progress can be in part attributed to the introduction of efficient retrieval methods for those systems. While this boosts scalability, it also limits the amount of detail that the large-scale reconstruction systems are able to produce. In this paper, we propose a joint reconstruction and retrieval system that maintains the scalability of large-scale Structure-from-Motion systems while also recovering the often lost ability of reconstructing fine details of the scene. We demonstrate our proposed method on a large-scale dataset of 7.4 million images downloaded from the Internet.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Johannes L.
