{"title": "16K Cinematic VR Streaming.", "fields": ["panning", "interactivity", "immersion", "zoom", "viewport"], "abstract": "We present an end-to-end system for streaming Cinematic Virtual Reality (VR) content (also called 360 or omnidirectional content). Content is captured and ingested at a resolution of 16K at 25Hz and streamed towards untethered mobile VR devices. Besides the usual navigation interactions such as panning and tilting offered by common VR systems, we also provide a zooming interactivity. This allows the VR client to fetch high quality pixels captured at a spatial resolution of 16K that greatly increase perceived quality compared to a 4K VR streaming solution. Since current client devices are not capable of receiving and decoding a 16K video, several optimizations are provided to only stream the required pixels for the current viewport of the user, while meeting strict latency and bandwidth requirements for a qualitative VR immersive experience.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Patrice Rondao-Alface.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rondao=Alface:Patrice", "Maarten Aerts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aerts:Maarten", "Donny Tytgat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tytgat:Donny", "Sammy Lievens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lievens:Sammy", "Christoph Stevens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stevens:Christoph", "Nico Verzijp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verzijp:Nico", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Macq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Macq:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
