The method maintains a feasible solution at every step, and is guaranteed to converge. It is similar to the iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm, but applied at each step to a block of variables representing correspondences between two adjacent frames, with the optimal conditional mode being calculated exactly as the solution to a two-frame linear assignment problem. Experiments with ground-truthed trajectory data show that the method outperforms both network-flow data association and greedy recursive filtering using a constant velocity motion model.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Robert T.
