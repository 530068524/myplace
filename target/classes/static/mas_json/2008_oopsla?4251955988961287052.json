One of the languages is a class-based object-oriented one. The other three represent extensions thereof that support various approaches to modularizing crosscutting concerns. We explain informally that an operational semantics expressed in terms of the model's concepts preserves the behavior of a program written in one of the high-level languages. We hence argue our model to be semantically sound in that sense, as well as sufficiently expressive in order to correctly support features such as class-based object-oriented programming, the open-classes and pointcut-and-advice flavors of aspect-oriented programming, and dynamic layers. For the latter, being a core feature of context-oriented programming, we also provide a formal semantics.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Antwerp", "University of Antwerp", "University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam"], "authors": ["Hans Schippers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schippers:Hans", "Dirk Janssens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Janssens:Dirk", "Michael Haupt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haupt:Michael", "Robert Hirschfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirschfeld:Robert"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2008", "pages": 18}
