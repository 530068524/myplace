Numerous learning based online channel sensing and accessing strategies have been proposed to address such challenge. In this work, we propose a novel channel sensing and accessing strategy that carefully balances the channel statistics exploration and multichannel diversity exploitation. Unlike traditional MAB-based approaches, in our scheme, a secondary cognitive radio user will sequentially sense the status of multiple channels in a carefully designed ordering. We formulate the online sequential channel sensing and accessing problem as a sequencing multi-armed bandit problem, and propose a novel policy whose regret is in optimal logarithmic rate in time and polynomial in the number of channels. We conducted extensive simulations to compare the performance of our method with traditional MAB-based approach. Our simulation results show that our scheme improves the throughput by more than 30% and speed up the learning process by more than 100%.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Institute of Co ... , PLAUST, China", "Institute of Co ... , PLAUST, China"], "authors": ["Bowen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Bowen", "Panlong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Panlong", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Shaojie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shaojie", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao", "Qihui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Qihui"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
