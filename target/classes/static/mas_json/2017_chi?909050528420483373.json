We describe the first experiment to investigate whether temperature can augment emotion conveyed by text messages. A challenge in prior work has been ensuring users can discern different thermal signals. We present an improved technique for thermal feedback that uses an array of three thermal stimulators. We demonstrate that the Thermal Array Display (TAD) increases users' ability to identify temperatures within a narrower range, compared to using a single thermal stimulator. While text messages dominate valence in the absence of context for temperature, the TAD consistently conveys arousal, and can enhance arousal of text messages, especially those that are emotionally neutral. We discuss potential applications of augmenting text with temperature.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["City University London", "City University London", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jordan Tewell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tewell:Jordan", "Jon Bird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bird:Jon", "George R.
