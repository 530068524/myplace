However, program analysis support for build code is still limited, especially for build code written in a dynamic language such as Make. We introduce SYMake, a novel program analysis and refactoring tool for build code in Makefiles. SYMake is capable of detecting several types of code smells and errors such as cyclic dependencies, rule inclusion, duplicate prerequisites, recursive variable loops, etc. It also supports automatic build code refactoring, e.g. rule extraction/removal, target creation, target/variable renaming, prerequisite extraction, etc. In addition, SYMake provides the analysis on defined rules, targets, prerequisites, and associated information to help developers better understand build code in a Makefile and its included files.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Ahmed Tamrawi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamrawi:Ahmed", "Hoan Anh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hoan_Anh", "Hung Viet Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hung_Viet", "Tien N.
