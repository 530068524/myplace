We propose a convnet based person recognition system on which we provide an in-depth analysis of informativeness of different body cues, impact of training data, and the common failure modes of the system. In addition, we discuss the limitations of existing benchmarks and propose more challenging ones. Our method is simple and is built on open source and open data, yet it improves the state of the art results on a large dataset of social media photos (PIPA).", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Seong Joon Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Seong_Joon", "Rodrigo Benenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benenson:Rodrigo", "Mario Fritz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fritz:Mario", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "pages": 9}
