{"title": "Recsplorer: recommendation algorithms based on precedence mining.", "fields": ["database", "exploit", "convex optimization", "algorithm", "data mining"], "abstract": "We study recommendations in applications where there are temporal patterns in the way items are consumed or watched. For example, a student who has taken the Advanced Algorithms course is more likely to be interested in Convex Optimization, but a student who has taken Convex Optimization need not be interested in Advanced Algorithms in the future. Similarly, a person who has purchased the Godfather I DVD on Amazon is more likely to purchase Godfather II sometime in the future (though it is not strictly necessary to watch/purchase Godfather I beforehand). We propose a  precedence mining  model that estimates the probability of future consumption based on past behavior. We then propose Recsplorer: a suite of recommendation algorithms that exploit the precedence information. We evaluate our algorithms, as well as traditional recommendation ones, using a real course planning system. We use existing transcripts to evaluate how well the algorithms perform. In addition, we augment our experiments with a user study on the live system where users rate their recommendations.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Stanford University", "IBM", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Aditya G.
