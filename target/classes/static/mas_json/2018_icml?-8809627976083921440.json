{"title": "Kernel Recursive ABC: Point Estimation with Intractable Likelihood.", "fields": ["statistical model", "recursion", "herding", "point estimation", "kernel"], "abstract": "We propose a novel approach to parameter estimation for simulator-based statistical models with intractable likelihoods. The proposed method is recursive application of kernel ABC and kernel herding to the same observed data. We provide a theoretical explanation regarding why this approach works, showing (for the population setting) that the point estimate obtained with this method converges to the true parameter as recursion proceeds, under a certain assumption. We conduct a variety of numerical experiments, including parameter estimation for a real-world pedestrian flow simulator, and show that our method outperforms existing approaches in most cases.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["NEC", "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "Max Planck Society", "Institute of St ... cal Mathematics"], "authors": ["Takafumi Kajihara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kajihara:Takafumi", "Motonobu Kanagawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanagawa:Motonobu", "Keisuke Yamazaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamazaki:Keisuke", "Kenji Fukumizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukumizu:Kenji"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
