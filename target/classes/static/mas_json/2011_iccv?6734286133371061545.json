The main vulnerability of these models resides in the need of large manually annotated training sets for the parameter estimation procedure. The issue is that these training sets need to be annotated by clinicians, which makes this training set acquisition process quite expensive. Therefore, reducing the dependence on large training sets is important for a more extensive exploration of statistical models in the LV segmentation problem. In this paper, we present a novel incremental on-line semi-supervised learning model that reduces the need of large training sets for estimating the parameters of statistical models. Compared to other semi-supervised techniques, our method yields an on-line incremental re-training and segmentation instead of the off-line incremental re-training and segmentation more commonly found in the literature. Another innovation of our approach is that we use a statistical model based on deep learning architectures, which are easily adapted to this on-line incremental learning framework. We show that our fully automatic LV segmentation method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with training sets containing less than twenty annotated images.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Gustavo Carneiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carneiro:Gustavo", "Jacinto C.
