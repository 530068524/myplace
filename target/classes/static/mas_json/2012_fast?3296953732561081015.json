{"title": "BlueSky: a cloud-backed file system for the enterprise.", "fields": ["operating system", "cloud computing", "file system", "network file system", "cloud storage"], "abstract": "We present BlueSky, a network file system backed by cloud storage. BlueSky stores data persistently in a cloud storage provider such as Amazon S3 or Windows Azure, allowing users to take advantage of the reliability and large storage capacity of cloud providers and avoid the need for dedicated server hardware. Clients access the storage through a proxy running on-site, which caches data to provide lower-latency responses and additional opportunities for optimization. We describe some of the optimizations which are necessary to achieve good performance and low cost, including a log-structured design and a secure in-cloud log cleaner. BlueSky supports multiple protocols--both NFS and CIFS--and is portable to different providers.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Michael Vrable.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vrable:Michael", "Stefan Savage.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savage:Stefan", "Geoffrey M.
