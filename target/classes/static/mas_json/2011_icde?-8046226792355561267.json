Recent advances in technologies have made it possible to deploy smart sensor networks in large water distribution networks to monitor and identify the water quality online. In such a large-scale real-time monitoring application, large amounts of data stream out of multiple concurrent sensors continuously. In this paper, we present a system to monitor and analyze the sensor data streams online, find and summarize the spatio-temporal distribution patterns and correlations in co-evolving data, detect contamination events rapidly and facilitate corrective actions or notification. The system consists of an online data mining engine and a GUI providing the user with the current patterns discovered in the network, and an alerter notifying the user if there is anomalous water quality in the network.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Xiuli Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiuli", "Hongmei Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Hongmei", "Shuiyuan Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Shuiyuan", "Qiong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qiong", "Qiong Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo_0001:Qiong", "Chunhua Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Chunhua"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
