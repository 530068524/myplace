In this paper, we propose an online Bayesian multi-view learning algorithm to learn predictive subspace with max-margin principle. Specifically, we first define the latent margin loss for classification in the subspace, and then cast the learning problem into a variational Bayesian framework by exploiting the pseudo-likelihood and data augmentation idea. With the variational approximate posterior inferred from the past samples, we can naturally combine historical knowledge with new arrival data, in a Bayesian Passive-Aggressive style. Experiments on various classification tasks show that our model have superior performance.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jia He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Jia", "Changying Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Changying", "Fuzhen Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Fuzhen", "Xin Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Xin", "Qing He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Qing", "Guoping Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Guoping"], "pages": 7}
