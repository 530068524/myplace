{"title": "\"They basically like destroyed the school one day\": On Newer App Features and Cyberbullying in Schools.", "fields": ["hyperlocal", "focus group", "anonymity", "social phenomenon", "ephemerality"], "abstract": "This exploratory work studies the effects of emerging app features on the cyberbullying practices in high school settings. These include the increasing prevalence of image/video content, perceived ephemerality, anonymity, and hyperlocal communication. Based on qualitative analysis of focus groups and follow-up individual interviews with high school students, these features were found to influence the practice of cyberbullying, as well as creating negative socio-psychological effects. For example, visual data was found to be used in cyberbullying settings as evidence of contentious events, a repeated reminder, and caused a graphic impact on recipients. Similarly, perceived ephemerality of content was found to be associated with \"broken expectations\" with respect to the apps and severe bullying outcomes for those affected. Results shed light on an important technology-mediated social phenomenon of cyberbullying, improve understanding of app use (and abuse) by the teenage user population, and pave the way for future research on countering appcentric cyberbullying.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Vivek K.
