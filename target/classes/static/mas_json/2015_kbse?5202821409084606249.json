{"title": "Semantic Slicing of Software Version Histories (T).", "fields": ["software regression", "package development process", "verification and validation", "software framework", "backporting"], "abstract": "Software developers often need to transfer func-tionality, e.g., a set of commits implementing a new feature or a bug fix, from one branch of a configuration management system to another. That can be a challenging task as the existing configuration management tools lack support for matching high-level semantic functionality with low-level version histories. The developer thus has to either manually identify the exact set of semantically-related commits implementing the functionality of interest or sequentially port a specific subset of the change history, \"inheriting\" additional, unwanted functionality. In this paper, we tackle this problem by providing automated support for identifying the set of semantically-related commits implementing a particular functionality, which is defined by a set of tests. We refer to our approach, CSLICER, as semantic slicing of version histories. We formally define the semantic slicing problem, provide an algorithm for identifying a set of commits that constitute a slice, and instantiate it in a specific implementation for Java projects managed in Git. We evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of our approach on a set of open-source software repositories. We show that it allows to identify subsets of change histories that maintain the functionality of interest but are substantially smaller than the original ones.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Yi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0008:Yi", "Julia Rubin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubin:Julia", "Marsha Chechik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechik:Marsha"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
