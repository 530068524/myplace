{"title": "The impact of memory subsystem resource sharing on datacenter applications.", "fields": ["image stitching", "cache", "multi core processor", "web search engine", "thread"], "abstract": "In this paper we study the impact of sharing memory resources on five Google datacenter applications:  a web search engine, bigtable, content analyzer, image stitching , and  protocol buffer . While prior work has found neither positive nor negative effects from cache sharing across the PARSEC benchmark suite, we find that across these datacenter applications, there is both a sizable benefit and a potential degradation from improperly sharing resources. There are four main contributions of this paper. First, we present a study of the importance of thread-to-core mapping for applications in the datacenter as threads can be mapped to share or to not share caches and bus bandwidth. Second, we investigate the impact of co-locating threads from multiple applications with diverse memory behavior and discover that the best mapping for a given application changes de- pending on its co-runner. Third, we investigate the application characteristics that impact performance in the various thread-to-core mapping scenarios. Finally, we present both a heuristics-based and an adaptive approach to arrive at good thread-to-core decisions in the datacenter. We observe performance swings of up to 25% for web search, and 40% for other key applications, simply based on how application threads are mapped to cores. By employing our adaptive thread to core mapper the performance of the datacenter applications presented in this work improved by up to 22% over status quo thread-to-core mapping and performs within 3% of optimal.", "citation": "Citations (208)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "Google", "University of Virginia", "Pure Storage, M ... n View, CA, USA"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Lingjia Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Lingjia", "Jason Mars.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mars:Jason", "Neil Vachharajani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vachharajani:Neil", "Robert Hundt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hundt:Robert", "Mary Lou Soffa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soffa:Mary_Lou"], "pages": 12}
