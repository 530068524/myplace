{"title": "Design and analysis of a choking strategy for coalitions in data swarming systems.", "fields": ["swarm behaviour", "simple random sample", "upload", "choking", "bittorrent"], "abstract": "We design and analyze a mechanism for forming coalitions of peers in a data swarming system where peers have heterogeneous upload capacities. A coalition is a set of peers that explicitly cooperate with other peers inside the coalition via choking, data replication, and capacity allocation strategies. Further, each peer interacts with other peers outside its coalition via potentially distinct choking, data replication, and capacity allocation strategies. Following on our preliminary work in [14] that demonstrated significant performance benefits of coalitions, we present here a comprehensive analysis of the choking strategy for coalitions. We first develop an analytical model to understand a simple random choking strategy as a within-coalition strategy and show that it accurately predicts a coalition's performance. Our model shows that the random choking strategy can help a coalition achieve near-optimal performance by optimally choosing the re-choking interval lengths and the number of unchoke slots. Further, our analytical model can be easily adapted to model a BitTorrent-like swarm. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate improvements in the performance of a swarming system due to coalition formation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Suffolk University", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Honggang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Honggang", "Sudarshan Vasudevan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasudevan:Sudarshan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
