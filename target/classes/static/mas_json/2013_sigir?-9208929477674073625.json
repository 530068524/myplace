While topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have a long history of successful application to news articles and academic abstracts, they are often less coherent when applied to microblog content like Twitter. In this paper, we investigate methods to improve topics learned from Twitter content without modifying the basic machinery of LDA; we achieve this through various pooling schemes that aggregate tweets in a data preprocessing step for LDA. We empirically establish that a novel method of tweet pooling by hashtags leads to a vast improvement in a variety of measures for topic coherence across three diverse Twitter datasets in comparison to an unmodified LDA baseline and a variety of pooling schemes. An additional contribution of automatic hashtag labeling further improves on the hashtag pooling results for a subset of metrics. Overall, these two novel schemes lead to significantly improved LDA topic models on Twitter content.", "citation": "Citations (234)", "departments": ["Birla Institute of Technology and Science", "NICTA", "NICTA", "NICTA"], "authors": ["Rishabh Mehrotra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehrotra:Rishabh", "Scott Sanner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanner:Scott", "Wray L.
