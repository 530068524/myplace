Typically their effectiveness is measured either in  L  1  or  L  2  error. In this paper we investigate the challenges in using  L  \u221e  (or worst case) error, a stronger measure than  L  1  or  L  2 . We present efficient solutions to two linked challenges: how to evaluate the  L  \u221e  error between two kernel density estimates and how to choose the bandwidth parameter for a kernel density estimate built on a subsample of a large data set.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "authors": ["Yan Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yan", "Jeff M.
