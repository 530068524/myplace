{"title": "Speeding up Magnetic Resonance Image Acquisition by Bayesian Multi-Slice Adaptive Compressed Sensing.", "fields": ["inference", "factorization", "linear dynamical system", "compressed sensing", "covariance"], "abstract": "We show how to sequentially optimize magnetic resonance imaging measurement designs over stacks of neighbouring image slices, by performing convex variational inference on a large scale non-Gaussian linear dynamical system, tracking dominating directions of posterior covariance without imposing any factorization constraints. Our approach can be scaled up to high-resolution images by reductions to numerical mathematics primitives and parallelization on several levels. In a first study, designs are found that improve significantly on others chosen independently for each slice or drawn at random.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Max Planck Society"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Matthias W.
