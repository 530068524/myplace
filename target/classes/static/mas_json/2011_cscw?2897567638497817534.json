{"title": "Supporting generation Y interactions: challenges for office work.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "workforce", "computer science"], "abstract": "With Generation Y entering the workforce, for the first time IT supported tools at home are more advanced than these tools at work. This project aims to understand and model this friction and its challenges through a sequence of literature review and interviews. We identified six qualities of interactions and how they occur in private and work contexts. Based on these findings, we aim to develop guidelines as well as demonstrators that support Generation Y interactions in future office work.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Exact, Delft, Netherlands"], "authors": ["Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0020:Wei", "Pieter Jan Stappers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stappers:Pieter_Jan", "Gert Pasman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasman:Gert", "Jenneke Taal-Fokker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taal=Fokker:Jenneke"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
