{"title": "Bridging Languages through Etymology: The case of cross language text categorization.", "fields": ["jump", "bridging", "categorization", "test data", "etymology"], "abstract": "We propose the hypothesis that word etymology is useful for NLP applications as a bridge between languages. We support this hypothesis with experiments in crosslanguage (English-Italian) document categorization. In a straightforward bag-ofwords experimental set-up we add etymological ancestors of the words in the documents, and investigate the performance of a model built on English data, on Italian test data (and viceversa). The results show not only statistically significant, but a large improvement \u2010 a jump of almost 40 points in F1-score \u2010 over the raw (vanilla bag-ofwords) representation.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "fondazione bruno kessler"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Vivi Nastase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nastase:Vivi", "Carlo Strapparava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strapparava:Carlo"], "pages": 9}
