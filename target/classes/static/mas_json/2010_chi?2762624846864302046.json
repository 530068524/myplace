The nature of sedentary activity is self-reinforcing, such that increasing physical and decreasing sedentary activity is difficult. We present a novel approach aimed at combating this problem in the context of computer games. Rather than explicitly changing the amount of physical and sedentary activity a person sets out to perform, we propose a new game design that leverages user engagement to generate out of game motivation to perform physical activity while playing. In our design, players gain virtual game rewards in return for real physical activity performed. Here we present and evaluate an application of our design to the game Neverball. We adapted Neverball by reducing the time allocated to accomplish the game tasks and motivated players to perform physical activity by offering time based rewards. An empirical evaluation involving 180 participants shows that the participants performed more physical activity, decreased the amount of sedentary playing time, and did not report a decrease in perceived enjoyment of playing the activity motivating version of Neverball.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["Hobart Corporation", "Hobart Corporation", "Hobart Corporation", "Hobart Corporation", "Hobart Corporation"], "authors": ["Shlomo Berkovsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berkovsky:Shlomo", "Mac Coombe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coombe:Mac", "Jill Freyne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freyne:Jill", "Dipak Bhandari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhandari:Dipak", "Nilufar Baghaei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baghaei:Nilufar"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
