{"title": "Classical Scaling Revisited.", "fields": ["embedding", "metric", "smoothness", "norm", "solver"], "abstract": "Multidimensional-scaling (MDS) is an information analysis tool. It involves the evaluation of distances between data points, which is a quadratic space-time problem. Then, MDS procedures find an embedding of the points in a low dimensional Euclidean (flat) domain, optimizing for the similarity of inter-points distances. We present an efficient solver for Classical Scaling (a specific MDS model) by extending the distances measured from a subset of the points to the rest, while exploiting the smoothness property of the distance functions. The smoothness is measured by the L2 norm of the Laplace-Beltrami operator applied to the unknown distance function. The Laplace Beltrami reflects the local differential relations between points, and can be computed in linear time. Classical-scaling is thereby reformulated into a quasi-linear space-time complexities procedure.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Gil Shamai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamai:Gil", "Yonathan Aflalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aflalo:Yonathan", "Michael Zibulevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zibulevsky:Michael", "Ron Kimmel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimmel:Ron"], "pages": 9}
