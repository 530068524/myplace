Since many applications written in modern programming languages, such as C++ and Java, use containers as standard building blocks, precise analysis of many programs requires a fairly sophisticated understanding of container contents. In this paper, we present a sound, precise, and fully automatic technique for static reasoning about contents of containers. We show that the proposed technique adds useful precision for verifying real C++ applications and that it scales to applications with over 100,000 lines of code.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Isil Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Isil", "Thomas Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Thomas", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2011", "pages": 14}
