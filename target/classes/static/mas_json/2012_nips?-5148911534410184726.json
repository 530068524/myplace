Diversity is useful for several reasons such as interpretability, robustness to noise, etc. We propose several spectral regularizers that capture a notion of diversity of features and show that these are all submodular set functions. These regularizers, when added to the objective function for linear regression, result in approximately submodular functions, which can then be maximized by efficient greedy and local search algorithms, with provable guarantees. We compare our algorithms to traditional greedy and l1-regularization schemes and show that we obtain a more diverse set of features that result in the regression problem being stable under perturbations.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Yahoo!", "Google"], "authors": ["Abhimanyu Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Abhimanyu", "Anirban Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta_0001:Anirban", "Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Ravi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
