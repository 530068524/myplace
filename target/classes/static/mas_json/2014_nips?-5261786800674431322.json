{"title": "Iterative Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator NADE-k.", "fields": ["inference engine", "subset and superset", "estimator", "density estimation", "deep learning"], "abstract": "Training of the neural autoregressive density estimator (NADE) can be viewed as doing one step of probabilistic inference on missing values in data. We propose a new model that extends this inference scheme to multiple steps, arguing that it is easier to learn to improve a reconstruction in k steps rather than to learn to reconstruct in a single inference step. The proposed model is an unsupervised building block for deep learning that combines the desirable properties of NADE and multi-prediction training: (1) Its test likelihood can be computed analytically, (2) it is easy to generate independent samples from it, and (3) it uses an inference engine that is a superset of variational inference for Boltzmann machines. The proposed NADE-k is competitive with the state-of-the-art in density estimation on the two datasets tested.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tapani Raiko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raiko:Tapani", "Li Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Li", "KyungHyun Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:KyungHyun", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua"], "pages": 9}
