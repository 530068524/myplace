However, these reports widely differ in their quality. We conducted a survey among developers and users of APACHE, ECLIPSE, and MOZILLA to find out what makes a good bug report.   The analysis of the 466 responses revealed an information mismatch between what developers need and what users supply. Most developers consider steps to reproduce, stack traces, and test cases as helpful, which are at the same time most difficult to provide for users. Such insight is helpful to design new bug tracking tools that guide users at collecting and providing more helpful information.   Our CUEZILLA prototype is such a tool and measures the quality of new bug reports; it also recommends which elements should be added to improve the quality. We trained CUEZILLA on a sample of 289 bug reports, rated by developers as part of the survey. In our experiments, CUEZILLA was able to predict the quality of 31--48% of bug reports accurately.", "citation": "Citations (498)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "University of Victoria", "University of Zurich", "Saarland University", "Microsoft", "University of Amsterdam", "Queen's University", "Saarland University", "University of Victoria"], "authors": ["Nicolas Bettenburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bettenburg:Nicolas", "Sascha Just.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Just:Sascha", "Adrian Schr\u00f6ter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schr=ouml=ter:Adrian", "Cathrin Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:Cathrin", "Rahul Premraj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Premraj:Rahul", "Thomas Zimmermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmermann_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2008", "pages": 11}
