While various simulation studies for a number of NLP tasks have shown that AL works well on goldstandard data, there is some doubt whether the approach can be successful when applied to noisy, real-world data sets. This paper presents a thorough evaluation of the impact of annotation noise on AL and shows that systematic noise resulting from biased coder decisions can seriously harm the AL process. We present a method to filter out inconsistent annotations during AL and show that this makes AL far more robust when applied to noisy data.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ines Rehbein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rehbein:Ines", "Josef Ruppenhofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruppenhofer:Josef"], "pages": 9}
