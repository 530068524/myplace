{"title": "A framework to evaluate software engineering student contests: evaluation and integration with academic programs.", "fields": ["best practice", "engineering management", "curriculum", "further education", "software engineering"], "abstract": "There are hundreds of general contests targeting undergraduate and graduate students. The prizes vary from cash, trip, fame, conference participation and others. Contests could be class competitions, school, national, regional or global. In this paper, we compare between existing student contests that can be integrated with software engineering courses. We classify the contests and propose a framework to choose which one to suit curriculum. We also include best practices and samples of our practices in integrating software engineering course with class, regional, national and global contests.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["American University of Kuwait"], "authors": ["Amir Zeid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeid:Amir"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 7}
