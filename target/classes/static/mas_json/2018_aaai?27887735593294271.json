To alleviate typical optimization challenges in latent-variable models for text, we employ deconvolutional networks as the sequence decoder (generator), providing learned latent codes with more semantic information and better generalization. Our model, trained in an unsupervised manner, yields stronger empirical predictive performance than a decoder based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), with less parameters and considerably faster training. Further, we apply it to text sequence-matching problems. The proposed model significantly outperforms several strong sentence-encoding baselines, especially in the semi-supervised setting.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Dinghan Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Dinghan", "Yizhe Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yizhe", "Ricardo Henao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henao:Ricardo", "Qinliang Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Qinliang", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
