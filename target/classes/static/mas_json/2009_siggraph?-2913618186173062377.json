The AR technology uses the existing real environment and overlays a new digital information on top of it. There are many AR application developed in many aspects of life e.g. health, education, military, industry, entertainment, etc. This research explores the location-based AR technology to develop a game named Monster Buster. This game is an Android platform. This game uses the information of latitude and longitude used to generate the position of the monster. This research is expected to develop an innovative game application that can give another user's experience by using the location-based AR technology. The Unity 3D is the game engine that is used in this research, and the Kudan SDK is used to provide the AR technology.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Nagaoka Institute of Design", "Nagaoka Institute of Design", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "Nagaoka Institute of Design", "Nagaoka Institute of Design", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tokyo", "Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology", "Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology", "Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology", "Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology", "Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology", "Nanjing University", "Peking University", "Jadavpur University", "Jadavpur University", "Jadavpur University", "University of Edinburgh", "Japan Cultural  ... age Consultancy"], "authors": ["Taku Kimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimura:Taku"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
