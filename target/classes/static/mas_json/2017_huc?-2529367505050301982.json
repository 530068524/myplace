A shopper's smartwatch emits sound every time the shopper picks up or touches an item inside a store. This sound is then localized, in 2D space, by calculating the angles of arrival captured by multiple microphones deployed on the racks. Lastly, the 2D location is mapped to specific items on the rack based on the rack layout information. In our initial experiments conducted with a single rack with 16 compartments, we could localize the shopper's smartwatch with a median estimation error of 15.9 cm in 2-dimensional space.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University"], "authors": ["Amit Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Amit", "Youngki Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Youngki"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
