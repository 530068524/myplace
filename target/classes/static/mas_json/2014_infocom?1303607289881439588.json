In this paper, we address an even more complex scenario: an LTE-based, 2-tier heterogeneous network where D2D mode is supported under the network control. All communications (macrocell, microcell and D2D-based) share the same frequency bands, hence they may interfere. We then determine (i) the network node that should serve each user and (ii) the radio resources to be scheduled for such communication. To this end, we develop an accurate model of the system and apply approximate dynamic programming to solve it. Our algorithms allow us to deal with realistic, large-scale scenarios. In such scenarios, we compare our approach to today's networks where eICIC techniques and proportional fairness scheduling are implemented. Results highlight that our solution increases the system throughput while greatly reducing energy consumption. We also show that D2D mode can effectively support content delivery without significantly harming macrocells or microcells traffic, leading to an increased system capacity. Interestingly, we find that D2D mode can be a low-cost alternative to microcells.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Politec. di Tor ... o, Turin, Italy", "Politec. di Tor ... o, Turin, Italy", "Politec. di Tor ... o, Turin, Italy", "Politec. di Tor ... o, Turin, Italy"], "authors": ["Francesco Malandrino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malandrino:Francesco", "Claudio Casetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casetti:Claudio", "Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiasserini:Carla=Fabiana", "Zana Limani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Limani:Zana"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
