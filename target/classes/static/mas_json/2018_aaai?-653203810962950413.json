Conventional approaches for modeling skeletons usually rely on hand-crafted parts or traversal rules, thus resulting in limited expressive power and difficulties of generalization. In this work, we propose a novel model of dynamic skeletons called Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN), which moves beyond the limitations of previous methods by automatically learning both the spatial and temporal patterns from data. This formulation not only leads to greater expressive power but also stronger generalization capability. On two large datasets, Kinetics and NTU-RGBD, it achieves substantial improvements over mainstream methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Amazon.com", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Sijie Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Sijie", "Yuanjun Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Yuanjun", "Dahua Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Dahua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
