The system is intrinsically affected by outage events. Resource allocation algorithms based on Bayesian games are proposed. The existence, uniqueness, and some stability properties of Nash equilibriums (NE) are analyzed. For some asymptotic setting, closed form expressions of NEs are also provided.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Institut Eur\u00e9com", "Institut Eur\u00e9com", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Xiao Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Xiao", "Laura Cottatellucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cottatellucci:Laura", "Konstantin Avrachenkov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avrachenkov:Konstantin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
