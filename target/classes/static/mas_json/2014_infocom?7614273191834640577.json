The hybrid underlying network is composed of large numbers of mobile users and a small portion of Access Points (APs). Because APs can facilitate the communication among long-distance nodes, the concept of physical proximity community can be extended to be one across the geographical space. In this work, we first investigate a space-crossing community detection method for MSNs. Based on the detection results, we design a novel data forwarding algorithm SAAS (Social Attraction and AP Spreading), and show how to exploit the space-crossing communities to improve the data forwarding efficiency. We evaluate our SAAS algorithm on real-life data from MIT Reality Mining and University of Illinois Movement (UIM). Results show that space-crossing community plays a positive role in data forwarding in MSNs in terms of delivery ratio and delay. Based on this new type of community, SAAS achieves a better performance than existing social community-based data forwarding algorithms in practice, including Bubble Rap and Nguyen's Routing algorithms. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Tongji University", "Tongji University", "Tongji University", "Tongji University", "University of Ottawa"], "authors": ["Zhong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhong", "Cheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Cheng", "Siqian Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Siqian", "Changjun Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Changjun", "Ivan Stojmenovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stojmenovic:Ivan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
