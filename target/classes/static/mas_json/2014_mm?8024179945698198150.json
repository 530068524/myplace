{"title": "The Yael Library.", "fields": ["python", "search engine indexing", "k nearest neighbors algorithm", "image retrieval", "matlab"], "abstract": "This paper introduces Yael, a library implementing computationally intensive functions used in large scale image retrieval, such as neighbor search, clustering and inverted files. The library offers interfaces for C, Python and Matlab. Along with a brief tutorial, we analyze and discuss some of our implementation choices, and their impact on efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Matthijs Douze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Douze:Matthijs", "Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=eacute=gou:Herv=eacute="], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
