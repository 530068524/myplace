Mapping these phenotypes to pairs of genetic loci is hindered by the huge number of candidates leading to enormous computational and statistical problems. In GWAS on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one has to consider in the order of 10 10  to 10 14  pairs, which is infeasible in practice. In this article, we give the first algorithm for 2-locus genome-wide association studies that is subquadratic in the number,  n , of SNPs. The running time of our algorithm is data-dependent, but large experiments over real genomic data suggest that it scales empirically as n 3/2 . As a result, our algorithm can easily cope with  n  ~ 10 7 , i.e., it can efficiently search all pairs of SNPs in the human genome.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Crete", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Panagiotis Achlioptas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achlioptas:Panagiotis", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard", "Karsten M.
