{"title": "A Multi-step Inertial Forward-Backward Splitting Method for Non-convex Optimization.", "fields": ["inertial frame of reference", "lipschitz continuity", "convex function", "submanifold", "differentiable function"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a multi-step inertial Forward--Backward splitting algorithm for minimizing the sum of two non-necessarily convex functions, one of which is proper lower semi-continuous while the other is differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous gradient. We first prove global convergence of the scheme with the help of the Kurdyka\u2013\u0141ojasiewicz property. Then, when the non-smooth part is also partly smooth relative to a smooth submanifold, we establish finite identification of the latter and provide sharp local linear convergence analysis. The proposed method is illustrated on a few problems arising from statistics and machine learning.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Caen Lower Normandy", "University of Caen Lower Normandy", "Paris Dauphine University"], "authors": ["Jingwei Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Jingwei", "Jalal Fadili.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fadili:Jalal", "Gabriel Peyr\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peyr=eacute=:Gabriel"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
