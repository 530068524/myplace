We have a powerful interplay between these disciplines - we can use geometric intuition to formulate new concepts in type theory and, conversely, use type-theoretic machinery to verify and often simplify existing mathematical proofs.   Higher inductive types form a crucial part of this new system since they allow us to represent mathematical objects, such as spheres, tori, pushouts, and quotients, in the type theory. We investigate a class of higher inductive types called W-suspensions which generalize Martin-Lof's well-founded trees. We show that a propositional variant of W-suspensions, whose computational behavior is determined up to a higher path, is characterized by the universal property of being a homotopy-initial algebra. As a corollary we get that W-suspensions in the strict form are homotopy-initial.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Kristina Sojakova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sojakova:Kristina"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
