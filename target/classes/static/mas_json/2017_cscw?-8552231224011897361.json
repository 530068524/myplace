{"title": "Using the Model of Regulation to Understand Software Development Collaboration Practices and Tool Support.", "fields": ["software development", "interview", "human computer interaction", "vocabulary", "software"], "abstract": "We developed the Model of Regulation to provide a vocabulary for comparing and analyzing collaboration practices and tools in software engineering. This paper discusses the model's ability to capture how individuals self-regulate their own tasks and activities, how they regulate one another, and how they achieve a shared understanding of project goals and tasks. Using the model, we created an \"action-oriented\" instrument that individuals, teams, and organizations can use to reflect on how they regulate their work and on the various tools they use as part of regulation. We applied this instrument to two industrial software projects, interviewing one or two stakeholders from each project. The model allowed us to identify where certain processes and communication channels worked well, while recognizing friction points, communication breakdowns, and regulation gaps. We believe this model also shows potential for application in other domains.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria"], "authors": ["Maryi Arciniegas-Mendez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arciniegas=Mendez:Maryi"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 17}
