These models are attractive because they ensure exchangeability (over samples). We propose here extensions of these models where the dependency between samples is given by a known decomposable graph. These models have appealing properties and can be easily learned using Monte Carlo techniques.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Bordeaux", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Francois Caron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caron:Francois", "Arnaud Doucet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doucet:Arnaud"], "pages": 9}
