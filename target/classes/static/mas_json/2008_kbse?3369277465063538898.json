{"title": "PtYasm: Software Model Checking with Proof Templates.", "fields": ["software development", "loop unrolling", "verification and validation", "software verification", "software construction"], "abstract": "We describe PTYASM, an enhanced version of the YASM software model checker which uses proof templates. These templates associate correctness arguments with common programming idioms, thus enabling efficient verification. We have used PTYASM to verify the safety of array accesses in programs derived from the Verisec suite. PTYASM is able to verify this property in the majority of testcases, while existing software model checkers fail to do so due to loop unrolling.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Thomas E.
