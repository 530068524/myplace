{"title": "The application of forgiveness in social system design.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "social psychology", "harm", "forgiveness", "social system"], "abstract": "When an offence occurs, the victim and offender can overcome the harm done through forgiveness. This paper demonstrates how forgiveness can be supported in social system design. We first describe what forgiveness is, how it is motivated and what benefits follow from forgiveness. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose five provisions to guide designers who want to encourage reparation in social systems.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Bath", "Google", "University of Bath"], "authors": ["Asimina Vasalou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasalou:Asimina", "Jens Riegelsberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riegelsberger:Jens", "Adam N.
