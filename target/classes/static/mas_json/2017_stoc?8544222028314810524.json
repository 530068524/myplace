We establish unconditionally that there is an infinite sequence { p   n  } of primes and a randomized algorithm  A  running in expected sub-exponential time such that for each  n , on input 1 | p   n  | ,  A  outputs  p   n   with probability 1. In other words, our result provides a pseudodeterministic construction of primes in sub-exponential time which works infinitely often.   This result follows from a more general theorem about pseudodeterministic constructions. A property  Q  \u00e2   {0,1} *  is I\ufffd-dense if for large enough  n , | Q  \u00e2 \u00a9 {0,1}  n  | \u00e2 \ufffd I\ufffd 2  n  . We show that for each  c  > 0 at least one of the following holds: (1) There is a pseudodeterministic polynomial time construction of a family { H   n  } of sets,  H   n   \u00e2   {0,1}  n  , such that for each (1/ n   c  )-dense property  Q  \u00e2    DTIME ( n   c  ) and every large enough  n ,  H   n   \u00e2 \u00a9  Q  \u00e2  \u00e2  ; or (2) There is a deterministic sub-exponential time construction of a family { H \u00e2 \ufffd  n  } of sets,  H \u00e2 \ufffd  n   \u00e2   {0,1}  n  , such that for each (1/ n   c  )-dense property  Q  \u00e2    DTIME ( n   c  ) and for infinitely many values of  n ,  H \u00e2 \ufffd  n   \u00e2 \u00a9  Q  \u00e2  \u00e2  .   We provide further algorithmic applications that might be of independent interest. Perhaps intriguingly, while our main results are unconditional, they have a non-constructive element, arising from a sequence of applications of the hardness versus randomness paradigm.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Charles University in Prague", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Igor Carboni Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveira:Igor_Carboni", "Rahul Santhanam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santhanam:Rahul"], "pages": 13}
