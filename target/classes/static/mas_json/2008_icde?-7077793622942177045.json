While annotation management systems are emerging in the field of relational data, such systems for scientific applications, where there is a wide heterogeneity in the types of annotable data, are almost nonexistent. In this demonstration paper, we describe  Graphitti , a tool that (i) allows a user to annotate a wide variety of scientific data, and (ii) allows a user to query data and their annotations in a seamless manner.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Sandeep Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Sandeep", "Christopher Condit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Condit:Christopher", "Amarnath Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Amarnath"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
