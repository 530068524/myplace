Unlike traditional message passing algorithms, which operate uniformly on the whole factor graph, our method dynamically chooses regions of the factor graph on which to focus message-passing efforts. We propose two criteria for selecting regions, including an efficiently computable upper-bound on the increase in the objective possible by passing messages in any particular region. This bound is derived from the theory of primal-dual methods from combinatorial optimization, and the forest that maximizes the bounds can be chosen efficiently using a maximum-spanning-tree-like algorithm. Experimental results show that our dynamic schedules significantly speed up state-of-the-art LP-based message-passing algorithms on a wide variety of real-world problems.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Microsoft", "University College London", "TTI Chicago"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Daniel Tarlow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarlow:Daniel", "Dhruv Batra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Batra:Dhruv", "Pushmeet Kohli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohli:Pushmeet", "Vladimir Kolmogorov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolmogorov:Vladimir"], "pages": 8}
