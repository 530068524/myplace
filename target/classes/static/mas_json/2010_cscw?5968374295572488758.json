{"title": "Catchup: a useful application of time-travel in meetings.", "fields": ["conversation", "multimedia", "teleconference", "gist", "cognition"], "abstract": "People are often required to catch up on information they have missed in meetings, because of lateness or scheduling conflicts. Catching up is a complex cognitive process where people try to understand the current conversation without access to prior discussion. We develop and evaluate a novel Catchup audio player that allows \"time-travel\". It automatically identifies the gist of what was missed, allowing people to join the meeting late and still participate effectively. In a lab study, we evaluated people's understanding of meetings they had partly missed, by asking questions about meeting content. We tested whether providing Catchup gist overcomes the potential disadvantage that people must join even later - because catching up takes time. Catchup users understood meetings 70% better than controls who simply joined late. They were more confident of their understanding and indicated a positive attitude towards the tool. We are currently exploring more general applications of the time-travel approach.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "University of Sheffield", "University of Sheffield", "University of Sheffield"], "authors": ["Simon Tucker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tucker:Simon", "Ofer Bergman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergman:Ofer", "Anand Ramamoorthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramamoorthy:Anand", "Steve Whittaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittaker:Steve"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
