The system uses a depth camera to track the pose of a user standing in front of a large display. A volume visualization of a CT dataset is augmented onto the user, creating the illusion that the user can look into his body. Using gestures, different slices from the CT and a photographic dataset can be selected for visualization. In addition, the system can show 3D models of organs, text information and images about anatomy. For interaction with this data we present a new interaction metaphor that makes use of the depth camera. The visibility of hands and body is modified based on the distance to a virtual interaction plane. This helps the user to understand the spatial relations between his body and the virtual interaction plane.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Tobias Blum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blum:Tobias", "Valerie Kleeberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kleeberger:Valerie", "Christoph Bichlmeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bichlmeier:Christoph", "Nassir Navab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navab:Nassir"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
