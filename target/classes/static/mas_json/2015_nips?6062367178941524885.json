{"title": "Online Learning with Gaussian Payoffs and Side Observations.", "fields": ["minimax", "stochastic game", "gaussian", "sequence learning", "regret"], "abstract": "We consider a sequential learning problem with Gaussian payoffs and side observations: after selecting an action i, the learner receives information about the payoff of every action j in the form of Gaussian observations whose mean is the same as the mean payoff, but the variance depends on the pair (i, j) (and may be infinite). The setup allows a more refined information transfer from one action to another than previous partial monitoring setups, including the recently introduced graph-structured feedback case. For the first time in the literature, we provide non-asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds on the regret of any algorithm, which recover existing asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds and finite-time minimax lower bounds available in the literature. We also provide algorithms that achieve the problem-dependent lower bound (up to some universal constant factor) or the minimax lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors).", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Imperial College London", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yifan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yifan", "Andr\u00e1s Gy\u00f6rgy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gy=ouml=rgy:Andr=aacute=s", "Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szepesv=aacute=ri:Csaba"], "pages": 9}
