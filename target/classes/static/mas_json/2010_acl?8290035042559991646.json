Frame-based systems currently make use of the FrameNet database but fail to show suitable generalization capabilities in out-of-domain scenarios. In this paper, a state-of-art system for frame-based SRL is extended through the encapsulation of a distributional model of semantic similarity. The resulting argument classification model promotes a simpler feature space that limits the potential overfitting effects. The large scale empirical study here discussed confirms that state-of-art accuracy can be obtained for out-of-domain evaluations.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of R ... a, Tor Vergata", "University of R ... a, Tor Vergata", "University of R ... a, Tor Vergata", "University of R ... a, Tor Vergata"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Danilo Croce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Croce:Danilo", "Cristina Giannone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giannone:Cristina", "Paolo Annesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Annesi:Paolo", "Roberto Basili.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basili_0001:Roberto"], "pages": 10}
