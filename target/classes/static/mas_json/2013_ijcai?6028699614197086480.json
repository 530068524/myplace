In this paper, we propose a new class of kernel functions, referred to as string rewriting kernel, to address the problem. A string re-writing kernel measures the similarity between two pairs of strings. It can capture the lexical and structural similarity between sentence pairs without the need of constructing syntactic trees. We further propose an instance of string re-writing kernel which can be computed efficiently. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve comparable results with state-of-the-art methods on two sentence rewriting learning tasks: paraphrase identification and recognizing textual entailment.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Huawei", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Fan Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Fan", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hang", "Xiaoyan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaoyan"], "pages": 5}
