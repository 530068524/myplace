However, there is a lack of studies that propose indicators of changes for service-oriented systems. Like any other software systems, such systems evolve to address functional and non func- tional requirements. In this research, we investigate the change- proneness of service-oriented systems from the perspective of software engineers. Based on the feedback from our industrial partners we investigate which indicators can be used to highlight change-prone application programming interfaces (APIs) and service interfaces in order to improve their reusability and response time. The output of this PhD research will assist software engineers in designing stable APIs and reusable services with adequate response time.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Daniele Romano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romano:Daniele"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
