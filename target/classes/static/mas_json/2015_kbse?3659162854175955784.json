{"title": "Cost-Efficient Sampling for Performance Prediction of Configurable Systems (T).", "fields": ["heuristic", "theoretical computer science", "performance prediction", "cost efficiency", "sampling"], "abstract": "A key challenge of the development and maintenanceof configurable systems is to predict the performance ofindividual system variants based on the features selected. It isusually infeasible to measure the performance of all possible variants, due to feature combinatorics. Previous approaches predictperformance based on small samples of measured variants, butit is still open how to dynamically determine an ideal samplethat balances prediction accuracy and measurement effort. Inthis paper, we adapt two widely-used sampling strategies forperformance prediction to the domain of configurable systemsand evaluate them in terms of sampling cost, which considersprediction accuracy and measurement effort simultaneously. Togenerate an initial sample, we introduce a new heuristic based onfeature frequencies and compare it to a traditional method basedon t-way feature coverage. We conduct experiments on six realworldsystems and provide guidelines for stakeholders to predictperformance by sampling.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Atri Sarkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkar:Atri", "Jianmei Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jianmei", "Norbert Siegmund.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siegmund:Norbert", "Sven Apel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apel:Sven", "Krzysztof Czarnecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czarnecki:Krzysztof"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
