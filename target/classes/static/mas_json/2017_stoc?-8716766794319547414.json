In this paper, we consider the problem of finding and reporting a cycle of length 2 k  in an undirected graph  G  with  n  nodes and  m  edges for constant  k \u00e2 \ufffd 2. A classic result by Bondy and Simonovits [J. Combinatorial Theory, 1974] implies that if  m  \u00e2 \ufffd 100 k   n  1+1/ k  , then  G  contains a 2 k -cycle, further implying that one needs to consider only graphs with  m  =  O ( n  1+1/ k  ).   Previously the best known algorithms were an  O ( n  2 ) algorithm due to Yuster and Zwick [J. Discrete Math 1997] as well as a  O ( m  2\u00e2  (1+\u00e2    k /2 \u00e2   \u00e2  1 )/( k +1) ) algorithm by Alon et. al. [Algorithmica 1997].   We present an algorithm that uses  O (  m  2 k /( k +1)  ) time and finds a 2 k -cycle if one exists. This bound is  O ( n  2 ) exactly when  m  = I ( n  1+1/ k  ). When finding 4-cycles our new bound coincides with Alon et. al., while for every  k >2 our new bound yields a polynomial improvement in  m .   Yuster and Zwick noted that it is \u00e2  plausible to conjecture that  O ( n  2 ) is the best possible bound in terms of  n \u00e2  . We show \u00e2  conditional optimality\u00e2  : if this hypothesis holds then our  O ( m  2 k /( k +1) ) algorithm is tight as well. Furthermore, a folklore reduction implies that no  combinatorial  algorithm can determine if a graph contains a 6-cycle in time  O ( m  3/2\u00e2  I\u00b5 ) for any I\u00b5>0 unless boolean matrix multiplication can be solved combinatorially in time  O ( n  3\u00e2  I\u00b5\u00e2 \ufffd ) for some I\u00b5\u00e2 \ufffd > 0, which is widely believed to be false. Coupled with our main result, this gives tight bounds for finding 6-cycles combinatorially and also separates the complexity of finding 4- and 6-cycles giving evidence that the exponent of  m  in the running time should indeed increase with  k .   The key ingredient in our algorithm is a new notion of  capped   k  -walks , which are walks of length  k  that visit only nodes according to a fixed ordering. Our main technical contribution is an involved analysis proving several properties of such walks which may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["S\u00f8ren Dahlgaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dahlgaard:S=oslash=ren", "Mathias B\u00e6k Tejs Knudsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knudsen:Mathias_B=aelig=k_Tejs", "Morten St\u00f6ckel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/St=ouml=ckel:Morten"], "pages": 9}
