{"title": "Arithmetic Circuits: A Chasm at Depth Four.", "fields": ["circuit complexity", "arbitrary precision arithmetic", "polynomial identity testing", "polynomial", "arithmetic circuit complexity", "exponential function", "multiplication", "saturation arithmetic", "boolean circuit"], "abstract": "We show that proving exponential lower bounds on depth four arithmetic circuits imply exponential lower bounds for unrestricted depth arithmetic circuits. In other words, for exponential sized circuits additional depth beyond four does not help. We then show that a complete black-box derandomization of identity testing problem for depth four circuits with multiplication gates of small fanin implies a nearly complete derandomization of general identity testing.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Geodesic Inf.
