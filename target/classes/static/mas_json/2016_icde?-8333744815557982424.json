{"title": "FastFunction: Replacing a herd of lemmings with a cheetah a ruby framework for interaction with PostgreSQL databases.", "fields": ["data mining", "response time", "web application", "object relational impedance mismatch", "herd"], "abstract": "The ability of web applications to respond fast is critical to the success of any web-based business, and time spent on the interaction with the database is often the most time-consuming portion of the overall response time. Although recent research suggest lots of proven algorithms to improve this interaction, the technicalities of implementation are often considered too time consuming by application developers. In this paper we present a tool that eliminates a significant portion of these technical difficulties and allows almost seamless incorporation of complex database queries and functions into object-oriented applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Enova, Chicago, USA", "Enova, Chicago, USA", "Enova, Chicago, USA"], "authors": ["Henrietta Dombrovskaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dombrovskaya:Henrietta", "Srivathsava Rangarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangarajan:Srivathsava", "Jonathan Marks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marks:Jonathan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
