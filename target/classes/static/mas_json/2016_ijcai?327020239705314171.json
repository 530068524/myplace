{"title": "Robust Iterative Quantization for Efficient \u2113", "fields": ["hash function", "noisy data", "orthogonality", "norm", "nearest neighbor search"], "abstract": "Iterative Quantization (ITQ) is one of the most successful hashing based nearest-neighbor search methods for large-scale information retrieval in the past a few years due to its simplicity and superior performance. However, the performance of this algorithm degrades significantly when dealing with noisy data. Additionally, it can barely facilitate a wide range of applications as the distortion measurement only limits to l2 norm. In this paper, we propose an ITQ+ algorithm, aiming to enhance both robustness and generalization of the original ITQ algorithm. Specifically, a lp,q-norm loss function is proposed to conduct the lp-norm similarity search, rather than a l2 norm search. Despite the fact that changing the loss function to lp,q-norm makes our algorithm more robust and generic, it brings us a challenge that minimizes the obtained orthogonality constrained lp,q-norm function, which is non-smooth and non-convex. To solve this problem, we propose a novel and efficient optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ITQ+ is overwhelmingly better than the original ITQ algorithm, especially when searching similarity in noisy data.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Northumbria University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yuchen Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yuchen", "Guiguang Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Guiguang", "Jungong Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jungong", "Xiaoming Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xiaoming"], "pages": 7}
