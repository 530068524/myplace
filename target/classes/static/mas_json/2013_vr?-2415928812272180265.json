{"title": "A convex decomposition methodology for collision detection.", "fields": ["mesh generation", "regular polygon", "collision detection", "haptic technology", "approximation theory"], "abstract": "In this paper, a shape decomposition methodology to decompose the cervical spine using an approximate convex methodology is proposed. The proposed methodology identifies the most concave L-ring neighborhood in a decomposition of a surface (manifold-2) and partitions it in order to reduce its concavity. A close approximation of the original surface by a set of convex surfaces hulls is then produced.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Ashirwad Joseph Chowriappa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chowriappa:Ashirwad_Joseph", "Raul Wirz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wirz:Raul", "Aditya R.
