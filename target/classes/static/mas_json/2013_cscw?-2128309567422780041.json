Even though the role of technology in mediating essential family interactions has been a longstanding focus within HCI and CSCW, the experience of periodic family reunion and its relationship with technology use while apart is little explored. To address this gap, we conducted a field study with nine families from two different professional backgrounds - defence and academic. Through a comparison between the two cohorts, our findings generate a qualitative understanding of the experience of reunion and describe specific aspects of this experience that are influenced by technology-use while apart. We discuss the complexity of this relationship and reflect on the role of technology in shaping the experience of periodic family reunion.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Konstantinos Kazakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazakos:Konstantinos", "Steve Howard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Howard:Steve", "Frank Vetere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vetere:Frank"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
