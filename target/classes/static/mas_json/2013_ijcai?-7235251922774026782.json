To do so, we use information about previous group recommendation events and copy ratings from a user who played a similar role in some previous group event. We show that copying in this way, i.e. conditioned on groups, is superior to copying nothing and also superior to copying ratings from the most similar user known to the system.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Complutense University of Madrid", "University College Cork", "Complutense University of Madrid", "Complutense University of Madrid"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Lara Quijano S\u00e1nchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=aacute=nchez:Lara_Quijano", "Derek G.
