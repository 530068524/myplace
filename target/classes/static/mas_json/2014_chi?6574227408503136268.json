We find trigger-action programming can express most desired behaviors submitted by participants in an online study. We identify a class of triggers requiring machine learning that has received little attention. We evaluate the uniqueness of the 67,169 trigger-action programs shared on IFTTT.com, finding that real users have written a large number of unique trigger-action interactions. Finally, we conduct a 226-participant usability test of trigger-action programming, finding that inexperienced users can quickly learn to create programs containing multiple triggers or actions.", "citation": "Citations (160)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Blase Ur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ur:Blase", "Elyse McManus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McManus:Elyse", "Melwyn Pak Yong Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Melwyn_Pak_Yong", "Michael L.
