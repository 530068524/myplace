This problem type has many practical applications in logistics and personalized location-based services, and is closely related to the NP-hard Generalized Traveling Salesman Path Problem (GTSPP). In this work, we present a new dynamic programming formulation to highlight the structure of this problem. Using this formulation as our foundation, we progressively engineer a fast and scalable GSP query algorithm for use on large, real-world road networks. Our approach incorporates concepts from Contraction Hierarchies, a well-known graph indexing technique for static shortest path queries. To demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm we experimented on the North American road network (with over 50 million edges) where we achieved up to several orders of magnitude speed improvements over the previous-best algorithm, depending on the relative sizes of the location categories.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of California, Riverside"], "authors": ["Michael N.
