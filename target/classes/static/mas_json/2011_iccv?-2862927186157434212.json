Conventional methods require densely obtained training samples on the eye appearance manifold, which results in a tedious calibration stage. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive linear regression (ALR) method for accurate mapping via sparsely collected training samples. The key idea is to adaptively find the subset of training samples where the test sample is most linearly representable. We solve the problem via l 1 -optimization and thoroughly study the key issues to seek for the best solution for regression. The proposed gaze estimation approach based on ALR is naturally sparse and low-dimensional, giving the ability to infer human gaze from variant resolution eye images using much fewer training samples than existing methods. Especially, the optimization procedure in ALR is extended to solve the subpixel alignment problem simultaneously for low resolution test eye images. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated by extensive experiments against various factors such as number of training samples, feature dimensionality and eye image resolution to verify its effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Feng Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0005:Feng", "Yusuke Sugano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugano:Yusuke", "Takahiro Okabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okabe:Takahiro", "Yoichi Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Yoichi"], "pages": 8}
