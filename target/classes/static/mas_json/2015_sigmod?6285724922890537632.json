{"title": "Minimizing Commit Latency of Transactions in Geo-Replicated Data Stores.", "fields": ["x open xa", "geo replication", "three phase commit protocol", "compensating transaction", "two phase commit protocol"], "abstract": "Cross datacenter replication is increasingly being deployed to bring data closer to the user and to overcome datacenter outages. The extent of the influence of wide-area communication on serializable transactions is not yet clear. In this work, we derive a lower-bound on commit latency. The sum of the commit latency of any two datacenters is at least the Round-Trip Time (RTT) between them. We use the insights and lessons learned while deriving the lower-bound to develop a commit protocol, called Helios, that achieves low commit latencies. Helios actively exchanges transaction logs (history) between datacenters. The received logs are used to decide whether a transaction can commit or not. The  earliest  point in the received logs that is needed to commit a transaction is decided by Helios to ensure a low commit latency. As we show in the paper, Helios is theoretically able to achieve the lower-bound commit latency. Also, in a real-world deployment on five datacenters, Helios has a commit latency that is close to the optimal.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "US Santa Barbar ... ta Barbara, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Faisal Nawab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nawab:Faisal", "Vaibhav Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora:Vaibhav", "Divyakant Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Divyakant", "Amr El Abbadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbadi:Amr_El"], "pages": 16}
