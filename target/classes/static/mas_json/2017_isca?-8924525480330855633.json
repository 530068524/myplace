{"title": "HeteroOS: OS Design for Heterogeneous Memory Management in Datacenter.", "fields": ["uniform memory access", "interleaved memory", "page fault", "extended memory", "flat memory model"], "abstract": "Heterogeneous memory management combined with server virtualization in datacenters is expected to increase the software and OS management complexity. State-of-the-art solutions rely exclusively on the hypervisor (VMM) for expensive page hotness tracking and migrations, limiting the benefits from heterogeneity. To address this, we design HeteroOS, a novel application-transparent OS-level solution for managing memory heterogeneity in virtualized system. The HeteroOS design first makes the guest-OSes heterogeneity-aware and then extracts rich OS-level information about applications' memory usage to place data in the 'right' memory avoiding page migrations. When such pro-active placements are not possible, HeteroOS combines the power of the guest-OSes' information about applications with the VMM's hardware control to track for hotness and migrate only performance-critical pages. Finally, HeteroOS also designs an efficient heterogeneous memory sharing across multiple guest-VMs. Evaluation of HeteroOS with memory, storage, and network-intensive datacenter applications shows up to 2x performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art VMM-exclusive approach.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "VMware", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sudarsun Kannan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kannan:Sudarsun", "Ada Gavrilovska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gavrilovska:Ada", "Vishal Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Vishal", "Karsten Schwan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwan:Karsten"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
