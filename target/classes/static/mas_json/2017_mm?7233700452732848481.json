For the human-being, such similarity can be defined with respect to where they pay attention to and what semantic attributes they understand. Inspired by this fact, this paper presents two-stream attentive CNNs for image retrieval. As the human-being does, the proposed network has two streams that simultaneously handle two tasks. The Main stream focuses on extracting discriminative visual features that are tightly correlated with semantic attributes. Meanwhile, the Auxiliary stream aims to facilitate the main stream by redirecting the feature extraction operation mainly to the image content that human may pay attention to. By fusing these two streams into the Main and Auxiliary CNNs (MAC), image similarity can be computed as the human-being does by reserving the conspicuous content and suppressing the irrelevant regions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model achieves impressive performance in image retrieval on four public datasets.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Beijing Jiaotong University", "Beihang University", "Beijing Jiaotong University", "Beijing Jiaotong University", "Beijing Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Fei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Fei", "Jia Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jia", "Shikui Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Shikui", "Qinjie Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Qinjie", "Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ting", "Yao Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yao"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
