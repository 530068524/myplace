{"title": "Multinomial Logit Bandit with Linear Utility Functions.", "fields": ["multinomial logistic regression", "mathematical optimization", "regret", "linear function", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "Multinomial logit bandit is a sequential subset selection problem which arises in many applications. In each round, the player selects a $K$-cardinality subset from $N$ candidate items, and receives a reward which is governed by a {\\it multinomial logit} (MNL) choice model considering both item utility and substitution property among items. The player's objective is to dynamically learn the parameters of MNL model and maximize cumulative reward over a finite horizon $T$. This problem faces the exploration-exploitation dilemma, and the involved combinatorial nature makes it non-trivial. In recent years, there have developed some algorithms by exploiting specific characteristics of the MNL model, but all of them estimate the parameters of MNL model separately and incur a regret no better than $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\sqrt{NT}\\big)$ which is not preferred for large candidate set size $N$. In this paper, we consider the {\\it linear utility} MNL choice model whose item utilities are represented as linear functions of $d$-dimension item features, and propose an algorithm, titled {\\bf LUMB}, to exploit the underlying structure. It is proven that the proposed algorithm achieves $\\tilde{O}\\big(dK\\sqrt{T}\\big)$ regret which is free of candidate set size. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Alibaba Group", "Alibaba Group", "Alibaba Group", "Alibaba Group"], "authors": ["Mingdong Ou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ou:Mingdong", "Nan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Nan", "Shenghuo Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Shenghuo", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
