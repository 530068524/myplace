We describe a system --- Ivy --- for interactively verifying safety of infinite-state systems. Ivy's key principle is that whenever verification fails, Ivy graphically displays a concrete counterexample to induction. The user then interactively guides generalization from this counterexample. This process continues until an inductive invariant is found. Ivy searches for universally quantified invariants, and uses a restricted modeling language. This ensures that all verification conditions can be checked algorithmically. All user interactions are performed using graphical models, easing the user's task. We describe our initial experience with verifying several distributed protocols.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Microsoft", "University of California, Berkeley", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Oded Padon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padon:Oded", "Kenneth L.
