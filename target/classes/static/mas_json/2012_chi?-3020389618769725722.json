With caps, each bit of data consumed comes at a cost against a monthly quota or a running tab. Yet, relatively little work has considered the implications of this usage-based pricing model on the user experience. In this paper, we present results from a qualitative study of households living with bandwidth caps. Our findings suggest home users grapple with three uncertainties regarding their bandwidth usage:  invisible balances, mysterious processes , and  multiple users . We discuss how these uncertainties impact their usage and describe the potential for better tools to help monitor and manage data caps. We conclude that as a community we need to cater for users under Internet cost constraints.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Marshini Chetty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chetty:Marshini", "Richard Banks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banks:Richard", "A.
