To achieve throughput-optimality, traditional back-pressure algorithms calculate a maximal weight matching at each time slot. However, these algorithms need centralized scheduling with high complexity, and thus are not suitable for practical distributed implementations. A class of distributed queue-length-based CSMA algorithms have been proposed that achieve throughput optimality, which we refer to as regular throughput-optimal. These algorithms suffer from two problems: large delays, and temporal starvation. In this demo we demonstrate the operation of the v(t)-regulated CSMA algorithm that mitigates these two problems while provably retaining throughput optimality. The demo allows the participants to see the the performance advantage of v(t)-regulated CSMA over queue-length-based CSMA algorithms and change the different system parameters.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Alexandria University", "Alexandria University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Ahmed Elbagoury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elbagoury:Ahmed", "Moustafa Youssef.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Youssef:Moustafa", "Dongyue Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Dongyue", "Eylem Ekici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ekici:Eylem"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
