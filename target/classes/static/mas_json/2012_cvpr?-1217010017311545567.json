In this paper, we present a novel joint dictionary learning (JDL) algorithm to exploit the visual correlation within a group of visually similar object categories for dictionary learning where a commonly shared dictionary and multiple category-specific dictionaries are accordingly modeled. To enhance the discrimination of the dictionaries, the dictionary learning problem is formulated as a joint optimization by adding a discriminative term on the principle of the Fisher discrimination criterion. As well as presenting the JDL model, a classification scheme is developed to better take advantage of the multiple dictionaries that have been trained. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on popular visual benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "Northwest University", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ning Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Ning", "Yi Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yi", "Jinye Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Jinye", "Jianping Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan_0001:Jianping"], "pages": 8}
