{"title": "Learning Language Games through Interaction.", "fields": ["scratch", "principle of compositionality", "synonym", "constructed language", "blocks world"], "abstract": "We introduce a new language learning setting relevant to building adaptive natural language interfaces. It is inspired by Wittgenstein\u2019s language games: a human wishes to accomplish some task (e.g., achieving a certain configuration of blocks), but can only communicate with a computer, who performs the actual actions (e.g., removing all red blocks). The computer initially knows nothing about language and therefore must learn it from scratch through interaction, while the human adapts to the computer\u2019s capabilities. We created a game called SHRDLURN in a blocks world and collected interactions from 100 people playing it. First, we analyze the humans\u2019 strategies, showing that using compositionality and avoiding synonyms correlates positively with task performance. Second, we compare computer strategies, showing that modeling pragmatics on a semantic parsing model accelerates learning for more strategic players.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sida I.
