{"title": "Founding Cryptography on Oblivious Transfer - Efficiently.", "fields": ["secure two party computation", "oblivious transfer", "pseudorandom generator", "cryptographic primitive", "divide and choose"], "abstract": "We present a simple and efficient compiler for transforming secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols that enjoy security only with an honest majority into MPC protocols that guarantee security with no honest majority, in the oblivious-transfer (OT) hybrid model. Our technique works by combining a secure protocol in the honest majority setting with a protocol achieving only security against  semi-honest parties in the setting of no honest majority.\n\nApplying our compiler to variants of protocols from the literature, we get several applications for secure two-party computation and for MPC with no honest majority. These include:\n\n\n Constant-rate two-party computation in the OT-hybrid model. We obtain a statistically UC-secure two-party protocol in the OT-hybrid model that can evaluate a general circuit  C of size  s and depth  d with a total communication complexity of  O ( s ) +  poly ( k ,  d , log  s ) and  O ( d ) rounds. The above result generalizes to a constant number of parties.\n Extending OTs in the malicious model. We obtain a computationally efficient protocol for generating many string OTs from few string OTs with only a  constant amortized communication overhead compared to the total length of the string OTs.\n Black-box constructions for constant-round MPC with no honest majority. We obtain general computationally UC-secure MPC protocols in the OT-hybrid model that use only a constant number of rounds, and only make a  black-box access to a pseudorandom generator. This gives the first constant-round protocols for three or more parties that only make a black-box use of cryptographic primitives (and avoid expensive zero-knowledge proofs).", "citation": "Citations (322)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Yuval Ishai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishai:Yuval", "Manoj Prabhakaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakaran:Manoj", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 20}
