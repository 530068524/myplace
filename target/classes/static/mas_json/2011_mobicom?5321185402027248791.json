{"title": "Overlapping communities in dynamic networks: their detection and mobile applications.", "fields": ["scratch", "community structure", "cellular network", "dynamic network analysis", "tracing"], "abstract": "Many practical problems on Mobile networking, such as routing strategies in MANETs, sensor reprogramming in WSNs and worm containment in online social networks (OSNs) share an ubiquitous, yet interesting feature in their organizations: community structure. Knowledge of this structure provides us not only crucial information about the network principles, but also key insights into designing more effective algorithms for practical problems enabled by Mobile networking. However, understanding this interesting feature is extremely challenging on dynamic networks where changes to their topologies are frequently introduced, and especially when network communities in reality usually overlap with each other. We focus on the following questions (1) Can we effectively detect the overlapping community structure in a  dynamic network ? (2) Can we quickly and adaptively update the network structure only based on its history without recomputing from scratch? (3) How does the detection of network communities help mobile applications? We propose AFOCS, a two-phase framework for not only detecting quickly but also tracing effectively the evolution of overlapped network communities in dynamic mobile networks. With the great advantages of the overlapping community structure, AFOCS significantly helps in reducing up to 7 times the infection rates in worm containment on OSNs, and up to 11 times overhead while maintaining good delivery time and ratio in forwarding strategies in MANETs.", "citation": "Citations (191)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Nam P.
