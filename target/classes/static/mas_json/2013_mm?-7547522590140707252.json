The attribute is expected to be both discriminative and representative, which corresponds to a distinctive visual pattern and associates with semantic interpretation. For solution, we analyze the attribute at region level. Each segmented region in the training set is assigned a binary latent variable indicating its discriminative capability. A latent learning framework is proposed for discriminative region detection and geo-informative attribute discovery. Moreover, we use user-generated content to obtain the semantic interpretation for the discovered visual attribute. The proposed approach are evaluated on one challenging dataset including GoogleStreetView and Flickr photos. Experimental results show that: (1) geo-informative attribute are discriminative and useful for location recognition; (2) the discovered semantic interpretation is meaningful and can be exploited for further explorations.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Quan Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Quan", "Jitao Sang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sang:Jitao", "Changsheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Changsheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
