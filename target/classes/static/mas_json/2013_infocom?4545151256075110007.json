Often, IP addresses are reused for several services, and the mapping between domain names and IPs has become highly agile. This complicates the analysis of monitoring data, as it is not clear anymore which IP address represents which service at which time. We propose a system that continuously monitors this activity using captured DNS packets in a large network. Thereby we are able to (i) understand the allocation strategies inside a hosting provider, and (ii) report significant changes that are not due the normal agility of a particular service. We evaluate our system using a 2-weeks data set from a large network operator, and demonstrate how it can be used to find malicious sites.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Vienna", "FTW Telecommun. ...
