In this paper, we describe SystemT, a rule-based IE system whose basic design removes the expressivity and performance limitations of current systems based on cascading grammars. SystemT uses a declarative rule language, AQL, and an optimizer that generates high-performance algebraic execution plans for AQL rules. We compare SystemT's approach against cascading grammars, both theoretically and with a thorough experimental evaluation. Our results show that SystemT can deliver result quality comparable to the state-of-the-art and an order of magnitude higher annotation throughput.", "citation": "Citations (143)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Laura Chiticariu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiticariu:Laura", "Rajasekar Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Rajasekar", "Yunyao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Yunyao", "Sriram Raghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavan:Sriram", "Frederick Reiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reiss:Frederick", "Shivakumar Vaithyanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaithyanathan:Shivakumar"], "pages": 10}
