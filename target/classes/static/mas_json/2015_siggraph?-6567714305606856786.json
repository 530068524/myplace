These are varied in some of their geometrical properties---typically the length---in order to influence their acoustic behavior. Most instruments in this family do not deviate from simple geometrical shapes, since designing the natural frequency spectrum of complex shapes usually involves a pain-staking trial-and-error process and has been reserved to gifted artisans or professional manufacturers.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Christian Hafner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hafner_0002:Christian", "Przemyslaw Musialski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Musialski:Przemyslaw", "Thomas Auzinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Auzinger:Thomas", "Michael Wimmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wimmer:Michael", "Leif Kobbelt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobbelt:Leif"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
