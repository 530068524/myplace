However, strong privacy concerns prevent individuals to benefit from large-scale analytics that could be performed on this fine-grain highly sensitive wealth of data. We propose a demonstration of Chiaroscuro, a complete solution for clustering massively-distributed sensitive personal data while guaranteeing their privacy. The demonstration scenario highlights the affordability of the privacy vs. quality and privacy vs. performance tradeoffs by dissecting the inner working of Chiaroscuro - launched over energy consumption times-series -, by exposing the results obtained by the individuals participating in the clustering process, and by illustrating possible uses.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "IRISA & Univ.
