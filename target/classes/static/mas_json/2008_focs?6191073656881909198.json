By contrast, our understanding of the lscr infin  norm is now where it was (exactly) 10 years ago. In FOCSpsila98, Indyk proved the following unorthodox result: there is a data structure (in fact, a decision tree) of size O(n rho ), for any rho > 1, which achieves approximation O(log rho  log d) for NNS in the d-dimensional lscr 1  metric. In this paper, we provide results that indicate that Indykpsilas unconventional bound might in fact be optimal. Specifically, we show a lower bound for the asymmetric communication complexity of NNS under lscrinfin, which proves that this space/approximation trade-off is optimal for decision trees and for data structures with constant cell-probe complexity.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Massachusetts I ... , Cambridge, MA", "Massachusetts I ... , Cambridge, MA", "Massachusetts I ... , Cambridge, MA"], "authors": ["Alexandr Andoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andoni:Alexandr", "Dorian Croitoru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Croitoru:Dorian", "Mihai Patrascu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patrascu:Mihai"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
