The resource is automatically constructed by means of a methodology that integrates lexicographic and encyclopedic knowledge from WordNet and Wikipedia. In addition Machine Translation is also applied to enrich the resource with lexical information for all languages. We conduct experiments on new and existing gold-standard datasets to show the high quality and coverage of the resource.", "citation": "Citations (397)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto", "Simone Paolo Ponzetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponzetto:Simone_Paolo"], "pages": 10}
