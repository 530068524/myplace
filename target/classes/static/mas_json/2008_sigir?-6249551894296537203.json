Therefore, it is in users' best interest to utilize multiple search engines. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a framework that maximizes users' search effective-ness by directing them to the engine that yields the best results for the current query. In contrast to prior work on meta-search, we do not advocate for replacement of multiple engines with an aggregate one, but rather facilitate simultaneous use of individual engines. We describe a machine learning approach to supporting switching between search engines and demonstrate its viability at tolerable interruption levels. Our findings have implications for fluid competition between search engines.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Ryen W.
