We show that the addition of near-infrared information leads to significantly improved performance in a scene-recognition task, and that the improvements are greater still when an appropriate 4-dimensional colour representation is used. In particular we propose MSIFT\u2013a multispectral SIFT descriptor that, when combined with a kernel based classifier, exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art scene recognition techniques (e.g., GIST) and their multispectral extensions. We extensively test our algorithms using a new dataset of several hundred RGB-NIR scene images, as well as benchmarking against Torralba's scene categorization dataset.", "citation": "Citations (190)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Matthew A.
