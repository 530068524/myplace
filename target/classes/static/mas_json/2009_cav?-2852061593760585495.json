Our algorithm, which can be viewed as a semantic generalization of the  branch-and-bound  technique, systematically discovers and excludes entire subspaces of the solution space containing no integer points. Our main insight is that by focusing on the  defining constraints  of a vertex, we can compute a  proof of unsatisfiability  for the intersection of the defining constraints and use this proof to systematically exclude subspaces of the feasible region with no integer points. We show experimentally that our technique significantly outperforms the top four competitors in the QF-LIA category of the SMT-COMP '08 when solving linear inequalities over integers.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Isil Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Isil", "Thomas Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Thomas", "Alex Aiken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aiken:Alex"], "pages": 15}
