Interactive installations draw from the concepts of the New Aesthetic and Relational Aesthetics to create art that depends on cutting-edge technology while emphasizing human interaction and connectedness. The use of graphics that respond in real-time are a hallmark of the medium. Immediate responses from the technology allow the user to engage with the artwork instantaneously. By doing so, they can create meanings that are unique to themselves.   My interactive art installation, Circles and Sounds, combines art and technology in a way that will allow the user to engage with the technology to create their own real-time graphics and sound experience that is completely unique to them.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Savannah College of Art and Design"], "authors": ["Sarah Linebaugh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linebaugh:Sarah"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
