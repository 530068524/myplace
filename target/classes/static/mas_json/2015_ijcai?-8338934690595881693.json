Due to uncertainty in the environment and the inability of the planner to consider all human preferences and all attributes of the real-world, humans may reject plans computed by the agent. A naive solution that replans given a rejection is inefficient and does not guarantee the new plan will be acceptable. Hence, we propose a new model re-planning problem using a Multi-agent Markov Decision Process that integrates potential rejections as part of the planning process and propose a novel algorithm to efficiently solve this new model. We empirically evaluate our algorithm and show that it outperforms current benchmarks. Our algorithm is also shown to perform better in pilot studies with real humans.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Southampton", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Feng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Feng", "Sarvapali D.
