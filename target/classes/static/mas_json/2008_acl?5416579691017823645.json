{"title": "Applying a Grammar-Based Language Model to a Simplified Broadcast-News Transcription Task.", "fields": ["language model", "phrase structure grammar", "grammar", "parse tree", "cache language model"], "abstract": "We propose a language model based on a precise, linguistically motivated grammar (a hand-crafted Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar) and a statistical model estimating the probability of a parse tree. The language model is applied by means of an N-best rescoring step, which allows to directly measure the performance gains relative to the baseline system without rescoring. To demonstrate that our approach is feasible and beneficial for non-trivial broad-domain speech recognition tasks, we applied it to a simplified German broadcast-news transcription task. We report a significant reduction in word error rate compared to a state-of-the-art baseline system.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Tobias Kaufmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufmann:Tobias", "Beat Pfister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfister:Beat"], "pages": 8}
