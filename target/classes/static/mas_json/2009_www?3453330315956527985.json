{"title": "Analyzing seller practices in a Brazilian marketplace.", "fields": ["negotiation", "product", "common value auction", "e commerce", "revenue"], "abstract": "E-commerce is growing at an exponential rate. In the last decade, there has been an explosion of online commercial activity enabled by World Wide Web (WWW). These days, many consumers are less attracted to online auctions, preferring to buy merchandise quickly using fixed-price negotiations. Sales at Amazon.com, the leader in online sales of fixed-price goods, rose 37% in the first quarter of 2008. At eBay, where auctions make up 58% of the site's sales, revenue rose 14%. In Brazil, probably by cultural influence, online auctions are not been popular. This work presents a characterization and analysis of fixed-price online negotiations. Using actual data from a Brazilian marketplace, we analyze seller practices, considering seller profiles and strategies. We show that different sellers adopt strategies according to their interests, abilities and experience. Moreover, we confirm that choosing a selling strategy is not simple, since it is important to consider the seller's characteristics to evaluate the applicability of a strategy. The work also provides a comparative analysis of some selling practices in Brazil with popular worldwide marketplaces.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "University of Arizona"], "authors": ["Adriano C.
