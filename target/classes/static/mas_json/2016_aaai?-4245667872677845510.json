{"title": "Toward a Better Understanding of Deep Neural Network Based Acoustic Modelling: An Empirical Investigation.", "fields": ["best practice", "acoustic model", "rectifier", "early stopping", "stochastic gradient descent"], "abstract": "Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have outperformed traditional acoustic models on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks. However, due to system differences across research groups, although a tremendous breadth and depth of related work has been established, it is still not easy to assess the performance improvements of a particular architectural variant from examining the literature when building DNN acoustic models.\n\nOur work aims to uncover which variations among baseline systems are most relevant for automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance via a series of systematic tests on the limits of the major architectural choices. By holding all the other components fixed, we are able to explore the design and training decisions without being confounded by the other influencing factors.\n\nOur experiment results suggest that a relatively simple DNN architecture and optimization technique produces strong results. These findings, along with previous work, not only help build a better understanding towards why DNN acoustic models perform well or how they might be improved, but also help establish a set of best practices for new speech corpora and language understanding task variants.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Xingfu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xingfu", "Lin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lin", "Jing Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jing", "Litao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Litao"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
