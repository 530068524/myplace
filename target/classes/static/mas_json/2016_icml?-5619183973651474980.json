{"title": "Solving Ridge Regression using Sketched Preconditioned SVRG.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "ridge", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We develop a novel preconditioning method for ridge regression, based on recent linear sketching methods. By equipping Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) with this preconditioning process, we obtain a significant speed-up relative to fast stochastic methods such as SVRG, SDCA and SAG.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Yahoo!", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Alon Gonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonen:Alon", "Francesco Orabona.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orabona:Francesco", "Shai Shalev-Shwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalev=Shwartz:Shai"], "pages": 9}
