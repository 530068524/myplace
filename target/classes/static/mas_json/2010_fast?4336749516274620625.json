The focus of our investigation is not only measured endurance, but underlying factors at the level of chips and algorithms--both typical and ideal--which determine the endurance of a device.\n\nOur chip-level measurements show endurance far in excess of nominal values quoted by manufacturers, by a factor of as much as 100. We reverse engineer specifics of the Flash Translation Layers (FTLs) used by several devices, and find a close correlation between measured whole-device endurance and predictions from reverse-engineered FTL parameters and measured chip endurance values. We present methods based on analysis of operation latency which provide a non-intrusive mechanism for determining FTL parameters. Finally we present Monte Carlo simulation results giving numerical bounds on endurance achievable by any on-line algorithm in the face of arbitrary or malicious access patterns.", "citation": "Citations (170)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Simona Boboila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boboila:Simona", "Peter Desnoyers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desnoyers:Peter"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2010", "pages": 14}
