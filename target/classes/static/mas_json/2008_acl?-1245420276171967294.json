We show that prior work in translating lattices using finite state techniques can be naturally extended to more expressive synchronous context-free grammarbased models. Additionally, we resolve a significant complication that non-linear word lattice inputs introduce in reordering models. Our experiments evaluating the approach demonstrate substantial gains for ChineseEnglish and Arabic-English translation.", "citation": "Citations (170)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Christopher Dyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dyer:Christopher", "Smaranda Muresan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muresan:Smaranda", "Philip Resnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Resnik:Philip"], "pages": 9}
