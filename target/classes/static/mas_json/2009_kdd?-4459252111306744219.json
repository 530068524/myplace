We call this the T EAM  F ORMATION  problem. We require that members of  X'  not only meet the skill requirements of the task, but can also work effectively together as a team. We measure effectiveness using the  communication cost  incurred by the subgraph in  G  that only involves  X' . We study two variants of the problem for two different communication-cost functions, and show that both variants are NP-hard. We explore their connections with existing combinatorial problems and give novel algorithms for their solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the T EAM  F ORMATION  problem in the presence of a social network of individuals. Experiments on the DBLP dataset show that our framework works well in practice and gives useful and intuitive results.", "citation": "Citations (460)", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Theodoros Lappas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lappas:Theodoros", "Kun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Kun", "Evimaria Terzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terzi:Evimaria"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
