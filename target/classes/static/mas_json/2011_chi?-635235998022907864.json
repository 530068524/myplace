A shadow representing the user's thumb touches the screen, presses a button, flicks a cover-flow list, and draws a simple stroke, while the thumb stays and moves on and above the touchpad. In order to implement the concept we developed an optical touchpad for tracking the thumb hovering over its surface, and designed a TV application to demonstrate possible new interaction styles. Throughout two iterations of prototyping, we corrected some of our false expectations, and also verified its potential as a viable option for a TV remote control. This paper presents technical issues and requirements for the hover-tracking touchpad and a complete report of our user studies to explore touch-screen-like interaction for the TV.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sangwon Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Sangwon", "Jaehyun Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jaehyun", "Geehyuk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Geehyuk", "Narae Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Narae", "Woohun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Woohun"], "pages": 10}
