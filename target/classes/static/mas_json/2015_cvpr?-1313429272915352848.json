Previous methods heavily rely on explicit detection of the object being interacted, which requires intensive human labour on object annotation. To bypass this constraint and achieve better classification performance, in this work, we propose a novel fine-grained action recognition pipeline by interaction part proposal and discriminative mid-level part mining. Firstly, we generate a large number of candidate object regions using off-the-shelf object proposal tool, e.g., BING. Secondly, these object regions are matched and tracked across frames to form a large spatio-temporal graph based on the appearance matching and the dense motion trajectories through them. We then propose an efficient approximate graph segmentation algorithm to partition and filter the graph into consistent local dense sub-graphs. These sub-graphs, which are spatio-temporal sub-volumes, represent our candidate interaction parts. Finally, we mine discriminative mid-level part detectors from the features computed over the candidate interaction parts. Bag-of-detection scores based on a novel Max-N pooling scheme are computed as the action representation for a video sample. We conduct extensive experiments on human-object interaction datasets including MPII Cooking and MSR Daily Activity 3D. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art action recognition accuracies on the benchmarks, without using any object annotation.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at San Antonio", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Hefei University of Technology", "Hefei University of Technology", "University of Texas at San Antonio"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yang", "Bingbing Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Bingbing", "Richang Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Richang", "Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Meng", "Qi Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian_0001:Qi"], "pages": 9}
