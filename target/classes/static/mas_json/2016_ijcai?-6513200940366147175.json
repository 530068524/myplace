In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for estimating spanning tree centralities with theoretical guarantees on their accuracy. We experimentally demonstrate that our methods are orders of magnitude faster than previous methods. Then, we propose a novel centrality notion of a vertex, called aggregated spanning tree centrality, which also considers the number of connected components obtained by removing the vertex. We also give an efficient algorithm for estimating aggregated spanning tree centrality. Finally, we experimentally show that those spanning tree centralities are useful to identify vulnerable edges and vertices in infrastructure networks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Takanori Hayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayashi_0002:Takanori", "Takuya Akiba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akiba:Takuya", "Yuichi Yoshida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshida:Yuichi"], "pages": 7}
