{"title": "FrameShift: shift your attention, shift the story.", "fields": ["branching", "eye tracking", "gaze", "perception", "narrative"], "abstract": "Attention is a limited resource that intrinsically dictates our perceptions, memories, and behaviors. Further, visuospatial attention correlates highly with user engagement, heart rate, and arousal [El-Nasr et al. 2010]. Artists and interactive game designers strive to capture and direct attention, yet even in the most carefully crafted graphic narratives viewer eye paths -- a proxy for attention -- vary up to 20 percent [McCloud 1994; Jain et al. 2012]. Our aim is to use attentional measures to enrich graphic novel narratives. FrameShift uses eye tracking to measure reader attention and changes text and visual elements later on in the story accordingly. We have built an extensible framework for using attention to introduce perceptual changes in narratives. We use attention as an indirect method for interactions and introduce shiftable frame nodes that change readers' belief states over time.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College"], "authors": ["Rukmini Goswami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goswami:Rukmini", "Tim Tregubov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tregubov:Tim", "Lorie Loeb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loeb:Lorie"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
