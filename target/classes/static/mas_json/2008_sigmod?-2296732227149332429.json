{"title": "Enriching topic-based publish-subscribe systems with related content.", "fields": ["world wide web", "publication", "database", "information retrieval", "computer science", "data mining", "cluster analysis"], "abstract": "This demonstration presents RMFinder (Related Messages Finder), a system that retains the  simplicity and efficiency  of topic-based P2P pub-sub, while providing a  richer service  where users can automatically receive all messages related to those in the topics to which they are subscribed. RMFinder is based on a novel, dynamic, distributed clustering algorithm, that takes advantage of similarities between topic messages to group topics together, into topic-clusters. The clusters adjust automatically to shifts in the focus of the messages published by the topics, as well as to changes in the users interest, and allow for an effective delivery of related messages with minimal overhead.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Rubi Boim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boim:Rubi", "Tova Milo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milo:Tova"], "pages": 4}
