A primary cornerstone of such applications is to discover neighboring devices effectively and efficiently. Despite extensive protocol optimization, current neighbor discovery modalities mainly rely on radio interfaces, whose energy and wake up delay required to initiate, configure and operate these protocols hamper practical applicability. Unlike conventional schemes that actively emit radio tones, we exploit ubiquitous audio events to discover neighbors passively. The rationale is that spatially adjacent neighbors tend to share similar ambient acoustic environments. We propose AIR, an effective and efficient neighbor discovery protocol via low power acoustic sensing to reduce discovery latency. Especially, AIR substantially increases the discovery probability of the first time they turn the radio on. Compared with the state-of-the-art neighbor discovery protocol, AIR significantly decreases the average discovery latency by around 70%, which is promising for supporting vast proximity-based mobile applications.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Keyu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Keyu", "Zheng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Zheng", "Zimu Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zimu", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao", "Lionel M.
