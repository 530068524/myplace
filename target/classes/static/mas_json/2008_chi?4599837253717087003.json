{"title": "The LilyPad Arduino: using computational textiles to investigate engagement, aesthetics, and diversity in computer science education.", "fields": ["technology education", "e textiles", "affordance", "thread", "arduino"], "abstract": "The advent of novel materials (such as conductive fibers) combined with accessible embedded computing platforms have made it possible to re-imagine the landscapes of fabric and electronic crafts--extending these landscapes with the creative range of electronic/computational textiles or  e-textiles . This paper describes the  LilyPad Arduino , a fabric-based construction kit that enables novices to design and build their own soft wearables and other textile artifacts. The kit consists of a microcontroller and an assortment of sensors and actuators in stitch-able packages; these elements can be sewn to cloth substrates and each other with conductive thread to build e-textiles. This paper will introduce the latest version of the kit; reflect on its affordances; present the results of our most recent user studies; and discuss possible directions for future work in the area of personalized e-textile design and its relation to technology education.", "citation": "Citations (416)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Leah Buechley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buechley:Leah", "Michael Eisenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisenberg:Michael", "Jaime Catchen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Catchen:Jaime", "Ali Crockett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crockett:Ali"], "pages": 10}
