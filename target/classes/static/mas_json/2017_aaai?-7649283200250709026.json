Recently, by combining DL with  multiple kernel learning (which is a crucial and effective technique for combining different feature representation information), a few multi-kernel DL methods have been presented to solve the multiple feature representations based classification problem. However, how to improve the representation capability and discriminability of multi-kernel dictionary has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-kernel DL approach, named multi-kernel low-rank dictionary pair learning (MKLDPL). Specifically, MKLDPL jointly learns a  kernel synthesis dictionary and a kernel analysis dictionary by exploiting the class label information. The learned synthesis and analysis dictionaries work together to implement the coding and reconstruction of samples in the kernel space. To enhance the discriminability of the learned multi-kernel dictionaries, MKLDPL imposes the low-rank regularization on the analysis dictionary, which can make samples from the same class have similar representations. We apply MKLDPL for multiple features based image classification task. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Wuhan University", "Wuhan University", "Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Wuhan University", "Wuhan University"], "authors": ["Xiaoke Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaoke", "Xiao-Yuan Jing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jing:Xiao=Yuan", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0004:Fei", "Di Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Di", "Li Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Li", "Sen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Sen", "Ruimin Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Ruimin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
