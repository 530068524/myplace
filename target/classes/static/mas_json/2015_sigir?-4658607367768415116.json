{"title": "Using Sensor Metadata Streams to Identify Topics of Local Events in the City.", "fields": ["social media", "information retrieval", "streams", "video processing", "metadata"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the emerging Information Retrieval (IR) task of local event retrieval using sensor metadata streams. Sensor metadata streams include information such as the crowd density from video processing, audio classifications, and social media activity. We propose to use these metadata streams to identify the topics of local events within a city, where each event topic corresponds to a set of terms representing a type of events such as a concert or a protest. We develop a supervised approach that is capable of mapping sensor metadata observations to an event topic. In addition to using a variety of sensor metadata observations about the current status of the environment as learning features, our approach incorporates additional background features to model cyclic event patterns. Through experimentation with data collected from two locations in a major Spanish city, we show that our approach markedly outperforms an alternative baseline. We also show that modelling background information improves event topic identification.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "School of Compu ...
