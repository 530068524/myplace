{"title": "Engineering search computing applications: vision and challenges.", "fields": ["distributed web crawling", "domain knowledge", "semantic search", "web engineering", "web modeling"], "abstract": "Search computing is a novel discipline whose goal is to answer complex, multi-domain queries. Such queries typically require combining in their results domain knowledge extracted from multiple Web resources; therefore, conventional crawling and indexing techniques, which look at individual Web pages, are not adequate for them. In this paper, we sketch the main characteristics of search computing and we highlight how various classical computer science disciplines - including software engineering, Web engineering, service-oriented architectures, data management, and human-computing interaction - are challenged by the search computing approach.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Marco Brambilla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brambilla_0001:Marco", "Stefano Ceri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceri:Stefano"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
