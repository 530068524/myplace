{"title": "The gram-schmidt walk: a cure for the Banaszczyk blues.", "fields": ["convex body", "open problem", "discrepancy theory", "existential quantification", "norm"], "abstract": "An important result in discrepancy due to Banaszczyk states that for any set of  n  vectors in \u211d  m   of l 2  norm at most 1 and any convex body  K  in \u211d  m   of Gaussian measure at least half, there exists a \u00b1 1 combination of these vectors which lies in 5 K . This result implies the best known bounds for several problems in discrepancy. Banaszczyk\u2019s proof of this result is non-constructive and an open problem has been to give an efficient algorithm to find such a \u00b1 1 combination of the vectors.    In this paper, we resolve this question and give an efficient randomized algorithm to find a \u00b1 1 combination of the vectors which lies in  cK  for  c >0 an absolute constant. This leads to new efficient algorithms for several problems in discrepancy theory.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "University of California, San Diego", "CWI, Netherlands"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Nikhil Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Nikhil", "Daniel Dadush.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dadush:Daniel", "Shashwat Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Shashwat", "Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar"], "pages": 11}
