In many modern applications, software systems must be able to handle multiple flows of various types of multimedia data such as audio and video. Researchers frequently have to rely on a combination of different software tools for each modality to assemble proof-of-concept systems that are inefficient, brittle and hard to maintain. Marsyas is a software framework originally developed to address these issues in the domain of audio processing. In this paper we describe MarsyasX, a new open-source cross-modal analysis framework that aims at a broader score of applications. It follows a dataflow architecture where complex networks of processing objects can be assembled to form systems that can handle multiple and different types of multimedia flows with expressiveness and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "INESC Porto, Porto, Portugal", "INESC Porto, Porto, Portugal"], "authors": ["Lu\u00eds Filipe Teixeira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teixeira:Lu=iacute=s_Filipe", "Luis Gustavo Martins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martins:Luis_Gustavo", "Mathieu Lagrange.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lagrange:Mathieu", "George Tzanetakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tzanetakis:George"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
