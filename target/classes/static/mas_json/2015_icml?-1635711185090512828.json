{"title": "A Nearly-Linear Time Framework for Graph-Structured Sparsity.", "fields": ["sample complexity", "pattern recognition", "graph", "machine learning", "time complexity", "mathematical optimization"], "abstract": "We introduce a framework for sparsity structures defined via graphs. Our approach is flexible and generalizes several previously studied sparsity models. Moreover, we provide efficient projection algorithms for our sparsity model that run in nearly-linear time. In the context of sparse recovery, our framework achieves an information-theoretically optimal sample complexity for a wide range of parameters. We complement our theoretical analysis with experiments showing that our algorithms also improve on prior work in practice.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Chinmay Hegde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hegde:Chinmay", "Piotr Indyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Indyk:Piotr", "Ludwig Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Ludwig"], "pages": 10}
