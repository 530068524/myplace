Berenson et al. showed that data consistency can be violated under SI. Recently, a new class of Serializable SI algorithms (SSI) has been proposed to achieve serializable execution while still allowing concurrency between reads and updates.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "Dongduk Womens  ... ul, South Korea"], "authors": ["Hyuck Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Hyuck", "Seongjae Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Seongjae", "Hyungsoo Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Hyungsoo", "Alan Fekete.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fekete:Alan", "Uwe R\u00f6hm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=ouml=hm:Uwe", "Heon Y.
