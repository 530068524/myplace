{"title": "A Bargaining Mechanism for One-Way Games.", "fields": ["humanitarian logistics", "stochastic game", "payment", "rationality", "social cost"], "abstract": "We introduce one-way games, a framework motivated by applications in large-scale power restoration, humanitarian logistics, and integrated supply-chains. The distinguishable feature of the games is that the payoff of some player is determined only by her own strategy and does not depend on actions taken by other players. We show that the equilibrium outcome in one-way games without payments and the social cost of any ex-post efficient mechanism, can be far from the optimum. We also show that it is impossible to design a Bayes-Nash incentive-compatible mechanism for one-way games that is budget-balanced, individually rational, and efficient. Finally, we propose a privacy-preserving mechanism that is incentive-compatible and budget-balanced, satisfies ex-post individual rationality conditions, and produces an outcome which is more efficient than the equilibrium without payments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "Melbourne Business School", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Andr\u00e9s Abeliuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abeliuk:Andr=eacute=s", "Gerardo Berbeglia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berbeglia:Gerardo", "Pascal Van Hentenryck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hentenryck:Pascal_Van"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
