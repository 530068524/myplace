{"title": "The Web Never Forgets: Persistent Tracking Mechanisms in the Wild.", "fields": ["evercookie", "judgement", "internet security", "javascript", "canvas fingerprinting"], "abstract": "We present the first large-scale studies of three advanced web tracking mechanisms - canvas fingerprinting, evercookies and use of \"cookie syncing\" in conjunction with evercookies. Canvas fingerprinting, a recently developed form of browser fingerprinting, has not previously been reported in the wild; our results show that over 5% of the top 100,000 websites employ it. We then present the first automated study of evercookies and respawning and the discovery of a new evercookie vector, IndexedDB. Turning to cookie syncing, we present novel techniques for detection and analysing ID flows and we quantify the amplification of privacy-intrusive tracking practices due to cookie syncing.    Our evaluation of the defensive techniques used by privacy-aware users finds that there exist subtle pitfalls --- such as failing to clear state on multiple browsers at once - in which a single lapse in judgement can shatter privacy defenses. This suggests that even sophisticated users face great difficulties in evading tracking techniques.", "citation": "Citations (260)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Princeton University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Gunes Acar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acar:Gunes", "Christian Eubank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eubank:Christian", "Steven Englehardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Englehardt:Steven", "Marc Ju\u00e1rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ju=aacute=rez:Marc", "Arvind Narayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanan:Arvind", "Claudia D\u00edaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=iacute=az:Claudia"], "pages": 16}
