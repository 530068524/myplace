{"title": "Split LBI: An Iterative Regularization Path with Structural Sparsity.", "fields": ["ranking", "minimax", "early stopping", "regularization", "lasso"], "abstract": "An iterative regularization path with structural sparsity is proposed in this paper based on variable splitting and the Linearized Bregman Iteration, hence called \\emph{Split LBI}. Despite its simplicity, Split LBI outperforms the popular generalized Lasso in both theory and experiments. A theory of path consistency is presented that equipped with a proper early stopping, Split LBI may achieve model selection consistency under a family of Irrepresentable Conditions which can be weaker than the necessary and sufficient condition for generalized Lasso. Furthermore, some $\\ell_2$ error bounds are also given at the minimax optimal rates. The utility and benefit of the algorithm are illustrated by applications on both traditional image denoising and a novel example on partial order ranking.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Chendi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chendi", "Xinwei Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Xinwei", "Jiechao Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Jiechao", "Yuan Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Yuan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
