{"title": "ProbUI: Generalising Touch Target Representations to Enable Declarative Gesture Definition for Probabilistic GUIs.", "fields": ["callback", "probabilistic logic", "gaussian", "gesture", "usability"], "abstract": "We present  ProbUI , a mobile touch GUI framework that merges ease of use of declarative gesture definition with the benefits of probabilistic reasoning. It helps developers to handle uncertain input and implement feedback and GUI adaptations.  ProbUI  replaces today's static target models (bounding boxes) with probabilistic gestures (\"bounding behaviours\"). It is the first touch GUI framework to unite concepts from three areas of related work: 1) Developers  declaratively define  touch behaviours for GUI targets. As a key insight, the declarations imply simple probabilistic models (HMMs with 2D Gaussian emissions). 2)  ProbUI  derives these models automatically to  evaluate  users' touch sequences. 3) It then  infers  intended behaviour and target. Developers bind callbacks to gesture progress, completion, and other conditions. We show  ProbUI 's value by implementing existing and novel widgets, and report developer feedback from a survey and a lab study.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Buschek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buschek:Daniel", "Florian Alt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alt:Florian"], "pages": 14}
