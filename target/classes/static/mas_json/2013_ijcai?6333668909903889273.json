Each instrument has different coverage and sensitivity to atmospheric and surface conditions, and, as a result, the quality of AOD estimated by different instruments varies across the globe. We present a method for learning how to aggregate AOD estimations from multiple satellite instruments into a more accurate estimation. The proposed method is semi-supervised, as it is able to learn from a small number of labeled data, where labels come from a few accurate and expensive ground-based instruments, and a large number of unlabeled data. The method uses a latent variable to partition the data, so that in each partition the expert AOD estimations are aggregated in a different, optimal way. We applied the method to combine AOD estimations from 5 instruments aboard 4 satellites, and the results indicate that it can successfully exploit labeled and unlabeled data to produce accurate aggregated AOD estimations.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Temple University", "Temple University", "Temple University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Nemanja Djuric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Djuric:Nemanja", "Lakesh Kansakar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kansakar:Lakesh", "Slobodan Vucetic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vucetic:Slobodan"], "pages": 7}
