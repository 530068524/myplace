{"title": "Weakly Supervised Actor-Action Segmentation via Robust Multi-task Ranking.", "fields": ["ranking", "segmentation", "labeled data", "conditional random field", "semantics"], "abstract": "Fine-grained activity understanding in videos has attracted considerable recent attention with a shift from action classification to detailed actor and action understanding that provides compelling results for perceptual needs of cutting-edge autonomous systems. However, current methods for detailed understanding of actor and action have significant limitations: they require large amounts of finely labeled data, and they fail to capture any internal relationship among actors and actions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel, robust multi-task ranking model for weakly supervised actor-action segmentation where only video-level tags are given for training samples. Our model is able to share useful information among different actors and actions while learning a ranking matrix to select representative supervoxels for actors and actions respectively. Final segmentation results are generated by a conditional random field that considers various ranking scores for different video parts. Extensive experimental results on the Actor-Action Dataset (A2D) demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and performs as well as the top-performing fully supervised method.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Rochester", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yan Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Yan", "Chenliang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Chenliang", "Dawen Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Dawen", "Jason J.
