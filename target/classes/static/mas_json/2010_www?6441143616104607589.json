{"title": "Stochastic models for tabbed browsing.", "fields": ["random walk", "pagerank", "birth death process", "branching process", "hyperlink"], "abstract": "We present a model of tabbed browsing that represents a hybrid between a Markov process capturing the graph of hyperlinks, and a branching process capturing the birth and death of tabs. We present a mathematical criterion to characterize whether the process has a steady state independent of initial conditions, and we show how to characterize the limiting behavior in both cases. We perform a series of experiments to compare our tabbed browsing model with pagerank, and show that tabbed browsing is able to explain 15-25% of the deviation between actual measured browsing behavior and the behavior predicted by the simple pagerank model. We find this to be a surprising result, as the tabbed browsing model does not make use of any notion of site popularity, but simply captures deviations in user likelihood to open and close tabs from a particular node in the graph.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Google", "Sapienza Univer ... ma, Rome, Italy"], "authors": ["Flavio Chierichetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chierichetti:Flavio", "Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Ravi", "Andrew Tomkins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomkins:Andrew"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
