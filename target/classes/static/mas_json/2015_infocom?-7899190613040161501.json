Indeed, there is a rising trend in the adoption of gesture recognition systems into various consumer electronics and mobile devices. These systems, along with research enhancing them by exploiting the wide range of sensors available on such devices, generally adopt various techniques for recognizing gestures including computer vision, inertial sensors, ultra-sonic, and infrared. While promising, these techniques experience various limitations such as being tailored for specific applications, sensitivity to lighting, high installation and instrumentation overhead, requiring holding the mobile device, and/or requiring additional sensors to be worn or installed. We present WiGest, a ubiquitous WiFi-based hand gesture recognition system for controlling applications running on off-the-s...", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2015", "departments": [], "conf": "infocom", "authors": ["Heba Abdelnasser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdelnasser:Heba", "Moustafa Youssef.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Youssef:Moustafa", "Khaled A.
