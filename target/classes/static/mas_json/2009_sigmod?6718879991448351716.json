While there is an exhaustive body of literature on querying independent probabilistic data, supporting efficient queries over large-scale, correlated databases remains a challenge. In this paper, we develop efficient data structures and indexes for supporting inference and decision support queries over such databases. Our proposed hierarchical data structure is suitable both for in-memory and disk-resident databases. We represent the correlations in the probabilistic database using a junction tree over the tuple-existence or attribute-value random variables, and use  tree partitioning  techniques to build an index structure over it. We show how to efficiently answer inference and aggregation queries using such an index, resulting in orders of magnitude performance benefits in most cases. In addition, we develop novel algorithms for efficiently keeping the index structure up-to-date as changes (inserts, updates) are made to the probabilistic database. We present a comprehensive experimental study illustrating the benefits of our approach to query processing in probabilistic databases.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Bhargav Kanagal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanagal:Bhargav", "Amol Deshpande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deshpande:Amol"], "pages": 14}
