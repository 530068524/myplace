The popular heuristic-search methods cannot provide theoretical guarantees on stability. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Model Predictive Control scheme that employs reachable sets to decouple the navigation problem of linear dynamical multirobot systems. The proposed control scheme guarantees the stability and feasibility, and is more efficient and viable than other Model Predictive Control schemes, as evidenced by our simulation results.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Shenzhen University", "Teesside University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Chao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chao", "Xin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xin", "Yifan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yifan", "Shengchao Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Shengchao", "Yifeng Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Yifeng", "Xuandong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xuandong"], "pages": 7}
