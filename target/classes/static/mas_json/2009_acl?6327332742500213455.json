Different from system combination and MBR decoding, which post-process the n-best lists or word lattice of machine translation decoders, in our method multiple machine translation decoders collaborate by exchanging partial translation results. Using an iterative decoding approach, n-gram agreement statistics between translations of multiple decoders are employed to re-rank both full and partial hypothesis explored in decoding. Experimental results on data sets for NIST Chinese-to-English machine translation task show that the co-decoding method can bring significant improvements to all baseline decoders, and the outputs from co-decoding can be used to further improve the result of system combination.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Tianjin University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Mu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mu", "Nan Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Nan", "Dongdong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dongdong", "Chi-Ho Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chi=Ho", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
