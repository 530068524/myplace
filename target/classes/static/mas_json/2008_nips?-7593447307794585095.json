The task is highly challenging, largely due to the lack of a meaningful regular-izer on the functions realized by the networks. We propose a novel regularization method that takes advantage of kernel methods, where an oracle kernel function represents prior knowledge about the recognition task of interest. We derive an efficient algorithm using stochastic gradient descent, and demonstrate encouraging results on a wide range of recognition tasks, in terms of both accuracy and speed.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["NEC Laboratorie ...
