As conventional recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering become inapplicable in the problem, we propose a new recommendation method which exploits the implicit matching rules between human faces and eyeglasses. We first define fine-grained attributes for human faces and frames of glasses respectively. Then, we develop a recommendation framework based on a probabilistic graphical model, which effectively captures the correlation among these fine-grained attributes. Ranking of the frames (glasses) is done by their similarity to the query facial attributes. Finally, we produce a synthesized image for the input face to demonstrate the visual effect when wearing the recommended glasses.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Xiaoling Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Xiaoling", "Lidan Shou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shou:Lidan", "Pai Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Pai", "Ke Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0005:Ke", "Sai Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Sai", "Gang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Gang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
