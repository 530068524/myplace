Shuffles of homomorphic encryptions are a key component in mix-nets, which in turn are used in protocols for anonymization and voting. Since the plaintexts are encrypted it is not directly verifiable whether a shuffle is correct, and it is often necessary to prove the correctness of a shuffle using a zero-knowledge proof or argument.\n\nIn previous zero-knowledge shuffle arguments from the literature the communication complexity grows linearly with the number of ciphertexts in the shuffle. We suggest the first practical shuffle argument with sub-linear communication complexity. Our result stems from combining previous work on shuffle arguments with ideas taken from probabilistically checkable proofs.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University College London", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Jens Groth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Groth:Jens", "Yuval Ishai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishai:Yuval"], "pages": 18}
