This paper presents a meta path graph clustering framework, VEPATHCLUSTER, that combines meta path vertex-centric clustering with meta path edge-centric clustering for improving the clustering quality of heterogeneous networks. First, we propose an edge-centric path graph model to capture the meta-path dependencies between pairwise path edges. We model a heterogeneous network containing  M  types of meta paths as  M  vertex-centric path graphs and  M  edge-centric path graphs. Second, we propose a clustering-based multigraph model to capture the fine-grained clustering-based relationships between pairwise vertices and between pairwise path edges. We perform clustering analysis on both a unified vertex-centric path graph and each edge-centric path graph to generate vertex clustering and edge clusterings of the original heterogeneous network respectively. Third, a reinforcement algorithm is provided to tightly integrate vertex-centric clustering and edge-centric clustering by mutually enhancing each other. Finally, an iterative learning strategy is presented to dynamically refine both vertex-centric clustering and edge-centric clustering by continuously learning the contributions and adjusting the weights of different path graphs.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Yang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Yang", "Ling Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ling", "David Buttler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buttler:David"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
