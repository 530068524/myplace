Regression test selection (RTS) aims to speed up regression testing by running only impacted tests\u2014the subset of tests that can change behavior due to code changes. We present STARTS, a tool for STAtic Regression Test Selection. Unlike dynamic RTS, STARTS requires no code instrumentation or runtime information to find impacted tests; instead, STARTS uses only compile-time information. Specifically, STARTS builds a dependency graph of program types and finds, as impacted, tests that can reach some changed type in the transitive closure of the dependency graph. STARTS is a Maven plugin that can be easily integrated into any Maven-based Java project. We find that STARTS selects on average 35.2% of tests, leading to an end-to-end runtime that is on average 81.0% of running all the tests. A video demo of STARTS can be found at https://youtu.be/PCNtk8jphrM.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Owolabi Legunsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Legunsen:Owolabi", "August Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:August", "Darko Marinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinov:Darko"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
