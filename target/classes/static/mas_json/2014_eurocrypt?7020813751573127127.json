This attack uses the fact that such codes can be distinguished from random codes to compute some filtration of nested subcodes which will reveal their secret algebraic description.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Normandie Univ, ... ance, UR, LITIS", "Normandie Universit\u00e9, France"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Alain Couvreur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Couvreur:Alain", "Ayoub Otmani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Otmani:Ayoub", "Jean-Pierre Tillich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tillich:Jean=Pierre"], "pages": 23}
