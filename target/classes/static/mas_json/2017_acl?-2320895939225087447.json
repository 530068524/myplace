{"title": "Joint Modeling of Content and Discourse Relations in Dialogues.", "fields": ["phrase", "machine learning", "discourse relation", "latent variable", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We present a joint modeling approach to identify salient discussion points in spoken meetings as well as to label the discourse relations between speaker turns. A variation of our model is also discussed when discourse relations are treated as latent variables. Experimental results on two popular meeting corpora show that our joint model can outperform state-of-the-art approaches for both phrase-based content selection and discourse relation prediction tasks. We also evaluate our model on predicting the consistency among team members' understanding of their group decisions. Classifiers trained with features constructed from our model achieve significant better predictive performance than the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kechen Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Kechen", "Lu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lu", "Joseph Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Joseph"], "pages": 11}
