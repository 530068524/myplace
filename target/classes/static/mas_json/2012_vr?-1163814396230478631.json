{"title": "Optical camouflage III: Auto-stereoscopic and multiple-view display system using retro-reflective projection technology.", "fields": ["retroreflector", "monocular", "reversing", "stereoscopy", "beam splitter"], "abstract": "This paper presents a new type of optical camouflage system based on the retro-reflective projection technology. Retro-reflective projection is a method used to create augmented reality that combines the virtual world with the real world. The conventional model of an optical camouflage system consists of a retro-reflective screen, a projection source and a beam splitter. In such a setup, the user needs to observe an object covered with the retro-reflective screen through a single viewpoint. This is called a monocular system. In our new setup, our aim is to construct a system that has multiple viewpoints by applying a novel projection array system. We will describe the method with which this projection array system is achieved using one projection source, the configuration of the system, and the trade-offs of the system. In addition, we will describe an application of our system in a car. The installed system makes the backseat virtually transparent, allowing the driver to see the blind spots at the rear when reversing the car.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Yuji Uema.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uema:Yuji", "Naoya Koizumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koizumi:Naoya", "Shian Wei Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Shian_Wei", "Kouta Minamizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minamizawa:Kouta", "Maki Sugimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugimoto:Maki", "Masahiko Inami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inami:Masahiko"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
