The work presented in this paper aims to contribute to a software engineering process which is driven by security, risk and compliance management considerations.   We concentrate on a part of this approach that focusses on the question how one can use software engineering methods and tools to enforce that the configuration of a system enforces the security policies that arise from business compliance regulations. We present tool support for Model-based Compliance Engineering, i.e. for the model-based development and analysis of software configurations that ensures compliance with security policies. It allows one to check UML models of business applications and their configuration data for adherence to security policies and compliance requirements. The tool is based on standardized data formats, such as UML and XML, which makes its integration into existing business architectures as efficient as possible.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "Open University"], "authors": ["Sebastian H\u00f6hn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=hn:Sebastian", "Jan J\u00fcrjens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=uuml=rjens:Jan"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
