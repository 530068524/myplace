{"title": "A Hybrid Decision Approach for the Association Problem in Heterogeneous Networks.", "fields": ["service provider", "radio resource management", "heterogeneous network", "network architecture", "non cooperative game"], "abstract": "The area of networking games has had a growing impact on wireless networks. This reflects the recognition in the important scaling advantages that the service providers can benefit from by increasing the autonomy of mobiles in decision making. This may however result in inefficiencies that are inherent to equilibria in non-cooperative games. Due to the concern for efficiency, centralized protocols keep being considered and compared to decentralized ones. From the point of view of the network architecture, this implies the co-existence of network-centric and terminal centric radio resource management schemes. Instead of taking part within the debate among the supporters of each solution, we propose in this paper hybrid schemes where the wireless users are assisted in their decisions by the network that broadcasts aggregated load information. We derive the utilities related to the Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by the users and develop a Bayesian framework to obtain the equilibria. Numerical results illustrate the advantages of using our hybrid game framework in an association problem in a network composed of HSDPA and 3G LTE systems.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Orange Labs, Is ... ineaux, France", "Orange Labs, Is ... ineaux, France", "Orange Labs, Is ... ineaux, France"], "authors": ["Salah-Eddine Elayoubi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elayoubi:Salah=Eddine", "Eitan Altman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altman:Eitan", "Majed Haddad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haddad:Majed", "Zwi Altman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altman:Zwi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
