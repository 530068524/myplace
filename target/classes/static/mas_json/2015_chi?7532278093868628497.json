{"title": "Gaze-Based Annotations for Reading Comprehension.", "fields": ["gaze", "eye tracking", "social computing", "reading comprehension", "shading"], "abstract": "We study eye gaze movement behavior during paper reading and generate a series of annotations from a user's reading features: gray shading to indicate reading speed, borders to indicate frequency of re-reading, and lines to indicate transitions between sections of a document. Through a user study, we validate that our SocialReading system that shares teachers' gaze data for an academic paper can improve students' reading comprehension of that paper.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Zhejiang University of Technology", "Zhejiang University of Technology", "Zhejiang University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Shiwei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Shiwei", "Zhiqiang Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Zhiqiang", "Lingyun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Lingyun", "Kirsten Yee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yee:Kirsten", "Anind K.
