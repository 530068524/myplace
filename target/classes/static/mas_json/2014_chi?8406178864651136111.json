{"title": "Between theory and practice: bridging concepts in HCI research.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "knowledge management", "bridging", "computer science"], "abstract": "We present the notion of \"bridging concepts\" as a particular form of intermediary knowledge in HCI research, residing between theory and practice. We argue that bridging concepts address the challenge of facilitating exchange between theory and practice in HCI, and we compare it to other intermediary forms of knowledge such as strong concepts and conceptual constructs. We propose that bridging concepts have three defining constituents: a theoretical foundation, a set of design articulations and a range of exemplars that demonstrate the scope and potential of their application. These constituents specify how bridging concepts, as a form of knowledge, are accountable to both theory and practice. We present an analysis of the concept of \"peepholes\" as an example of a bridging concept aimed at spurring user curiosity and engagement.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Peter Dalsg\u00e5rd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dalsg=aring=rd:Peter", "Christian Dindler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dindler:Christian"], "pages": 10}
