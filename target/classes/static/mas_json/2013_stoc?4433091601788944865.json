No deterministic algorithm that outperforms the naive O(n) one was reported up to this date. The only progress in this direction is due to Ivkovic and Lloyd [14], who in 1993 devised a deterministic algorithm with an  amortized  update time of O((n+m) \u221a2/2 ), where m is the number of edges.   In this paper we show the first deterministic fully dynamic algorithm that outperforms the trivial one. Specifically, we provide a deterministic  worst-case  update time of O(\u221am). Moreover, our algorithm maintains a matching which is in fact a 3/2-approximate maximum cardinality matching (MCM). We remark that no fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining (2-e)-approximate MCM improving upon the naive O(n) was known prior to this work, even allowing amortized time bounds and  randomization .   For low arboricity graphs (e.g., planar graphs and graphs excluding fixed minors), we devise another simple deterministic algorithm with  sub-logarithmic update time . Specifically, it maintains a fully dynamic maximal matching with amortized update time of O(log n/log log n). This result addresses an open question of Onak and Rubinfeld [19].   We also show a deterministic algorithm with optimal space usage of O(n+m), that for arbitrary graphs maintains a maximal matching with amortized update time of O(\u221am).", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ofer Neiman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neiman:Ofer", "Shay Solomon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solomon:Shay"], "pages": 10}
