The expected high density of deployment and uncoordinated operations of femtocells however, make interference management both critical and extremely challenging. Femtocells have to use the same access technology as traditional macrocells. Given this, understanding the impact of the system design choices (originally tailored to well-planned macrocells) on interference management, forms an essential first step towards designing efficient solutions for next-generation femtocells. This in turn is the focus of our work. With extensive measurements from our WiMAX OFDMA femtocell testbed, we characterize the impact of various system design choices on interference. Based on the insights from our measurements, we discuss several implications on how to efficiently operate a femtocell network.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of California, Riverside", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "NEC Labs America Inc, USA"], "authors": ["Mustafa Y.
