{"title": "SLIM: Semi-Lazy Inference Mechanism for Plan Recognition.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "commit", "completeness", "inference", "parsing"], "abstract": "Plan Recognition algorithms require to recognize a complete hierarchy explaining the agent's actions and goals. While the output of such algorithms is informative to the recognizer, the cost of its calculation is high in run-time, space, and completeness. Moreover, performing plan recognition online requires the observing agent to reason about future actions that have not yet been seen and maintain a set of hypotheses to support all possible options. This paper presents a new and efficient algorithm for online plan recognition called SLIM (Semi-Lazy Inference Mechanism). It combines both a bottom-up and top-down parsing processes, which allow it to commit only to the minimum necessary actions in real-time, but still provide complete hypotheses post factum. We show both theoretically and empirically that although the computational cost of this process is still exponential, there is a significant improvement in run-time when compared to a state of the art of plan recognition algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Reuth Mirsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mirsky:Reuth", "Ya'akov (Kobi) Gal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gal:Ya=akov_=Kobi="], "pages": 7}
