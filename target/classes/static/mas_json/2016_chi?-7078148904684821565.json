This paper explores the importance of language for the participatory design of smart home technologies for healthcare. We argue that to effectively involve a broad range of users in the design of new technologies, it is important to actively develop a shared language that is accessible to and owned by all stakeholders, and that facilitates productive dialogues among them. Our discussion is grounded firstly in work with end users, in which problematic language emerged as a key barrier to participation and effective design. Three specific categories of language barriers are identified: jargon, ambiguity, and emotive words. Building on this we undertook a workshop and focus group, respectively involving researchers developing smart health technologies and users, where the focus was on generating a shared language. We discuss this process, including examples that emerged of alternative terminology and specific strategies for creating a shared language.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University College Dublin"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alison Burrows.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burrows:Alison", "Rachael Gooberman-Hill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gooberman=Hill:Rachael", "David Coyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coyle:David"], "pages": 11}
