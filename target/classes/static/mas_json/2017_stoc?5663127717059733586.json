Lovasz (1980) showed that this problem admits a min-max formula and a polynomial algorithm for linearly represented matroids. Since then efficient algorithms have been developed for the linear matroid parity problem.   In this paper, we present a combinatorial, deterministic, strongly polynomial algorithm for the weighted linear matroid parity problem. The algorithm builds on a polynomial matrix formulation using Pfaffian and adopts a primal-dual approach with the aid of the augmenting path algorithm of Gabow and Stallmann (1986) for the unweighted problem.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tsukuba"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Satoru Iwata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwata_0001:Satoru", "Yusuke Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi_0001:Yusuke"], "pages": 13}
