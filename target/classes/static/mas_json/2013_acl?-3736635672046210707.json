In particular, we extend the monolingual infinite tree model (Finkel et al., 2007) to a bilingual scenario: each hidden state (POS tag) of a source-side dependency tree emits a source word together with its aligned target word, either jointly (joint model), or independently (independent model). Evaluations of Japanese-to-English translation on the NTCIR-9 data show that our induced Japanese POS tags for dependency trees improve the performance of a forestto-string SMT system. Our independent model gains over 1 point in BLEU by resolving the sparseness problem introduced in the joint model.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Akihiro Tamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamura:Akihiro", "Taro Watanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watanabe:Taro", "Eiichiro Sumita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sumita:Eiichiro", "Hiroya Takamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takamura:Hiroya", "Manabu Okumura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okumura:Manabu"], "pages": 11}
