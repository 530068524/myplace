Using survey data collected from a sample of non-academic staff at a large Midwestern university (N=614), we explore the demographic and cognitive factors that predict whether a person chooses to join Facebook. We find that older adults and those with higher perceived levels of bonding social capital are less likely to use the site. Analyzing open-ended responses from non-users, we find that they express concerns about privacy, context collapse, limited time, and channel effects in deciding to not adopt Facebook. Finally, we compare non-adopters against users who differ on three dimensions of use. We find that light users often have social capital outcomes similar to, or worse than, non-users, and that heavy users report higher perceived bridging and bonding social capital than either group.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Michigan State University"], "authors": ["Cliff Lampe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampe:Cliff", "Jessica Vitak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vitak:Jessica", "Nicole B.
