{"title": "Towards Annotating Relational Data on the Web with Language Models.", "fields": ["ranking", "information extraction", "language model", "question answering", "entity linking"], "abstract": "Tables and structured lists on Web pages have long been identified as a potential source of valuable information, and several methods have been proposed to annotate such tables and lists with semantics that can be leveraged for search, question answering and information extraction. This paper is concerned with the specific problem of finding and ranking relations from a given Knowledge Graph (KG) that hold over the pairs of entities juxtaposed in a table or structured list. The current state-of-the-art for this task is to attempt to link the entities mentioned in the table cells to objects in the KG and rank the relations that hold for those linked objects. As a result, these methods are hampered by the incompleteness and uneven coverage in even the best knowledge graphs available today. The alternative described here relies on ranking relations using generative language models derived from Web-scale corpora instead of entity linking.  As such, it can produce high quality results even when the entities in the table are missing from the graph. The experimental validation, designed to expose the challenges posed by KG incompleteness, shows the proposed approach is robust and effective on a wide range of domains.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Roma Tre University", "University of Alberta", "Roma Tre University"], "authors": ["Matteo Cannaviccio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cannaviccio:Matteo", "Denilson Barbosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbosa:Denilson", "Paolo Merialdo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Merialdo:Paolo"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
