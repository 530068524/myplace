Due to the existence of uncertainty in many real-world data, answering reverse skyline queries accurately and efficiently over uncertain data has become increasingly important. In this paper, we model the  probabilistic reverse skyline  query on uncertain data, in both monochromatic and bichromatic cases, and propose effective pruning methods to reduce the search space of query processing. Moreover, efficient query procedures have been presented seamlessly integrating the proposed pruning methods. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach with various experimental settings.", "citation": "Citations (259)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Xiang Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Xiang", "Lei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0002:Lei"], "pages": 14}
