Packet scheduling and buffer management are jointly considered for scalable video transmission to adapt to the changing channel conditions. A proxy-based filtering algorithm among scalable layers is considered to maximize the decoded video quality at the receiver side while keeping a minimum playback margin. This problem is cast in the context of Markov Decision Processes which allows the design of foresighted policies maximizing some long-term reward. Experimental results illustrate the benefit of this approach compared to a shortterm policy in term of average PSNR improvement.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Bell Labs", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "authors": ["Nesrine Changuel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Changuel:Nesrine", "Nicholas Mastronarde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mastronarde:Nicholas", "Mihaela van der Schaar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaar:Mihaela_van_der", "Bessem Sayadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sayadi:Bessem", "Michel Kieffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kieffer:Michel"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
