However, relational databases do not natively support nested collections in query results. This can lead to major performance problems: if programmers write queries that yield nested results, then such systems typically either fail or generate a large number of queries. We present a new approach to query shredding, which converts a query returning nested data to a fixed number of SQL queries. Our approach, in contrast to prior work, handles multiset semantics, and generates an idiomatic SQL:1999 query directly from a normal form for nested queries. We provide a detailed description of our translation and present experiments showing that it offers comparable or better performance than a recent alternative approach on a range of examples.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["James Cheney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheney:James", "Sam Lindley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindley:Sam", "Philip Wadler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wadler:Philip"], "pages": 12}
