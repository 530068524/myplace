We use a novel experimental apparatus to manipulate these cues in a live Instant Message conversation. Results show a positive causal relationship of conversation duration and cue use on perceived affinity, and the relationship is contingent upon whether or not partners are able to see each other\u00e2  s cues. Further analysis of the dialogue reveals that reciprocity may play a central role in supporting this effect. We then demonstrate how one\u00e2  s cue use is influenced by a partner\u00e2  s cue use, and show that cues are often used in greeting and sign-off rituals.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Noah Liebman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liebman:Noah", "Darren Gergle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gergle:Darren"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
