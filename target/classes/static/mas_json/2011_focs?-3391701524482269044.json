In recent years, beginning in Kalai'01, much work has been done in finding \\text it{robust} versions of these theorems, showing that impossibility remains even when the constraints are \\text it{almost} always satisfied. In this work we present an Algebraic scheme for producing such results. We demonstrate it for a variant of Arrow's theorem, found in Dokow and Holzman [5].", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Dvir Falik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Falik:Dvir", "Ehud Friedgut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedgut:Ehud"], "pages": 10}
