{"title": "MoodLight: Exploring Personal and Social Implications of Ambient Display of Biosensor Data.", "fields": ["informatics", "biosensor", "personally identifiable information", "perception", "self discovery"], "abstract": "MoodLight is an interactive ambient lighting system that responds to biosensor input related to an individual's current level of arousal. Changes in levels of arousal correspond to fluctuations in the color of light provided by the system, altering the immediate environment in ways intimately related to the user's private internal state. We use this intervention to explore personal and social implications of the ambient display of biosensor data. A design probe study conducted with university students provided the opportunity to observe MoodLight being used by individuals and dyads. Discussion of findings highlights key tensions associated with the dialectics of technology-mediated self-awareness and automated disclosure of personal information, addressing issues of agency, skepticism and uncertainty. This study provides greater understanding of the ways in which the representations of personal informatics, with a focus on ambient feedback, influence our perceptions of ourselves and those around us.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Jaime Snyder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snyder:Jaime", "Mark Matthews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthews:Mark", "Jacqueline T.
