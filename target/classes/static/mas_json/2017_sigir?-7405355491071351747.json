{"title": "SogouT-16: A New Web Corpus to Embrace IR Research.", "fields": ["data web", "web intelligence", "web standards", "web development", "web modeling"], "abstract": "Web collection is essential for many Web based researches such as Web Information Retrieval (IR), Web data mining, Corpus linguistics and so on. However, it is usually expensive and time-consuming to collect a large scale of Web pages in lab-based environment and public-available collection becomes a necessity for these researches. In this study, we present a Chinese Web collection, SogouT-16, which is the largest free-of-charge public Chinese Web collection so far. We provide a variety of descriptive characteristics of SogouT-16 and discuss its adoption in a newly-designed ad-hoc retrieval task in NTCIR-13,  We Want Web . SogouT-16 also provides online retrieval service and contains a number of auxiliary resources including hyperlink structure graph, query logs, word embedding, and etc. We believe that SogouT-16 will provide new opportunities for novel investigations and applications in IR and other related communities.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Sogou Inc., Beijing, China", "Sogou Inc., Beijing, China"], "authors": ["Cheng Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Cheng", "Yukun Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yukun", "Yiqun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yiqun", "Xiaochuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaochuan", "Jingfang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jingfang", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Min", "Shaoping Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shaoping"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
