However, these models do little to shield developers from the difficult problems of parallelization, data decomposition and machine-specific details. Most programmersare having a difficult time using these programming models effectively. To provide a programming modelthat addresses the productivity and performance requirements for the average programmer, we explore a domainspecificapproach to heterogeneous parallel programming.   We propose language virtualization as a new principle that enables the construction of highly efficient parallel domain specific languages that are embedded in a common host language. We define criteria for language virtualization and present techniques to achieve them.We present two concrete case studies of domain-specific languages that are implemented using our virtualization approach.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Hassan Chafi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chafi:Hassan", "Zach DeVito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeVito:Zach", "Adriaan Moors.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moors:Adriaan", "Tiark Rompf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rompf:Tiark", "Arvind K.
