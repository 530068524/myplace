{"title": "Jumpstarting relationships with online games: evidence from a laboratory investigation.", "fields": ["video game design", "game mechanics", "online participation", "game developer", "emergent gameplay"], "abstract": "The popularity of online games, particularly casual games, has increased tremendously in recent years. Often these game experiences involve partner-based or multi-player interactions. Previous work has shown that computer-mediated interactions and online activities with a stranger have the potential to impact attitudes and liking for that person. Can experiences in online games have a similar impact? This paper presents results from two experiments suggesting that cooperative online game experiences (even without any direct communication interactions) can significantly impact liking for another person and perceptions of that person's characteristics. Implications for the design of online \"team-building\" style game experiences are briefly discussed.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Laura A.
