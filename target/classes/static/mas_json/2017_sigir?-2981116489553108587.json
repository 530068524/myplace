{"title": "Non-negative Matrix Factorization Meets Word Embedding.", "fields": ["information retrieval applications", "non negative matrix factorization", "document clustering", "word2vec", "word embedding"], "abstract": "Document clustering is central in modern information retrieval applications. Among existing models, non-negative-matrix factorization (NMF) approaches have proven effective for this task. However, NMF approaches, like other models in this context, exhibit a major drawback, namely they use the bag-of-word representation and, thus, do not account for the sequential order in which words occur in documents. This is an important issue since it may result in a significant loss of semantics. In this paper, we aim to address the above issue and propose a new model which successfully integrates a word embedding model, word2vec, into an NMF framework so as to leverage the semantic relationships between words. Empirical results, on several real-world datasets, demonstrate the benefits of our model in terms of text document clustering as well as document/word embedding.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Paris Descartes University", "Paris Descartes University", "Paris Descartes University"], "authors": ["Melissa Ailem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ailem:Melissa", "Aghiles Salah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salah:Aghiles", "Mohamed Nadif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nadif:Mohamed"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
