This problem has been previously addressed only for directed acyclic graphs. In this work we develop the theory required to solve this problem optimally for any type of graphs. We modify traditional heuristic search algorithms for this setting, and propose a novel bidirectional search algorithm that is specifically suited for TVS. The benefits of this bidirectional search algorithm are discussed both theoretically and experimentally on several domains.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Charles III University of Madrid", "Harvard University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Carlos Linares L\u00f3pez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=oacute=pez:Carlos_Linares", "Roni Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Roni", "Ariel Felner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felner:Ariel"], "pages": 7}
