{"title": "Reliability in Layered Networks with Random Link Failures.", "fields": ["logical topology", "approximation algorithm", "reliability", "network topology", "polynomial"], "abstract": "We consider network reliability in layered networks where the lower layer experiences random link failures. In layered networks, each failure at the lower layer may lead to multiple failures at the upper layer. We generalize the classical polynomial expression for network reliability to the multilayer setting. Using random sampling techniques, we develop polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the failure polynomial. Our approach gives an approximate expression for reliability as a function of the link failure probability, eliminating the need to resample for different values of the failure probability. Furthermore, it gives insight on how the routings of the logical topology on the physical topology impact network reliability. We show that maximizing the min cut of the (layered) network maximizes reliability in the low-failure-probability regime. Based on this observation, we develop algorithms for routing the logical topology to maximize reliability.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kayi Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kayi", "Hyang-Won Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hyang=Won", "Eytan Modiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Modiano:Eytan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
