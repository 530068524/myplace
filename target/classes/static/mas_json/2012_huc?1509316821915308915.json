{"title": "Design and implementation of a space model server for indoor location-based services.", "fields": ["implementation", "systems architecture", "type of service", "location based service", "schema"], "abstract": "This research investigates a space model server for indoor location-based services which require fine-grained spatial data. Functional and non-functional requirements for a space model server that supports such services are identified. A system architecture is proposed that scales well in terms of model size, query loads and types of services. The space model reuses a schema for network-based space layouts which supports high spatial resolution and efficient local queries. Properties of a query language used to extract partial models from the space model server are investigated. System implementation and validation are discussed.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Milos Sipetic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sipetic:Milos"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
