In contrast to recent learning based methods for 3D reconstruction, we leverage the underlying 3D geometry of the problem through feature projection and unprojection along viewing rays. By formulating these operations in a differentiable manner, we are able to learn the system end-to-end for the task of metric 3D reconstruction. End-to-end learning allows us to jointly reason about shape priors while conforming to geometric constraints, enabling reconstruction from much fewer images (even a single image) than required by classical approaches as well as completion of unseen surfaces. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on the ShapeNet dataset and demonstrate the benefits over classical approaches and recent learning based methods.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Google", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Abhishek Kar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kar:Abhishek", "Christian H\u00e4ne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=ne:Christian", "Jitendra Malik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malik:Jitendra"], "pages": 12}
