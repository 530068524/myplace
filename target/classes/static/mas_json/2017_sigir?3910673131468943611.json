However, online learning to rank has been used only in the monolingual setting where queries and documents are in the same language. In this work, we present the first empirical study of optimizing a model for Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) based on implicit feedback inferred from user interactions. We show that ranking models for CLIR with acceptable performance can be learned in an online setting although ranking features are noisy because of the language mismatch.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Georgetown University", "University of Tehran"], "authors": ["Razieh Rahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahimi:Razieh", "Azadeh Shakery.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shakery:Azadeh"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
