{"title": "TRIMMER: application specialization for code debloating.", "fields": ["gadget", "trimmer", "user requirements document", "software deployment", "code bloat"], "abstract": "With the proliferation of new hardware architectures and ever-evolving user requirements, the software stack is becoming increasingly bloated. In practice, only a limited subset of the supported functionality is utilized in a particular usage context, thereby presenting an opportunity to eliminate unused features. In the past, program specialization has been proposed as a mechanism for enabling automatic software debloating. In this work, we show how existing program specialization techniques lack the analyses required for providing code simplification for real-world programs. We present an approach that uses stronger analysis techniques to take advantage of constant configuration data, thereby enabling more effective debloating. We developed Trimmer, an application specialization tool that leverages user-provided configuration data to specialize an application to its deployment context. The specialization process attempts to eliminate the application functionality that is unused in the user-defined context. Our evaluation demonstrates Trimmer can effectively reduce code bloat. For 13 applications spanning various domains, we observe a mean binary size reduction of 21% and a maximum reduction of 75%. We also show specialization reduces the surface for code-reuse attacks by reducing the number of exploitable gadgets. For the evaluated programs, we observe a 20% mean reduction in the total gadget count and a maximum reduction of 87%.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Lahore University of Management Sciences", "SRI International", "Lahore University of Management Sciences"], "authors": ["Hashim Sharif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharif:Hashim", "Muhammad Abubakar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abubakar:Muhammad", "Ashish Gehani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehani:Ashish", "Fareed Zaffar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaffar:Fareed"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
