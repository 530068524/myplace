{"title": "Which to View: Personalized Prioritization for Broadcast Emails.", "fields": ["email authentication", "prioritization", "html email", "collaborative filtering", "email address harvesting"], "abstract": "Email is one of the most important communication tools today, but email overload resulting from the large number of unimportant or irrelevant emails is causing trillion-level economy loss every year. Thus personalized email prioritization algorithms are of urgent need. Despite lots of previous effort on this topic, broadcast email, an important type of email, is overlooked in previous literature. Broadcast emails are significantly different from normal emails, introducing both new challenges and opportunities. On one hand, lack of real senders and limited user interactions invalidate the key features exploited by traditional email prioritization algorithms; on the other hand, thousands of receivers for one broadcast email bring us the opportunity to predict importance through collaborative filtering. However, broadcast emails face a severe cold-start problem which hinders the direct application of collaborative filtering. In this paper, we propose the first framework for broadcast email prioritization by designing a novel active learning model that considers the collaborative filtering, implicit feedback and time sensitive responsiveness features of broadcast emails. Our method is thoroughly evaluated on a large scale real world industrial dataset from Samsung Electronics. Our method is proved highly effective and outperforms state-of-the-art personalized email prioritization methods.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Northwest University"], "authors": ["Beidou Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Beidou", "Martin Ester.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ester:Martin", "Jiajun Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Jiajun", "Yu Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yu", "Ziyu Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Ziyu", "Deng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Deng"], "conf": "www", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
