To make DPLC more efficient in terms of channel utilization, we incorporate a lightweight and accurate link estimation method that captures both physical channel conditions and interferences. We further provide two easy-to-use services, i.e., small message aggregation and large message fragmentation, to facilitate upper-layer application programming. The implementation of DPLC based on TinyOS 2.1 is lightweight, with respect to computation, memory, and header overhead. Our experiments using a real indoor testbed running CTP show that DPLC results in a 13% reduction in transmission overhead and a 41.8% reduction in energy consumption compared with the original protocol, and a 21% reduction in transmission overhead and a 15.1% reduction in energy consumption compared with simple aggregation schemes.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "McGill University", "Zhejiang University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Wei Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong_0001:Wei", "Xue Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Xue", "Chun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chun", "Yuan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0004:Yuan", "Gong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Gong", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao", "Jiajun Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Jiajun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
