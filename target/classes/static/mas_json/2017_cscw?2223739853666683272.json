{"title": "CollaDroid: Automatic Augmentation of Android Application with Lightweight Interactive Collaboration.", "fields": ["program transformation", "android", "mobile collaboration", "synchronizing", "latency"], "abstract": "Collaborative work supported by mobile applications has become more and more popular. Mobile collaboration in some cases needs to be conducted in an interactive way to allow the sharing of the requester screen with the collaborator. Existing interactive screen sharing techniques, however, may cause heavy network traffic and high latency and lack fine-grained control of the scope of collaboration. In this paper, we propose CollaDroid, a lightweight and UI Description based technique for interactive collaboration of Android applications. CollaDroid can automatically transform an Android application to a collaboration augmented application with which a requester can interactively collaborate with a remote collaborator by synchronizing UI (User Interface) content and events. The results of our experimental study show that CollaDroid is applicable for a large part of applications in the Android Market and can provide an efficient collaboration mechanism with low network traffic and latency. And the results of our user study show that the collaboration mechanism implemented by CollaDroid is well accepted by users.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Jiahuan Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Jiahuan", "Xin Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Xin", "Jiacheng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jiacheng", "Huaqian Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Huaqian", "Gang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0001:Gang", "Ying Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0012:Ying", "Wenyun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wenyun"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
