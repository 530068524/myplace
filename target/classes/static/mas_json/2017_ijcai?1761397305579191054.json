Unfortunately, most species distribution models only target a single species at a time, despite the fact that there is strong evidence that species are not independently distributed. We propose Deep Multi-Species Embedding (DMSE), which jointly embed vectors corresponding to multiple species as well as vectors representing environmental covariates into a common high dimensional feature space via a deep neural network. Applied to \\textit{eBird} bird watching data, our single-species DMSE model outperforms commonly used random forest models in terms of accuracy. Our multi-species DMSE model further improves the single species version. Through this model, we are able to confirm quantitatively many species-species interactions, which are only understood qualitatively among ecologists. As an additional contribution, we provide a graphical embedding of hundreds of bird species in the Northeast US.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Di Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Di", "Yexiang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Yexiang", "Daniel Fink.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fink:Daniel", "Shuo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shuo", "Carla P.
