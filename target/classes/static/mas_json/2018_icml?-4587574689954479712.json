{"title": "Learning Independent Causal Mechanisms.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "generative grammar", "causality", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Independent causal mechanisms are a central concept in the study of causality with implications for machine learning tasks. In this work we develop an algorithm to recover a set of (inverse) independent mechanisms relating a distribution transformed by the mechanisms to a reference distribution. The approach is fully unsupervised and based on a set of experts that compete for data to specialize and extract the mechanisms. We test and analyze the proposed method on a series of experiments based on image transformations. Each expert successfully maps a subset of the transformed data to the original domain, and the learned mechanisms generalize to other domains. We discuss implications for domain transfer and links to recent trends in generative modeling.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Cambridge/MPI", "MPI T\u00fcbingen"], "authors": ["Giambattista Parascandolo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parascandolo:Giambattista", "Niki Kilbertus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kilbertus:Niki", "Mateo Rojas-Carulla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rojas=Carulla:Mateo", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
