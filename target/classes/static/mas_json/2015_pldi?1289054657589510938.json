We present a programming-by-example framework called Parsify that is able to synthesize a parser from input/output examples. The user does not write a single line of code. To achieve this, Parsify provides: (a) an iterative algorithm for synthesizing and refining a grammar one example at a time, (b) an interface that provides immediate visual feedback in response to changes in the grammar being refined, and (c) a graphical mechanism for specifying example parse trees using only textual selections. We empirically demonstrate the viability of our approach by using Parsify to construct parsers for source code drawn from Verilog, SQL, Apache, and Tiger.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Alan Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Alan", "John Sarracino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarracino:John", "Sorin Lerner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerner:Sorin"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
