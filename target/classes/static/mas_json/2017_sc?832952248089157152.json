{"title": "Deep learning at 15PF: supervised and semi-supervised classification for scientific data.", "fields": ["deep learning", "machine learning", "architecture", "asynchronous communication", "quality of service"], "abstract": "This paper presents the first, 15-PetaFLOP Deep Learning system for solving scientific pattern classification problems on contemporary HPC architectures. We develop supervised convolutional architectures for discriminating signals in high-energy physics data as well as semi-supervised architectures for localizing and classifying extreme weather in climate data. Our Intelcaffe-based implementation obtains ~2TFLOP/s on a single Cori Phase-II Xeon-Phi node. We use a hybrid strategy employing synchronous node-groups, while using asynchronous communication across groups. We use this strategy to scale training of a single model to ~9600 Xeon-Phi nodes; obtaining peak performance of 11.73-15.07 PFLOP/s and sustained performance of 11.41-13.27 PFLOP/s. At scale, our HEP architecture produces state-of-the-art classification accuracy on a dataset with 10M images, exceeding that achieved by selections on high-level physics-motivated features. Our semi-supervised architecture successfully extracts weather patterns in a 15TB climate dataset. Our results demonstrate that Deep Learning can be optimized and scaled effectively on many-core, HPC systems.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Intel", "Stanford University", "NERSC", "NERSC"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Thorsten Kurth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurth:Thorsten", "Jian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jian", "Nadathur Satish.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satish:Nadathur", "Evan Racah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Racah:Evan", "Ioannis Mitliagkas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitliagkas:Ioannis", "Md.
