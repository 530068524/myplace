{"title": "Detecting and sketching the common.", "fields": ["object detection", "sketch", "clutter", "pixel", "binary number"], "abstract": "Given very few images containing a common object of interest under severe variations in appearance, we detect the common object and provide a compact visual representation of that object, depicted by a binary sketch. Our algorithm is composed of two stages: (i) Detect a mutually common (yet non-trivial) ensemble of \u2018self-similarity descriptors\u2019 shared by all the input images. (ii) Having found such a mutually common ensemble, \u2018invert\u2019 it to generate a compact sketch which best represents this ensemble. This provides a simple and compact visual representation of the common object, while eliminating the background clutter of the query images. It can be obtained from very few query images. Such clean sketches may be useful for detection, retrieval, recognition, co-segmentation, and for artistic graphical purposes.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shai Bagon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagon:Shai", "Or Brostovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brostovski:Or", "Meirav Galun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galun:Meirav", "Michal Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Michal"], "pages": 8}
