However, heterogeneity in switch hardware, especially in forwarding pipeline architecture, renders the task of network application developers and network administrators tedious, by hampering portability across switch models. In this paper, we propose FlowConvertor, an algorithm capable of converting rules from any forwarding pipeline to any other different forwarding pipeline, as long as both pipelines offer compatible operations. More precisely, FlowConvertor is an online algorithm that operates on flow updates issued to the origin pipeline and computes the corresponding updates for the target pipeline in real time. Performance evaluation shows that the latency introduced by FlowConvertor on the path between the SDN controller and the target switch is of the order of 1ms in most cases, and is thus acceptable for practical deployment.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "University of Li\u00e8ge"], "authors": ["Heng Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Heng", "Gaogang Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Gaogang", "Zhenyu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Zhenyu", "Peng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0003:Peng", "Laurent Mathy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mathy:Laurent"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
