{"title": "Efficient segmentation using feature-based graph partitioning active contours.", "fields": ["graph partition", "active contour model", "pixel", "scalability", "continuous optimization"], "abstract": "Graph partitioning active contours (GPAC) is a recently introduced approach that elegantly embeds the graph-based image segmentation problem within a continuous optimization framework. GPAC can be used within parametric snake-based or implicit level set-based active contour continuous paradigms for image partitioning. However, GPAC similar to many other graph-based approaches has quadratic memory requirements which severely limits the scalability of the algorithm to practical problem domains. An N\u00d7N image requires O(N 4 ) computation and memory to create and store the full graph of pixel inter-relationships even before the start of the contour optimization process. For example, an 1024\u00d71024 grayscale image needs over one terabyte of memory. Approximations using tile/block-based or superpixel-based multiscale grouping of the pixels reduces this complexity by trading off accuracy. This paper describes a new algorithm that implements the exact GPAC algorithm using a constant memory requirement of a few kilobytes, independent of image size.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Missouri", "University of Missouri"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Filiz Bunyak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bunyak:Filiz", "Kannappan Palaniappan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palaniappan:Kannappan"], "pages": 8}
