MPCA employees multiple linear subspaces constructed by varying factors. In this paper, we propose nonlinear submanifold analysis, which can represent the variation of each factor more accurately than the conventional multilinear subspace analysis. Based on submani-fold learning, we propose an extension of the multiple factor analysis. This paper proposes the kernel-based extension of MPCA whose definition of a kernel function and neighbors of each sample is robust for submanifold learning. The experimental results in this paper demonstrate that the proposed methods produce a synergetic advantage for face recognition. This is because our method offers the combined virtues of both multifactor analysis and manifold learning.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sung Won Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Sung_Won", "Marios Savvides.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savvides:Marios"], "pages": 8}
