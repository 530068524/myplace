{"title": "Scalable parallel minimum spanning forest computation.", "fields": ["parallel algorithm", "exploit", "tree", "cuda", "scalability"], "abstract": "The proliferation of data in graph form calls for the development of scalable graph algorithms that exploit parallel processing environments. One such problem is the computation of a graph's minimum spanning forest (MSF). Past research has proposed several parallel algorithms for this problem, yet none of them scales to large, high-density graphs. In this paper we propose a novel, scalable, parallel MSF algorithm for undirected weighted graphs. Our algorithm leverages Prim's algorithm in a parallel fashion, concurrently expanding several subsets of the computed MSF. Our effort focuses on minimizing the communication among different processors without constraining the local growth of a processor's computed subtree. In effect, we achieve a scalability that previous approaches lacked. We implement our algorithm in CUDA, running on a GPU and study its performance using real and synthetic, sparse as well as dense, structured and unstructured graph data. Our experimental study demonstrates that our algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art GPU-based MSF algorithm, while being several orders of magnitude faster than sequential CPU-based algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Rutgers University", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Sadegh Nobari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nobari:Sadegh", "Thanh-Tung Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Thanh=Tung", "Panagiotis Karras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karras:Panagiotis", "St\u00e9phane Bressan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bressan:St=eacute=phane"], "pages": 10}
