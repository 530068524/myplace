Logical AI has focused mainly on the former, and statistical AI on the latter. Markov logic combines the two by attaching weights to first-order formulas and viewing them as templates for features of Markov networks. Inference algorithms for Markov logic draw on ideas from satisfiability, Markov chain Monte Carlo and knowledge-based model construction. Learning algorithms are based on the voted perceptron, pseudo-likelihood and inductive logic programming. Markov logic has been successfully applied to problems in entity resolution, link prediction, information extraction and others, and is the basis of the open-source Alchemy system.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Oregon", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Google", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Pedro M.
