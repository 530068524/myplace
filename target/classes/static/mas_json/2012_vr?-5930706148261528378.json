We collected route data and acceleration data of Hayashibutai, the performance stage of the Yamahoko float, with a GPS logger and acceleration sensors during the parade. We adopted the data to reproduce the vibration using a vibration platform and integrated vibration, sound, and 3D screen to build an experimental system. The analysis of the reproduced acceleration data and the original acceleration data showed that the virtual experiencing system reproduced the vibration of the Hayashibutai. We also received positive feedbacks from the experts participated in our experiment.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Gunma National  ... e of Technology"], "authors": ["Liang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0002:Liang", "Woong Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Woong", "Yuichiro Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hara:Yuichiro", "Kazuyuki Izuno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Izuno:Kazuyuki", "Keiji Yano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yano:Keiji", "Kozaburo Hachimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hachimura:Kozaburo"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
