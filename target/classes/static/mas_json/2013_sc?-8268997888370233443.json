In this paper, we describe how to extend system-wide, sampling-based performance analysis methods to GPU-accelerated systems. Since current GPUs do not support sampling, our implementation required careful coordination of instrumentation-based performance data collection on GPUs with sampling-based methods employed on CPUs. In addition, we also introduce a novel technique for analyzing systemic idleness in CPU/GPU systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques with application case studies on Titan and Keeneland. Some of the highlights of our case studies are: 1) we improved performance for LULESH 1.0 by 30%, 2) we identified a hardware performance problem on Keeneland, 3) we identified a scaling problem in LAMMPS derived from CUDA initialization, and 4) we identified a performance problem that is caused by GPU synchronization operations that suffer delays due to blocking system calls.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Milind Chabbi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chabbi:Milind", "Karthik Murthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murthy:Karthik", "Michael W.
