T&S is a third-party Facebook application, designed to support a flexible and controlled sharing of user data. It makes users able to upload resources (i.e., any file) and specify for each of them which users have to be authorized by T&S to access them. To enforce this controlled information sharing, T&S relies on the OSN access control model proposed in \\cite{tissec}, where social network relationships have an enhanced semantics than the contacts in Facebook. According to \\cite{tissec}, OSN users associate with each of their contacts a {\\em type}, representing the nature of the relationship (e.g., friends, colleagues, parents). Moreover, the creator of the relationship can assign to it also a trust level to represent the strength of the connection. This graph enables users to specify more expressive rules for the controlled information sharing. Indeed, on top of this enhanced social graph, T\\&S users can specify access constraints on the type, trust level and depth of the relationship it must exist with a given Facebook contact in order to access a certain resource.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Insubria", "University of Insubria", "University of Insubria"], "authors": ["Barbara Carminati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carminati:Barbara", "Elena Ferrari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferrari:Elena", "Jacopo Girardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Girardi:Jacopo"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
