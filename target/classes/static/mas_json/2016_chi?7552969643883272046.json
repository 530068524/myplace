But creating even simple apps is difficult. Why? In this paper, guided by Cognitive Dimensions, we explore the design space for relevant programming notations and supporting tools, and we pinpoint what we hypothesize to be specific obstacles in the creation of cloud-mobile-web apps. Among these is the prevalence of hidden dependencies within code of apps. Based on this analysis, we propose a new notation called LondonTube aimed at making these hidden dependencies visible, thereby helping health scientists to create apps for themselves. A study showed that LondonTube reduced the time to create a cloud-mobile-web app by a factor of over 20, and it reduced questions about hidden dependencies.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "National Instruments", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christopher Scaffidi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scaffidi:Christopher", "Andrew Dove.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dove:Andrew", "Tahmid Nabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nabi:Tahmid"], "pages": 11}
