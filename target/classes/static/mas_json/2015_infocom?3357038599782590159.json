A key distinctive requirement of TVWS networks is the power asymmetry \u2014 the static APs are allowed to transmit at up to 4 W, while the mobile clients in vehicles are limited to only 100 mW. Our measurements reveal that the power asymmetry not only causes severe uplink blackouts but also poses significant coexistence problems, as high-power fixed nodes can easily starve the low-power mobile ones due to carrier sensing loss. To tackle these unique challenges, we propose a cross-layer design of a Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) based system. We employ an adaptive DSSS mechanism that strategically configures the spreading code, so as to boost uplink coverage while maximizing throughput. We further design a traffic-aware code assignment algorithm for uplink packets to balance the requirement of throughput-intensive and latency-sensitive flows. We have implemented the design on a TVWS software-radio platform on a moving vehicle in an urban environment, and demonstrated that link asymmetry can be completely removed to support realistic application traffic, while the carrier sense loss rate at fixed nodes can be reduced by around 85%.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Sanjib Sur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sur:Sanjib", "Xinyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xinyu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
