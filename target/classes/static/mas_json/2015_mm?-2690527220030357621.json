Our method employs colour and appearance information to drive the reconstruction process subject to the material properties of the objects in the scene. The idea is to reconstruct the image spectral irradiance making use of a set of prototypes extracted from the training set. These spectra, together with a set of convolutional features are hence obtained using sparse coding so as to reconstruct the image irradiance. With the reconstructed spectra in hand, we proceed to compute the illuminant power spectrum using a quadratic optimisation approach. We provide a quantitative analysis for our method and compare to a number of alternatives. We also show sample results on illuminant substitution and transfer, film simulation and image recolouring using mood board colour schemes.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["NICTA"], "authors": ["Antonio Robles-Kelly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robles=Kelly:Antonio"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
