{"title": "Capacity Scaling of Wireless Networks with Inhomogeneous Node Density: Lower Bounds.", "fields": ["attenuation", "scaling", "subnetwork connection protection", "throughput", "wireless network", "cluster analysis", "network topology"], "abstract": "We consider static ad hoc wireless networks comprising significant inhomogeneities in the node spatial distribution over the area and analyze the scaling laws of their transport capacity as the number of nodes increases. In particular, we consider nodes placed according to a shot-noise Cox process (SNCP), which allows to model the clustering behavior usually recognized in large-scale systems. For this class of networks, we propose novel scheduling and routing schemes that approach previously computed upper bounds to the per-flow throughput as the number of nodes tends to infinity.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "University of Turin", "Dipt. di Elettr ... i Torino, Turin", "Dipt. di Elettr ... i Torino, Turin"], "authors": ["Giuseppa Alfano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alfano:Giuseppa", "Michele Garetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garetto:Michele", "Emilio Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Emilio"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
