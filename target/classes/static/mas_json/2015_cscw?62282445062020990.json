{"title": "Social Sharing of Emotions on Facebook: Channel Differences, Satisfaction, and Replies.", "fields": ["social media", "social sharing of emotions", "psychology", "channel", "social psychology"], "abstract": "People often share emotions with others in order to manage their emotional experiences. We investigate how social media properties such as visibility and directedness affect how people share emotions in Facebook, and their satisfaction after doing so. 141 participants rated 1,628 of their own recent status updates, posts they made on others' timelines, and private messages they sent for intensity, valence, personal relevance, and overall satisfaction felt after sharing each message. For network-visible channels-status updates and posts on others' timelines-they also rated their satisfaction with replies they received. People shared differently between channels, with more intense and negative emotions in private messages. People felt more satisfied after sharing more positive emotions in all channels and after sharing more personally relevant emotions in network-visible channels. Finally, people's overall satisfaction after sharing emotions in network-visible channels is strongly tied to their reply satisfaction. Quality of replies, not just quantity, matters, suggesting the need for designs that help people receive valuable responses to their shared emotions.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Google", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Natalya N.
