{"title": "Generating private synthetic databases for untrusted system evaluation.", "fields": ["database design", "differential privacy", "synthetic data", "information privacy", "privacy software"], "abstract": "Evaluating the performance of database systems is crucial when database vendors or researchers are developing new technologies. But such evaluation tasks rely heavily on actual data and query workloads that are often unavailable to researchers due to privacy restrictions. To overcome this barrier, we propose a framework for the release of a synthetic database which accurately models selected performance properties of the original database. We improve on prior work on synthetic database generation by providing a formal, rigorous guarantee of privacy. Accuracy is achieved by generating synthetic data using a carefully selected set of statistical properties of the original data which balance privacy loss with relevance to the given query workload. An important contribution of our framework is an extension of standard differential privacy to multiple tables.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Wentian Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Wentian", "Gerome Miklau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miklau:Gerome", "Vani Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Vani"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
