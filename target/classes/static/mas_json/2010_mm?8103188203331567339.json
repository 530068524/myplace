We include a system called \"FakeSpace\" to imitate 3D environment, and a PHAMTOM device to simulate touching forces. Movements of 3D deformable models are simulated based on a spectral method, and forces are simulated as spring forces. We are able to real-time update both visual and haptic feedbacks, so that to provide a more realistic user interaction. In addition, with the help of stereoscopic display, we can present an immersive 3D experience. This video illustrates the settings of our environment and demonstrates how users real-time manipulate 3D models in this immersive system using some interactive examples. Our system is reconfigurable and is useful for different applications in the fields of education, entertainment, medical simulation and so on.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Ziying Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Ziying", "Anant Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Anant", "Xiaohu Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Xiaohu", "Balakrishnan Prabhakaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakaran:Balakrishnan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
