{"title": "Blessing of Dimensionality: High-Dimensional Feature and Its Efficient Compression for Face Verification.", "fields": ["sparse approximation", "projection method", "local binary patterns", "feature", "curse of dimensionality"], "abstract": "Making a high-dimensional (e.g., 100K-dim) feature for face recognition seems not a good idea because it will bring difficulties on consequent training, computation, and storage. This prevents further exploration of the use of a high dimensional feature. In this paper, we study the performance of a high dimensional feature. We first empirically show that high dimensionality is critical to high performance. A 100K-dim feature, based on a single-type Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptor, can achieve significant improvements over both its low-dimensional version and the state-of-the-art. We also make the high-dimensional feature practical. With our proposed sparse projection method, named rotated sparse regression, both computation and model storage can be reduced by over 100 times without sacrificing accuracy quality.", "citation": "Citations (508)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0003:Dong", "Xudong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xudong", "Fang Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Fang", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian"], "pages": 8}
