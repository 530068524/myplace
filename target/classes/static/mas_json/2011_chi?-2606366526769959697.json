In this paper we report on a 2-year project in which we have iteratively designed, developed and tested a knowledge discovery system (KnowDis) for organizations. Early stages of our study revealed that, employees do not know what is available on the corporate intranet, or files and messages they have stored. KnowDis proactively fetches relevant information and displays it in an unobtrusive form; this increases employee awareness without disrupting their tasks. We discuss and characterize knowledge workers' email usage behavior. Our main study with 28 users of KnowDis-enhanced email showed it can improve the user experience and performance on information retrieval tasks for knowledge workers.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "CA Technologies", "CA Technologies"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sven Laqua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laqua:Sven", "Martina Angela Sasse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sasse:Martina_Angela", "Steven Greenspan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenspan:Steven", "Carrie Gates.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gates:Carrie"], "pages": 10}
