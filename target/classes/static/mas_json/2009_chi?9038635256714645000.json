SLAP Widgets are cast from silicone or made of acrylic, and include sliders, knobs, keyboards, and buttons. They add tactile feedback to multi-touch tables, improving input accuracy. Using rear projection, SLAP Widgets can be relabeled dynamically, providing inexpensive, battery-free, and untethered augmentations. Furthermore, SLAP combines the flexibility of virtual objects with physical affordances. We evaluate how SLAP Widgets influence the user experience on tabletops compared to virtual controls. Empirical studies show that SLAPWidgets are easy to use and outperform virtual controls significantly in terms of accuracy and overall interaction time.", "citation": "Citations (231)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Malte Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:Malte", "Julie Wagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagner:Julie", "Yvonne Jansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jansen:Yvonne", "Roger Jennings.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jennings:Roger", "Ramsin Khoshabeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khoshabeh:Ramsin", "James D.
