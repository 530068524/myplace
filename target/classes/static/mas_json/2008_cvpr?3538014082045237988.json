{"title": "Variable baseline/resolution stereo.", "fields": ["triangulation", "pyramid", "stereo camera", "computer stereo vision", "stereo cameras"], "abstract": "We present a novel multi-baseline, multi-resolution stereo method, which varies the baseline and resolution proportionally to depth to obtain a reconstruction in which the depth error is constant. This is in contrast to traditional stereo, in which the error grows quadratically with depth, which means that the accuracy in the near range far exceeds that of the far range. This accuracy in the near range is unnecessarily high and comes at significant computational cost. It is, however, non-trivial to reduce this without also reducing the accuracy in the far range. Many datasets, such as video captured from a moving camera, allow the baseline to be selected with significant flexibility. By selecting an appropriate baseline and resolution (realized using an image pyramid), our algorithm computes a depthmap which has these properties: 1) the depth accuracy is constant over the reconstructed volume, 2) the computational effort is spread evenly over the volume, 3) the angle of triangulation is held constant w.r.t. depth. Our approach achieves a given target accuracy with minimal computational effort, and is orders of magnitude faster than traditional stereo.", "citation": "Citations (170)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["David Gallup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gallup:David", "Jan-Michael Frahm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frahm:Jan=Michael", "Philippos Mordohai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mordohai:Philippos", "Marc Pollefeys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pollefeys:Marc"], "pages": -1}
