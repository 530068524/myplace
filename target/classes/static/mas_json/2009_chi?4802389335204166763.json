Recent developments in this field raises the possibility of e-textile construction kits for hobbyists and novices alike. The unique nature of wearable computing and e-textiles also gives it a lot of potential as an educational computing topic, as it allows students to exercise their creativity and imagination while learning about computing and technology.   However, there are numerous difficulties involved in deploying existing technology in an educational environment. Current state of the art technology and techniques are not yet robust or reliable enough to stand up to the demands of educational computing, and they require a high level of skill from the user. In this paper, we present the TeeBoard, a constructive platform for e-textiles and wearable computing that is designed specifically to \"lower the floor\" for the integration of e-textiles into educational computing.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Grace Ngai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ngai:Grace", "Stephen C.
