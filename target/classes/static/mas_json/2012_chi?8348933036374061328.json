In contrast to most tiled-display systems, the only requirement for participation is for devices to have an internet connection and a web browser. Thus, most smartphones, tablets, laptops and similar devices can be used.  Phone as a Pixel  uses a color-transition encoding scheme to identify and locate displays. This approach has several advantages: devices can be arbitrarily arranged (i.e., not in a grid) and infrastructure consists of a single conventional camera. Further, additional devices can join at any time without re-calibration. These are desirable properties to enable collective displays in contexts like sporting events, concerts and political rallies. In this paper we describe our system, show results from proof-of-concept setups, and quantify the performance of our approach on hundreds of displays.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Julia Schwarz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwarz:Julia", "David Klionsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klionsky:David", "Chris Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Chris", "Paul Dietz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dietz:Paul", "Andrew Wilson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilson:Andrew"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
