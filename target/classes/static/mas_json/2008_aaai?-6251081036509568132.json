However, the local learning methods developed so far are all devised for single-view problems. In fact, in many real-world applications, examples are represented by multiple sets of features. In this paper, we extend the idea of local learning to multi-view problem, design a multi-view local model for each example, and propose a Multi-View Local Learning Regularization (MVLL-Reg) matrix. Both its linear and kernel version are given. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several state-of-theart ones.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Florida International University"], "authors": ["Dan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Dan", "Fei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Fei", "Changshui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Changshui", "Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Tao"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
