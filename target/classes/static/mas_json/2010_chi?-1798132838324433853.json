{"title": "Here's what i did: sharing and reusing web activity with ActionShot.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "scripting language", "multimedia", "reuse", "social network"], "abstract": "ActionShot is an integrated web browser tool that creates a fine-grained history of users' browsing activities by continually recording their browsing actions at the level of interactions, such as button clicks and entries into form fields. ActionShot provides interfaces to facilitate browsing and searching through this history, sharing portions of the history through established social networking tools such as Facebook, and creating scripts that can be used to repeat previous interactions at a later time. ActionShot can also create short textual summaries for sequences of interactions. In this paper, we describe the ActionShot and our initial explorations of the tool through field deployments within our organization and a lab study. Overall, we found that ActionShot's history features provide value beyond typical browser history interfaces.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Ian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ian", "Jeffrey Nichols.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nichols:Jeffrey", "Tessa A.
