{"title": "Probabilistic Distance-Based Arbitration: Providing Equality of Service for Many-Core CMPs.", "fields": ["arbitration", "latency", "differentiated service", "arbiter", "point to point", "virtual channel", "probabilistic logic"], "abstract": "Emerging many-core chip multiprocessors will integrate dozens of small processing cores with an on-chip interconnect consisting of point-to-point links. The interconnect enables the processing cores to not only communicate, but to share common resources such as main memory resources and I/O controllers. In this work, we propose an arbitration scheme to enable equality of service (EoS) in access to a chip\u2019s shared resources. That is, we seek to remove any bias in a core\u2019s access to a shared resource based on its location in the CMP. We propose using probabilistic arbitration combined with distance-based weights to achieve EoS and overcome the limitation of conventional round-robin arbiter. We describe how nonlinear weights need to be used with probabilistic arbiters and propose three different arbitration weight metrics \u2013 fixed weight, constantly increasing weight, and variably increasing weight. By only modifying the arbitration of an on-chip router, we do not require any additional buffers or virtual channels and create a simple, low-cost mechanism for achieving EoS. We evaluate our arbitration scheme across a wide range of traffic patterns. In addition to providing EoS, the proposed arbitration has additional benefits which include providing quality-of-service features (such as differentiated service) and providing fairness in terms of both throughput and latency that approaches the global fairness achieved with age-base arbitration \u2013 thus, providing a more stable network by achieving high sustained throughput beyond saturation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "Cray", "Google", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Michael Mihn-Jong Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Michael_Mihn=Jong", "John Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:John", "Dennis Abts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abts:Dennis", "Michael R.
