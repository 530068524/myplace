While designing new manifold learning algorithms has attracted much research attention, fewer research efforts have been focused on out-of-sample extrapolation of learned manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm of manifold learning. The proposed algorithm, namely Local and Global Regressive Mapping (LGRM), employs local regression models to grasp the manifold structure. We additionally impose a global regression term as regularization to learn a model for out-of-sample data extrapolation. Based on the algorithm, we propose a new manifold learning framework. Our framework can be applied to any manifold learning algorithms to simultaneously learn the low dimensional embedding of the training data and a model which provides explicit mapping of the out-of-sample data to the learned manifold. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework uncover the manifold structure precisely and can be freely applied to unseen data.", "citation": "Citations (44)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "University of Texas at Arlington", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Yi", "Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Shiming Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Shiming", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting", "Wenhua Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wenhua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
