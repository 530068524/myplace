We present Arco, a new solver that, given a dynamical system specification in the form of a set of differential equations, generates physically realizable configurations for programmable analog devices that are algebraically equivalent to the specified system. On a set of benchmarks from the biological domain, Arco generates configurations with 35 to 534 connections and 28 to 326 components in 1 to 54 minutes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sara Achour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achour:Sara", "Rahul Sarpeshkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarpeshkar:Rahul", "Martin C.
