{"title": "Frugal Coordinate Descent for Large-Scale NNLS.", "fields": ["coordinate descent", "radiation", "least squares", "computation", "solver"], "abstract": "The Nonnegative Least Squares (NNLS) formulation arises in many important regression problems. We present a novel coordinate descent method which differs from previous approaches in that we do not explicitly maintain complete gradient information. Empirical evidence shows that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art NNLS solver in computation time for calculating radiation dosage for cancer treatment problems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of New Mexico"], "authors": ["Vamsi K.
