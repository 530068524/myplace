{"title": "The Bethe Partition Function of Log-supermodular Graphical Models.", "fields": ["conjecture", "binary number", "pairwise comparison", "graphical model", "belief propagation"], "abstract": "Sudderth, Wainwright, and Willsky conjectured that the Bethe approximation corresponding to any fixed point of the belief propagation algorithm over an attractive, pairwise binary graphical model provides a lower bound on the true partition function. In this work, we resolve this conjecture in the affirmative by demonstrating that, for any graphical model with binary variables whose potential functions (not necessarily pairwise) are all log-supermodular, the Bethe partition function always lower bounds the true partition function. The proof of this result follows from a new variant of the \u201cfour functions\u201d theorem that may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Nicholas Ruozzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruozzi:Nicholas"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
