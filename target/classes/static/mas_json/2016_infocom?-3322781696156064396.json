Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) composed of various tiers of cells can attain energy savings thanks to the lower operational and transmit power consumptions of small cells. To address the inter-cell interference problem yet achieving network energy conservation, multicell cooperation facilitating cooperative transmission (also known as coordinated multipoint or CoMP) and sleep mode operation paves a way toward future green HetNets. To further alleviate the induced backhaul energy consumption caused by cooperative transmission, content caching which proactively caches popular files at local storages is regarded as a viable solution. In this paper, we investigate how energy-aware multicell cooperation in HetNets with content caching (ENCORE) can be achieved. On proving that the ENCORE problem is decomposable into two sub-problems, we claim that the place-then-transmit strategy is optimal to the ENCORE problem. Then, we design algorithms for the sub-problems and prove that the total energy consumption achieved by the proposed solution is upper-bounded. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms various dynamic clustering approaches in terms of energy savings, and show the impacts of content popularity and cache size on the backhaul energy consumption.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Yi-Han Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang:Yi=Han", "Wanjiun Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Wanjiun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
