It explores how the roles and responsibilities are allocated within a household to support these domestic routines. This paper reports a qualitative study of usage practices surrounding safety and security. It classifies three primary approaches to computer security in the home, and discusses how technical skill, household structure and gender relate to the approach selected, and discuss the transitory nature of such arrangements.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University College London"], "authors": ["Jennifer A.
