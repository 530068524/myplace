By snapping a picture of a product with a camera-phone, the user can retrieve online information of the product. The product is recognized by an image-based retrieval system located on a remote server. Our database currently comprises more than one million entries, primarily products packaged in rigid boxes with printed labels, such as CDs, DVDs, and books. We extract low bit-rate descriptors from the query image and compress the location of the descriptors using location histogram coding on the camera-phone. We transmit the compressed query features, instead of a query image, to reduce the transmission delay. We use inverted index compression and fast geometric re-ranking on our database to provide a low delay image recognition response for large scale databases. Experimental timing results on different parts of the mobile product recognition system is reported in this work.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Sam S.
