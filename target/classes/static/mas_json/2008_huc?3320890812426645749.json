We have collected a large continuous acceleration dataset from eight experimental subjects going about their normal daily routine for 3 days each. Each subject is instrumented with a data collection apparatus that simultaneously logs 3-axis, 80Hz acceleration data from six body locations. We use this dataset to optimize a first-principles physical model of the commonly used velocity damped resonant generator (VDRG) by selecting physical parameters such as resonant frequency and damping coefficient to maximize harvested power. Our results show that with reasonable assumptions on size, mass, placement, and efficiency of VDRG harvesters, most body-mounted wireless sensors and even some consumer electronics devices, may be powered continuously and indefinitely from everyday motion.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Washington", "Duke University", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jaeseok Yun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yun:Jaeseok", "Shwetak N.
