This extremely challenging combinatorial problem requires determining the number of sites in the protein and the set of residues involved in each of them. We formulate it as a distance-based supervised clustering task, where training proteins are employed to learn a proper distance function between residues. A partial clustering is then returned by searching for maximum-weight cliques in the resulting weighted graph representation of proteins. A novel stochastic local search algorithm is proposed to efficiently generate approximate solutions. Our method achieves substantial improvements over a previous structured-output approach for metal binding site prediction. Significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art are also achieved in predicting catalytic sites from 3D structure in enzymes.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento", "University of Trento", "University of Trento"], "authors": ["Franco Mascia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mascia:Franco", "Elisa Cilia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cilia:Elisa", "Mauro Brunato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brunato:Mauro", "Andrea Passerini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Passerini:Andrea"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
