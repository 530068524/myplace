Many important retrieval and mining tasks rely on ranking the data items based on their centrality or prestige in the network. Beyond prestige, diversity has been recognized as a crucial objective in ranking, aiming at providing a non-redundant and high coverage piece of information in the top ranked results. Nevertheless, existing network-based ranking approaches either disregard the concern of diversity, or handle it with non-optimized heuristics, usually based on greedy vertex selection.   We propose a novel ranking algorithm, DivRank, based on a reinforced random walk in an information network. This model automatically balances the prestige and the diversity of the top ranked vertices in a principled way. DivRank not only has a clear optimization explanation, but also well connects to classical models in mathematics and network science. We evaluate DivRank using empirical experiments on three different networks as well as a text summarization task. DivRank outperforms existing network-based ranking methods in terms of enhancing diversity in prestige.", "citation": "Citations (161)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Qiaozhu Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Qiaozhu", "Jian Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo_0002:Jian", "Dragomir R.
