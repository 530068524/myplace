{"title": "Flow Permissions for Android.", "fields": ["phone", "android", "flow", "call graph", "permission"], "abstract": "This paper proposes Flow Permissions, an extension to the Android permission mechanism. Unlike the existing permission mechanism our permission mechanism contains semantic information based on information flows. Flow Permissions allow users to examine and grant explicit information flows within an application (e.g., a permission for reading the phone number and sending it over the network) as well as implicit information flows across multiple applications (e.g., a permission for reading the phone number and sending it to another application already installed on the user's phone). Our goal with Flow Permissions is to provide visibility into the holistic behavior of the applications installed on a user's phone. Our evaluation compares our approach to dynamic flow tracking techniques; our results with 600 popular applications and 1,200 malicious applications show that our approach is practical and effective in deriving Flow Permissions statically.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["State University of New York System", "State University of New York System", "State University of New York System", "State University of New York System", "State University of New York System"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Shashank Holavanalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holavanalli:Shashank", "Don Manuel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manuel:Don", "Vishwas Nanjundaswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nanjundaswamy:Vishwas", "Brian Rosenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenberg:Brian", "Feng Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Feng", "Steven Y.
