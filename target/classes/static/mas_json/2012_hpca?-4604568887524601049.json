{"title": "AgileRegulator: A hybrid voltage regulator scheme redeeming dark silicon for power efficiency in a multicore architecture.", "fields": ["regulator", "voltage regulator", "system on a chip", "electrical efficiency", "dark silicon"], "abstract": "The widening gap between the fast-increasing transistor budget but slow-growing power delivery and system cooling capability calls for novel architectural solutions to boost energy efficiency. Leveraging the fact of surging \u201cdark silicon\u201d area, we propose a hybrid scheme to use both on-chip and off-chip voltage regulators, called \u201cAgileRegulator\u201d, for a multicore system to explore both coarse-grain and fine-grain power phases. We present two complementary algorithms: Sensitivity-Aware Application Scheduling (SAAS) and Responsiveness-Aware Application Scheduling (RAAS) to maximally achieve the energy saving potential of the hybrid regulator scheme. Experimental results show that the hybrid scheme achieves performance-energy efficiency close to per-core DVFS, without imposing much design cost. Meanwhile, the silicon overhead of this scheme is well contained into the \u201cdark silicon\u201d. Unlike other application specific schemes based on accelerators, the proposed scheme itself is a simple and universal solution for chip area and energy trade-offs.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Guihai Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Guihai", "Yingmin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yingmin", "Yinhe Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Yinhe", "Xiaowei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiaowei", "Minyi Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Minyi", "Xiaoyao Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Xiaoyao"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
