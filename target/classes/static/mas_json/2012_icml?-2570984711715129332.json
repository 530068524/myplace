This connection introduces a natural regularized loss function which the RKHS embeddings minimise, providing an intuitive understanding of the embeddings and a justification for their use. Furthermore, the equivalence allows the application of vector-valued regression methods and results to the problem of learning conditional distributions. Using this link we derive a sparse version of the embedding by considering alternative formulations. Further, by applying convergence results for vector-valued regression to the embedding problem we derive minimax convergence rates which are O(log(n)/n) - compared to current state of the art rates of O(n-1/4) - and are valid under milder and more intuitive assumptions. These minimax upper rates coincide with lower rates up to a logarithmic factor, showing that the embedding method achieves nearly optimal rates. We study our sparse embedding algorithm in a reinforcement learning task where the algorithm shows significant improvement in sparsity over an incomplete Cholesky decomposition.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Steffen Gr\u00fcnew\u00e4lder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=uuml=new=auml=lder:Steffen", "Guy Lever.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lever:Guy", "Arthur Gretton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gretton:Arthur", "Luca Baldassarre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baldassarre:Luca", "Sam Patterson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patterson:Sam", "Massimiliano Pontil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pontil:Massimiliano"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
