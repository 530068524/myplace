In addition to assessing bonding and bridging social capital, we explore a dimension of social capital that assesses one\u2019s ability to stay connected with members of a previously inhabited community, which we call maintained social capital. Regression analyses conducted on results from a survey of undergraduate students (N = 286) suggest a strong association between use of Facebook and the three types of social capital, with the strongest relationship being to bridging social capital. In addition, Facebook usage was found to interact with measures of psychological well-being, suggesting that it might provide greater benefits for users experiencing low self-esteem and low life satisfaction.", "citation": "Citations (10,588)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Curie Institute", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Utrecht University", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "University of Leicester", "University of Nottingham", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Yale University", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of California, Berkeley", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "West Virginia University", "Michigan State University", "Microsoft", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Lifecycle Consu ...
