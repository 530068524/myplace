In this problem, the entire space with the exception of the safe zones is unsafe, but passable, and it differs from problems that involve unsafe regions to be strictly avoided. As a result, existing algorithms are not effective solutions to the new problem.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "Aalborg University", "University of Melbourne", "La Trobe University"], "authors": ["Saad Aljubayrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aljubayrin:Saad", "Jianzhong Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Jianzhong", "Christian S.
