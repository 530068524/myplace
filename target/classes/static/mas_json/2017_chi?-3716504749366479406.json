{"title": "Supporting the Use of User Generated Content in Journalistic Practice.", "fields": ["social media", "requirements analysis", "journalism", "dashboard", "user generated content"], "abstract": "Social media and user-generated content (UGC) are increasingly important features of journalistic work in a number of different ways. However, their use presents major challenges, not least because information posted on social media is not always reliable and therefore its veracity needs to be checked before it can be considered as fit for use in the reporting of news. We report on the results of a series of in-depth ethnographic studies of journalist work practices undertaken as part of the requirements gathering for a prototype of a social media verification 'dashboard' and its subsequent evaluation. We conclude with some reflections upon the broader implications of our findings for the design of tools to support journalistic work.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Warwick", "University of Siegen", "Lancaster University", "SwissInfo.ch, B ... rn, Switzerland"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Peter Tolmie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tolmie:Peter", "Rob Procter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Procter:Rob", "David William Randall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Randall:David_William", "Mark Rouncefield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rouncefield:Mark", "Christian Burger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burger:Christian", "Geraldine Wong Sak Hoi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoi:Geraldine_Wong_Sak", "Arkaitz Zubiaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zubiaga:Arkaitz", "Maria Liakata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liakata:Maria"], "pages": 13}
