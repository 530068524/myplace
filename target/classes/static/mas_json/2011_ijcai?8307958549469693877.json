We define the syntax and semantics of log-linear description logics, describe a convenient representation as sets of first-order formulas, and discuss computational and algorithmic aspects of probabilistic queries in the language. The paper concludes with an experimental evaluation of an implementation of a log-linear DL reasoner.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Mannheim", "University of Mannheim", "University of Mannheim", "University of Mannheim"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Mathias Niepert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niepert:Mathias", "Jan Noessner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noessner:Jan", "Heiner Stuckenschmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stuckenschmidt:Heiner"], "pages": 6}
