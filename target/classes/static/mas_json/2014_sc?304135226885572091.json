Herein, we describe the scientific motivation and numerical algorithms. The Milky Way model was simulated for 6 billion years, during which the bar structure and spiral arms were fully formed. This improves upon previous simulations by using 1000 times more particles, and provides a wealth of new data that can be directly compared with observations. We also report the scalability on both the Swiss Piz Daint and the US ORNL Titan. On Piz Daint the parallel efficiency of Bonsai was above 95%. The highest performance was achieved with a 242 billion particle Milky Way model using 18600 GPUs on Titan, thereby reaching a sustained GPU and application performance of 33.49 Pflops and 24.77 Pflops respectively.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "Leiden Observatory", "SURFsara Amsterdam", "National Astron ... vatory of Japan", "RIKEN AICS"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Jeroen B\u00e9dorf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=eacute=dorf:Jeroen", "Evghenii Gaburov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaburov:Evghenii", "Michiko S.
