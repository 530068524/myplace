However, sociotechnical systems are often long-term enterprises, spanning the globe and serving vast communities. Drawing from three cases of research infrastructure development, this paper demonstrates a methodology in which the ethnographer examines scalar devices: actors' techniques and technologies for knowing and managing large-scale enterprises. Such devices are enacted in and across concrete times and places; for the ethnographer they are observable as activities of scaling. By examining the enactment of scale we can better investigate diverse kinds of size and growth within sociotechnical systems.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Georgetown University"], "authors": ["David Ribes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ribes:David"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 13}
