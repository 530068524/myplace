This paper describes a framework for evaluating skylines in the presence of equijoins, including: (1) the development of algorithms to answer such queries over large input tables in a non-blocking, pipeline fashion, which significantly speeds up the entire query evaluation time. These algorithms are built on top of the traditional relational Nested-Loop and the Sort-Merge join algorithms, which allows easy implementation of these methods in existing relational systems; (2) a novel method for estimating the skyline selectivity of the joined table; (3) evaluation of skyline computation based on the estimation method and the proposed evaluation techniques; and (4) a systematic experimental evaluation to validate our skyline evaluation framework.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Wen Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Wen", "Michael D.
