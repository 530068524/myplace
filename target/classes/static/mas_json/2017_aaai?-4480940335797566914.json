All rights reserved. Adding datatypes to ontology-mediated queries (OMQs) often makes query answering hard. As a consequence, the use of datatypes in OWL 2 QL has been severely restricted. In this paper we propose a new, non-uniform, way of analyzing the data-complexity of OMQ answering with datatypes. Instead of restricting the ontology language we aim at a classification of the patterns of datatype atoms in OMQs into those that can occur in non-tractable OMQs and those that only occur in tractable OMQs. To this end we establish a close link between OMQ answering with datatypes and constraint satisfaction problems over the datatypes. In a case study we apply this link to prove a P/coNP-dichotomy for OMQs over DL-Lite extended with the datatype (Q, \u2264). The proof employs a recent dichotomy result by Bodirsky and Kara for temporal constraint satisfaction problems.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Liverpool", "University of Liverpool"], "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Hernich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hernich:Andr=eacute=", "Julio Lemos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lemos:Julio", "Frank Wolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolter:Frank"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
