{"title": "Efficient Online Learning and Prediction of Users' Desktop Actions.", "fields": ["unix", "data mining", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We investigate prediction of users' desktop activities in the Unix domain. The learning techniques we explore do not require explicit user teaching. We show that simple efficient many-class learning can perform well for action prediction, significantly improving over previously published results and baselines. This finding is promising for various human-computer interaction scenarios where a rich set of potentially predictive features is available, where there can be many different actions to predict, and where there can be considerable nonstationarity.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Artificial Intelligence Center", "Artificial Intelligence Center", "Artificial Intelligence Center"], "authors": ["Omid Madani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madani:Omid", "Hung Hai Bui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bui:Hung_Hai", "Eric Yeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeh:Eric"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
