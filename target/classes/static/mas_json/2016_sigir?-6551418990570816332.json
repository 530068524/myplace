We use qualitative and quantitative techniques to analyze 660 topics from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) previously used in the experimental evaluation of temporal retrieval models. Regression analysis is used to identify factors in previous manual classifications. We explore potential problems with the previous classifications, considering principles and guidelines for future work on temporal retrieval models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Craig Willis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willis:Craig", "Garrick Sherman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sherman:Garrick", "Miles Efron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efron:Miles"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
