{"title": "COLLECTOR: A secure RFID-enabled batch recall protocol.", "fields": ["recall", "authentication", "distributed computing", "real time computing", "database"], "abstract": "Batch recall is a practically important problem for most industry manufacturers. The batches of products which contain flawed parts need to be recalled by manufacturers in time to prevent further economic and health loss. Accurate batch recall could be a challenging issue as flawed parts may have already been integrated into a large number of products and distributed to customers. The recent development of Radio Fre- quency Identification (RFID) provides us a promising opportunity to implement batch recall in an accurate and efficient way. RFID-enabled batch recall provides us the opportunity to further enhance the security of batch recall operation, allowing us to achieve recognition of problematic products, privacy preserving of production pattern, recall authentication and non-repudiation, etc. In this paper, we thoroughly study the security aspects and identify the unique requirements in RFID-enabled batch recall. We propose a practically secure protocol, COLLECTOR, to enable accurate, secure and efficient RFID batch recall.
