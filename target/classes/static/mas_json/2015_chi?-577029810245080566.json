{"title": "WatchConnect: A Toolkit for Prototyping Smartwatch-Centric Cross-Device Applications.", "fields": ["interface design", "rapid prototyping", "input device", "smartwatch", "input output"], "abstract": "People increasingly use smartwatches in tandem with other devices such as smartphones, laptops or tablets. This allows for novel cross-device applications that use the watch as both input device and output display. However, despite the increasing availability of smartwatches, prototyping cross-device watch-centric applications remains a challenging task. Developers are limited in the applications they can explore as available toolkits provide only limited access to different types of input sensors for cross-device interactions. To address this problem, we introduce WatchConnect, a toolkit for rapidly prototyping cross-device applications and interaction techniques with smartwatches. The toolkit provides developers with (i) an extendable hardware platform that emulates a smartwatch, (ii) a UI framework that integrates with an existing UI builder, and (iii) a rich set of input and output events using a range of built-in sensor mappings. We demonstrate the versatility and design space of the toolkit with five interaction techniques and applications.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University College London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Steven Houben.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Houben:Steven", "Nicolai Marquardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marquardt:Nicolai"], "pages": 10}
