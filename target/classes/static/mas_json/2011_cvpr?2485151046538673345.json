{"title": "Face recognition in unconstrained videos with matched background similarity.", "fields": ["data set", "computer vision", "benchmark", "facial recognition system", "similarity measure"], "abstract": "Recognizing faces in unconstrained videos is a task of mounting importance. While obviously related to face recognition in still images, it has its own unique characteristics and algorithmic requirements. Over the years several methods have been suggested for this problem, and a few benchmark data sets have been assembled to facilitate its study. However, there is a sizable gap between the actual application needs and the current state of the art. In this paper we make the following contributions. (a) We present a comprehensive database of labeled videos of faces in challenging, uncontrolled conditions (i.e., \u2018in the wild\u2019), the \u2018YouTube Faces\u2019 database, along with benchmark, pair-matching tests 1 . (b) We employ our benchmark to survey and compare the performance of a large variety of existing video face recognition techniques. Finally, (c) we describe a novel set-to-set similarity measure, the Matched Background Similarity (MBGS). This similarity is shown to considerably improve performance on the benchmark tests.", "citation": "Citations (651)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Open University of Israel", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Lior Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Lior", "Tal Hassner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassner:Tal", "Itay Maoz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maoz:Itay"], "pages": 6}
