Our method is inspired by Translation Memory (TM) systems which are widely used by human translators in industrial settings. We constrain the translation of an input sentence using the most similar 'translation example' retrieved from the TM. Differently from previous research which used simple fuzzy match thresholds, these constraints are imposed using discriminative learning to optimise the translation performance. We observe that using this method can benefit the SMT system by not only producing consistent translations, but also improved translation outputs. We report a 0.9 point improvement in terms of BLEU score on English--Chinese technical documents.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Baidu", "Dublin City University", "Dublin City University", "Dublin City University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yanjun Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Yanjun", "Yifan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yifan", "Andy Way.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Way:Andy", "Josef van Genabith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Genabith:Josef_van"], "pages": 10}
