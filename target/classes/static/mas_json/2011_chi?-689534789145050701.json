Geckos are based on low-cost permanent magnets and can also be used on non-horizontal surfaces. Unique pressure footprints are used to identify each tangible Gecko. Two types of tangible object designs are presented: Using a single magnet in combination with felt pads provides new pressure-based interaction modalities. Using multiple separate magnets it is possible to change the marker footprint dynamically and create new haptic experiences. The tangible object design and interaction are illustrated with example applications. We also give details on the feasibility and benefits of our tracking approach and show compatibility with other tracking technologies.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Media Interacti ... enberg, Austria", "Media Interacti ... enberg, Austria"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jakob Leitner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leitner:Jakob", "Michael Haller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haller:Michael"], "pages": 10}
