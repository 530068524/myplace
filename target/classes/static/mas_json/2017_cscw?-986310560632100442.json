{"title": "SearchMessenger: Exploring the Use of Search and Card Sharing in a Messaging Application.", "fields": ["multimedia", "card sharing", "internet privacy", "ticket", "mobile search"], "abstract": "Previous work creating systems for collaborative search has mainly focused on solutions for the desktop. However, as the majority of web use moves to mobile phones, few systems have been created on this platform to support collaboration around search results. Mobile search is often a collaborative activity where the input of a group is sought before making a decision to purchase something, visit a venue, or book a ticket. However, currently search and messaging applications are separate, creating frustrating copy-and-paste interactions and uninformative blue links or OpenGraph cards in messages. We built the Search Messenger system to support both finding and sharing search results, in the form of rich, interactive cards, directly within a mobile messaging system. After building the system, we conducted a two-week field study exploring how 14 participants used the system in their daily lives. We report on our findings and implications for future mobile applications that embed functionality in messaging.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Frank R.
