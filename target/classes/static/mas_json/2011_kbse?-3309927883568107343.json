If faults are detected, a fault localization algorithm can be used to reduce the manual inspection cost. However, while using test case prioritization to enhance the rate of fault detection of the test suite (e.g., statement coverage), the diagnostic information gain per test is not optimal, which results in needless inspection cost during diagnosis. We present RAPTOR, a test prioritization algorithm for fault localization, based on reducing the similarity between statement execution patterns as the testing progresses. Unlike previous diagnostic prioritization algorithms, RAPTOR does not require false negative information, and is much less complex. Experimental results from the Software Infrastructure Repository's benchmarks show that RAPTOR is the best technique under realistic conditions, with average cost reductions of 40% with respect to the next best technique, with negligible impact on fault detection capability.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "University of Porto", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez-Sanchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonz=aacute=lez=Sanchez:Alberto", "Rui Abreu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abreu:Rui", "Hans-Gerhard Gross.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gross:Hans=Gerhard", "Arjan J.
