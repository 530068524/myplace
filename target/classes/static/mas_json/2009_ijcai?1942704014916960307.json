We introduce a novel concept of MPL (Minimum Prediction Length) and develop ECTS (Early Classification on Time Series), an effective 1-nearest neighbor classification method. ECTS makes early predictions and at the same time retains the accuracy comparable to that of a 1NN classifier using the full-length time series. Our empirical study using benchmark time series data sets shows that ECTS works well on the real data sets where 1NN classification is effective.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Zhengzheng Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Zhengzheng", "Jian Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Jian", "Philip S.
