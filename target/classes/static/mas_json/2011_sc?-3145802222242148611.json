{"title": "SCMFS: a file system for storage class memory.", "fields": ["conventional memory", "registered memory", "flash file system", "flat memory model", "memory mapped file"], "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of how to implement a file system on Storage Class Memory (SCM), that is directly connected to the memory bus, byte addressable and is also non-volatile. In this paper, we propose a new file system, called SCMFS, which is implemented on the virtual address space. In SCMFS, we utilize the existing memory management module in the operating system to do the block management and keep the space always contiguous for each file. The simplicity of SCMFS not only makes it easy to implement, but also improves the performance. We have implemented a prototype in Linux and evaluated its performance through multiple benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (257)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["XiaoJian Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:XiaoJian", "A.
