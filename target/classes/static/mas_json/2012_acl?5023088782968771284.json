{"title": "Efficient Search for Transformation-based Inference.", "fields": ["machine learning", "search algorithm", "inference", "evaluation function", "search problem"], "abstract": "This paper addresses the search problem in textual inference, where systems need to infer one piece of text from another. A prominent approach to this task is attempts to transform one text into the other through a sequence of inference-preserving transformations, a.k.a. a proof, while estimating the proof's validity. This raises a search challenge of finding the best possible proof. We explore this challenge through a comprehensive investigation of prominent search algorithms and propose two novel algorithmic components specifically designed for textual inference: a gradient-style evaluation function, and a local-lookahead node expansion method. Evaluations, using the open-source system, BiuTee, show the contribution of these ideas to search efficiency and proof quality.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Bar-Ilan University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Asher Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern_0001:Asher", "Roni Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Roni", "Ido Dagan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dagan:Ido", "Ariel Felner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felner:Ariel"], "pages": 9}
