{"title": "Approximate Distance Oracles with Improved Bounds.", "fields": ["oracle", "integer", "combinatorics", "data structure", "graph"], "abstract": "A distance oracle is a compact data structure capable of quickly estimating distances in a given graph. In this paper we provide a new construction for distance oracles in general undirected weighted graphs. Our data structure, for any integer k, requires O( n 1+1/k ) space, guarantees a stretch of 2k-1, and answers any query in only O(1) time.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shiri Chechik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechik:Shiri"], "pages": 10}
