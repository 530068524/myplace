In this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Online Metric Learning (SOML) scheme for learning sparse distance functions from large-scale high-dimensional data and explore its application to image retrieval. In contrast to many existing distance metric learning algorithms that are often designed for low-dimensional data, the proposed algorithms are able to learn sparse distance metrics from high-dimensional data in an efficient and scalable manner. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better or at least comparable accuracy performance than the state-of-the-art non-sparse distance metric learning approaches, but enjoys a significant advantage in computational efficiency and sparsity, making it more practical for real-world applications.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Nanyang Technological University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Xingyu Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Xingyu", "Steven C.
