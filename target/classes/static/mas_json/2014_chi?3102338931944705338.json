What modern presentations gain through visual slide support, however, is often at the expense of storytelling. We present TurningPoint, a probe to investigate the potential use of narrative-driven talk planning in slideware. Our study of TurningPoint reveals a delicate balance between narrative templates focusing author attention in ways that save time, and fixating attention in ways that limit experimentation.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Larissa Pschetz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pschetz:Larissa", "Koji Yatani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yatani:Koji", "Darren Edge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edge:Darren"], "pages": 4}
