{"title": "Markerless motion capture of interacting characters using multi-view image segmentation.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "motion capture", "active appearance model", "ground truth", "skeleton"], "abstract": "We present a markerless motion capture approach that reconstructs the skeletal motion and detailed time-varying surface geometry of two closely interacting people from multi-view video. Due to ambiguities in feature-to-person assignments and frequent occlusions, it is not feasible to directly apply single-person capture approaches to the multi-person case. We therefore propose a combined image segmentation and tracking approach to overcome these difficulties. A new probabilistic shape and appearance model is employed to segment the input images and to assign each pixel uniquely to one person. Thereafter, a single-person markerless motion and surface capture approach can be applied to each individual, either one-by-one or in parallel, even under strong occlusions. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on several challenging multi-person motions, including dance and martial arts, and also provide a reference dataset for multi-person motion capture with ground truth.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "MPI Informatik", "MPI Informatik", "MPI Informatik", "MPI Informatik"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yebin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yebin", "Carsten Stoll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoll:Carsten", "Juergen Gall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gall:Juergen", "Hans-Peter Seidel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidel:Hans=Peter", "Christian Theobalt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobalt:Christian"], "pages": 8}
