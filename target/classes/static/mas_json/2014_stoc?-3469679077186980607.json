{"title": "Community detection thresholds and the weak Ramanujan property.", "fields": ["ramanujan s sum", "matrix", "stochastic block model", "adjacency matrix", "spectral radius"], "abstract": "Decelle et al. [1] conjectured the existence of a sharp threshold on model parameters for community detection in sparse random graphs drawn from the  stochastic block model . Mossel, Neeman and Sly [2] established the negative part of the conjecture, proving impossibility of non-trivial reconstruction below the threshold. In this work we solve the positive part of the conjecture. To that end we introduce a modified adjacency matrix  B  which counts  self-avoiding  paths of a given length  e  between pairs of nodes. We then prove that for logarithmic length  e , the leading eigenvectors of this modified matrix provide a non-trivial reconstruction of the underlying structure, thereby settling the conjecture. A key step in the proof consists in establishing a  weak Ramanujan property  of the constructed matrix  B . Namely, the spectrum of  B  consists in two leading eigenvalues  \u03c1 ( B ),  \u03bb  2  and  n  -- 2 eigenvalues of a lower order  O ( n   e   \u221a \u03c1 ( B ) for all  e  0,  \u03c1 ( B ) denoting  B 's spectral radius.", "citation": "Citations (238)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Laurent Massouli\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massouli=eacute=:Laurent"], "pages": 10}
