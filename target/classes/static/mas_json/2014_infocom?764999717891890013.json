In Infrastructure as a Service settings, cloud providers do not exploit this characteristic to better manage VMs because they view VMs as \u201cblack boxes.\u201d We present TideWatch, a system that automatically identifies cyclicality and similarity in running VMs. TideWatch predicts period lengths of most VMs in Hadoop workloads within 9% of actual iteration boundaries and successfully classifies up to 95% of running VMs as participating in the appropriate Hadoop cluster. Furthermore, we show how TideWatch can be used to improve the timing of VM migrations, reducing both migration time and network impact by over 50% when compared to a random approach.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["IBM", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "IBM"], "authors": ["Dan Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Dan", "Shuai Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0002:Shuai", "Xiangliang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiangliang", "Hani Jamjoom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jamjoom:Hani"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
