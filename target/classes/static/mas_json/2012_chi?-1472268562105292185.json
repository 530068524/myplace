TEROOS allows the users who wear it and control it to share a vision remotely. Moreover, the avatar has an anthropomorphic face that enables the user who controls it to communicate with people co-located with the user who wears it. We have a field test by using TEROOS and observed that the wearable avatar innovatively assisted the users to communicate during their joint activities such as route navigating and buying goods at a shop. The user controlling TEROOS could give the user wearing it appropriate route instructions on the basis of the situation around TEROOS. In addition, both users could easily identify objects that they discussed. Moreover, shop staff members communicated with the user controlling TEROOS and behaved as they normally would when the user asked questions about the goods.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University", "ATR Intelligent ... n, Kyoto, Japan"], "authors": ["Tadakazu Kashiwabara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kashiwabara:Tadakazu", "Hirotaka Osawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Osawa:Hirotaka", "Kazuhiko Shinozawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shinozawa:Kazuhiko", "Michita Imai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Imai:Michita"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
