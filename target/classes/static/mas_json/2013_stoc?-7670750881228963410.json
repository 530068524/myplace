This leads to a tight (upper and lower bound) characterization of the communication complexity of the set intersection problem on subsets of {1,...,n} (the player are required to compute the intersection of their sets), whose randomized communication complexity tends to C \u2227 \u22c5 n pm o(n) as the error tends to zero.   The information-optimal protocol we present has an infinite number of rounds. We show this is necessary by proving that the rate of convergence of the r-round information cost of AND to IC(AND,0)=C \u2227  behaves like \u0398(1/r 2 ), i.e. that the r-round information complexity of AND is C \u2227 +\u0398(1/r 2 ).   We leverage the tight analysis obtained for the information complexity of AND to calculate and prove the exact communication complexity of the  set disjointness  function Disj n (X,Y) = - v i=1  n  AND(x i ,y i ) with error tending to 0, which turns out to be = C DISJ \u22c5 n pm o(n), where C DISJ \u2245 0.4827. Our rate of convergence results imply that an asymptotically optimal protocol for set disjointness will have to use \u03c9(1) rounds of communication, since every r-round protocol will be sub-optimal by at least \u03a9(n/r 2 ) bits of communication.   We also obtain the tight bound of 2/ln2 k pm o(k) on the communication complexity of disjointness of sets of size \u2264 k. An asymptotic bound of \u0398(k) was previously shown by Hastad and Wigderson.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "University of Chicago", "Princeton University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Mark Braverman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braverman:Mark", "Ankit Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Ankit", "Denis Pankratov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pankratov:Denis", "Omri Weinstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weinstein:Omri"], "pages": 10}
