Given part annotations on very few (e.g., 3-12) objects, our method mines certain latent patterns from the pre-trained CNN and associates them with different semantic parts. We use a four-layer And-Or graph to organize the CNN units, so as to clarify their internal semantic hierarchy. Our method is guided by a small number of part annotations, and it achieves superior part-localization performance (about 13%-107% improvement in part center prediction on the PASCAL VOC and ImageNet datasets)", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Quanshi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Quanshi", "Ruiming Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Ruiming", "Ying Nian Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ying_Nian", "Song-Chun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Song=Chun"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
