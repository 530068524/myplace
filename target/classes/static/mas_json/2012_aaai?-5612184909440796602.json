The system accepts a set of keywords representing the writing intents from a writer and generates sentences one by one to form a completed poem. A statistical machine translation (SMT) system is applied to generate new sentences, given the sentences generated previously. For each line of sentence a specific model specially trained for that line is used, as opposed to using a single model for all sentences. To enhance the coherence of sentences on every line, a coherence model using mutual information is applied to select candidates with better consistency with previous sentences. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the BLEU metric for evaluation with a novel method of generating diverse references.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jing He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Jing", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Ming", "Long Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Long"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
