At the 21st anniversary of that published vision, I want to assess ubicomp's maturity and explore the identity challenge it faces. Today, ubicomp as a niche research topic no longer makes sense; we must celebrate its \"disappearance\" as a well-scoped research agenda because it has become a profound agenda across most of computing, and beyond. This should not be surprising; the 2 nd  generation of computing, the personal computer revolution, experienced the same profound disappearance. In celebration of this imminent disappearance, I will highlight the unique contributions of the ubicomp community, express some remaining intellectual challenges, and speculate on how to formulate new visions of computing that might succeed this third generation.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Gregory D.
