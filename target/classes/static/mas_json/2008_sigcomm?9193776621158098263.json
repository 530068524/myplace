Being largely network-oblivious, many P2P applications may lead to inefficient network resource usage and/or low application performance. In this paper, we propose a simple architecture called P4P to allow for more effective cooperative traffic control between applications and network providers. We conducted extensive simulations and real-life experiments on the Internet to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of P4P. Our experiments demonstrated that P4P either improves or maintains the same level of application performance of native P2P applications, while, at the same time, it substantially reduces network provider cost compared with either native or latency-based localized P2P applications.", "citation": "Citations (951)", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University", "University of Washington", "IBM", "Yale University"], "authors": ["Haiyong Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Haiyong", "Yang Richard Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yang_Richard", "Arvind Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Arvind", "Yanbin Grace Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yanbin_Grace", "Abraham Silberschatz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silberschatz:Abraham"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
