{"title": "Parallel and Streaming Algorithms for K-Core Decomposition.", "fields": ["graph", "streaming algorithm", "artificial intelligence", "computation", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The $k$-core decomposition is a fundamental primitive in many machine learning and data mining applications. We present the first distributed and the first streaming algorithms to compute and maintain an approximate $k$-core decomposition with provable guarantees. Our algorithms achieve rigorous bounds on space complexity while bounding the number of passes or number of rounds of computation. We do so by presenting a new powerful sketching technique for $k$-core decomposition, and then by showing it can be computed efficiently in both streaming and MapReduce models. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of our sketching technique empirically on a number of publicly available graphs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Hossein Esfandiari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esfandiari:Hossein", "Silvio Lattanzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lattanzi:Silvio", "Vahab S.
