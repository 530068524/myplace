{"title": "Integrating Learning into a BDI Agent for Environments with Changing Dynamics.", "fields": ["scale up", "controller", "error driven learning", "energy management", "programming paradigm"], "abstract": "We propose a framework that adds learning for improving plan selection in the popular BDI agent programming paradigm. In contrast with previous proposals, the approach given here is able to scale up well with the complexity of the agent's plan library. Technically, we develop a novel confidence measure which allows the agent to adjust its reliance on the learning dynamically, facilitating in principle infinitely many (re)learning phases. We demonstrate the benefits of the approach in an example controller for energy management.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["RMIT University", "RMIT University", "RMIT University", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Dhirendra Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Dhirendra", "Sebastian Sardi\u00f1a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sardi=ntilde=a:Sebastian", "Lin Padgham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padgham:Lin", "Geoff James.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/James:Geoff"], "pages": 6}
