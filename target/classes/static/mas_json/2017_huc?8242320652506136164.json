{"title": "In-classroom self-tracking for teachers and students: preliminary findings from a pilot study.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "data collection", "mood", "computer science"], "abstract": "Self-tracking technologies are nowadays commonly used in areas like fitness or personal health. Their use in the work environment is however still under-explored. Employers do have an interest in utilizing technology to quantify different work-related factors, e.g., the use of office space, the interactions among employees, or the collective mood at work. We however advocate for a stronger focus on empowering individuals to self-track their own activities, emotions and performance at work, to reflect on the collected data and possibly use it to drive behavioral changes. In this paper, we focus in particular on empowering two specific categories of workers: teachers and students. We describe a pilot study that we ran at our institution to understand which data and data gathering tools can be used to monitor teachers' and students' emotions and engagement during lectures. We define an empirical metric, called the  Emotional Shift , to assess the impact of a lecture on students emotional state. Using the data collected during our pilot study, we show how this metric can be used in practice. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our current approach and provide an outlook on our future work.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Elena Di Lascio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lascio:Elena_Di", "Shkurta Gashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gashi:Shkurta", "Danilo Krasic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krasic:Danilo", "Silvia Santini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santini:Silvia"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
