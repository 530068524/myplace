However, the drawback is that the predictive accuracy of the model can be significantly compromised if the observations are contaminated by outliers. A robust observation model, such as the Student-t distribution, reduces the influence of outlying observations and improves the predictions. The problem, however, is the analytically intractable inference. In this work, we discuss the properties of a Gaussian process regression model with the Student-t likelihood and utilize the Laplace approximation for approximate inference. We compare our approach to a variational approximation and a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, which utilize the commonly used scale mixture representation of the Student-t distribution.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Helsinki University of Technology", "Helsinki University of Technology", "Helsinki University of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jarno Vanhatalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanhatalo:Jarno", "Pasi Jyl\u00e4nki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jyl=auml=nki:Pasi", "Aki Vehtari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vehtari:Aki"], "pages": 9}
