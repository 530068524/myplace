{"title": "Robust Value Function Approximation Using Bilinear Programming.", "fields": ["bilinear interpolation", "discrete mathematics", "bilinear program", "residual", "bellman equation"], "abstract": "Existing value function approximation methods have been successfully used in many applications, but they often lack useful a priori error bounds. We propose approximate bilinear programming, a new formulation of value function approximation that provides strong a priori guarantees. In particular, this approach provably finds an approximate value function that minimizes the Bellman residual. Solving a bilinear program optimally is NP-hard, but this is unavoidable because the Bellman-residual minimization itself is NP-hard. We therefore employ and analyze a common approximate algorithm for bilinear programs. The analysis shows that this algorithm offers a convergent generalization of approximate policy iteration. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can consistently minimize the Bellman residual on a simple benchmark problem.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Marek Petrik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrik:Marek", "Shlomo Zilberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zilberstein:Shlomo"], "pages": 9}
