{"title": "Sounds of silence: exploring contributions to conversations, non-responses and the impact of mediating technologies in triple space.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "common ground", "social psychology", "silence", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "We investigate collocated triads as they play a collaborative, problem-solving game using distributed technology on laptops. We examine how different triads attain and maintain mutual understanding in triple-space--when working on a hard problem, with communicating technologies and face-to-face interaction. We present qualitative and quantitative evidence that demonstrates the descriptive adequacy of a model of triadic interaction in triple space. We use that model to argue that the notion of good-enoughness is not a group attribute, but rather tied to each dyadic pair. This intellectual framework allows us to examine how non- response operates within these triple-space interactions when interaction is supported by different media. The results related to non-response raise the possibility that different media may result in subtle influence on the balance of participant goals.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Joon-Suk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joon=Suk", "Deborah G.
