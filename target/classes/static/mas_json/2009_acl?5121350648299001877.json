{"title": "A Syntax-Driven Bracketing Model for Phrase-Based Translation.", "fields": ["parsing", "phrase", "bracket", "bracketing", "sentence"], "abstract": "Syntactic analysis influences the way in which the source sentence is translated. Previous efforts add syntactic constraints to phrase-based translation by directly rewarding/punishing a hypothesis whenever it matches/violates source-side constituents. We present a new model that automatically learns syntactic constraints, including but not limited to constituent matching/violation, from training corpus. The model brackets a source phrase as to whether it satisfies the learnt syntactic constraints. The bracketed phrases are then translated as a whole unit by the decoder. Experimental results and analysis show that the new model outperforms other previous methods and achieves a substantial improvement over the baseline which is not syntactically informed.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Human Language  ... xis, Singapore", "Human Language  ... xis, Singapore", "Human Language  ... xis, Singapore", "Human Language  ... xis, Singapore"], "authors": ["Deyi Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Deyi", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Min", "AiTi Aw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aw:AiTi", "Haizhou Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Haizhou"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
