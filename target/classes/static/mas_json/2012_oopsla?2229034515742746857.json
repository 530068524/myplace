{"title": "GPUVerify: a verifier for GPU kernels.", "fields": ["general purpose computing on graphics processing units", "thread", "loop invariant", "cuda", "operational semantics"], "abstract": "We present a technique for verifying race- and divergence-freedom of GPU kernels that are written in mainstream kernel programming languages such as OpenCL and CUDA. Our approach is founded on a novel formal operational semantics for GPU programming termed synchronous, delayed visibility (SDV) semantics. The SDV semantics provides a precise definition of barrier divergence in GPU kernels and allows kernel verification to be reduced to analysis of a sequential program, thereby completely avoiding the need to reason about thread interleavings, and allowing existing modular techniques for program verification to be leveraged. We describe an efficient encoding for data race detection and propose a method for automatically inferring loop invariants required for verification. We have implemented these techniques as a practical verification tool, GPUVerify, which can be applied directly to OpenCL and CUDA source code. We evaluate GPUVerify with respect to a set of 163 kernels drawn from public and commercial sources. Our evaluation demonstrates that GPUVerify is capable of efficient, automatic verification of a large number of real-world kernels.", "citation": "Citations (112)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Microsoft", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Adam Betts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Betts:Adam", "Nathan Chong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chong:Nathan", "Alastair F.
