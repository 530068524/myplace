{"title": "PoiRoot: investigating the root cause of interdomain path changes.", "fields": ["recursion", "root cause", "the internet", "routing protocol", "root cause analysis"], "abstract": "Interdomain path changes occur frequently. Because routing protocols expose insufficient information to reason about all changes, the general problem of identifying the root cause remains unsolved. In this work, we design and evaluate  PoiRoot , a real-time system that allows a provider to accurately isolate the root cause (the network responsible) of path changes affecting its prefixes. First, we develop a new model describing path changes and use it to provably identify the set of all potentially responsible networks. Next, we develop a recursive algorithm that accurately isolates the root cause of any path change. We observe that the algorithm requires monitoring paths that are generally not visible using standard measurement tools. To address this limitation, we combine existing measurement tools in new ways to acquire path information required for isolating the root cause of a path change. We evaluate  PoiRoot  on path changes obtained through controlled Internet experiments, simulations, and \"in-the-wild\" measurements. We demonstrate that  PoiRoot  is highly accurate, works well even with partial information, and generally narrows down the root cause to a single network or two neighboring ones. On controlled experiments  PoiRoot  is 100% accurate, as opposed to prior work which is accurate only 61.7% of the time.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "University of Washington", "University of Southern California", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Umar Javed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Javed:Umar", "\u00cdtalo Cunha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cunha:=Iacute=talo", "David R.
