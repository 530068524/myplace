{"title": "Detecting Fair Non-termination in Multithreaded Programs.", "fields": ["linear temporal logic", "context switch", "mutual exclusion", "thread", "limiting"], "abstract": "We develop compositional analysis algorithms for detecting non-termination in multithreaded programs. Our analysis explores fair and ultimately-periodic executions--i.e., those in which the infinitely-often enabled threads repeatedly execute the same sequences of actions over and over. By limiting the number of context-switches each thread is allowed along any repeating action sequence, our algorithm quickly discovers practically-arising non-terminating executions. Limiting the number of context-switches in each period leads to a compositional analysis in which we consider each thread separately, in isolation, and reduces the search for fair ultimately-periodic executions in multithreaded programs to state-reachability in sequential programs. We implement our analysis by a systematic code-to-code translation from multithreaded programs to sequential programs. By leveraging standard sequential analysis tools, our prototype tool Mutant is able to discover fair non-terminating executions in typical mutual exclusion protocols and concurrent data-structure algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Paris Diderot University", "Paris Diderot University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Mohamed Faouzi Atig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atig:Mohamed_Faouzi", "Ahmed Bouajjani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouajjani:Ahmed", "Michael Emmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Emmi:Michael", "Akash Lal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lal:Akash"], "pages": 17}
