It is desirable for fuzzers to allow targeted generation of programs that showcase specific language features and behaviors. However, the predominant program generation technique used by most language fuzzers, stochastic context-free grammars, does not have this property. We propose the use of constraint logic programming (CLP) for program generation. Using CLP, testers can write declarative predicates specifying interesting programs, including syntactic features and semantic behaviors. CLP subsumes and generalizes the stochastic grammar approach.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Kyle Dewey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dewey:Kyle", "Jared Roesch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roesch:Jared", "Ben Hardekopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardekopf:Ben"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 6}
