However, in traditional ECOC framework, all the base classifiers are trained independently according to the defined ECOC matrix. In this paper, we reformulate the ECOC models from the perspective of multi-task learning, where the binary classifiers are learned in a common subspace of data. This novel model can be considered as an adaptive generalization of the traditional ECOC framework. It simultaneously optimizes the representation of data as well as the binary classifiers. More importantly, it builds a bridge between the ECOC framework and multitask learning for multi-class learning problems. To deal with complex data, we also present the kernel extension of the proposed model. Extensive empirical study on 14 data sets from UCI machine learning repository and the USPS handwritten digits recognition application demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our model.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Guoqiang Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Guoqiang", "Mohamed Cheriet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheriet:Mohamed"], "pages": 7}
