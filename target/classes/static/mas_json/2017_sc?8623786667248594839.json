Compiler-based FI frameworks inject faults at a high intermediate-representation level. However, they are less accurate than machine code, binary-level FI because they lack access to all dynamic instructions, thus they fail to mimic certain fault manifestations. In this paper, we study the limitations of current practices in compiler-based FI and how they impact the interpretation of results in resilience studies.   We propose REFINE, a novel framework that addresses these limitations, performing FI in a compiler backend. Our approach provides the portability and efficiency of compiler-based FI, while keeping accuracy comparable to binary-level FI methods. We demonstrate our approach in 14 HPC programs and show that, due to our unique design, its runtime overhead is significantly smaller than state-of-the-art compiler-based FI frameworks, reducing the time for large FI experiments.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Queen's University Belfast", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Queen's University Belfast", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Giorgis Georgakoudis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Georgakoudis:Giorgis", "Ignacio Laguna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laguna:Ignacio", "Dimitrios S.
