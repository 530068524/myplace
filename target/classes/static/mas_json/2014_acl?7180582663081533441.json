We test our vocabulary generator on seven low-resource languages by measuring the decrease in out-of-vocabulary word rate on a held-out test set. The languages we study have very different morphological properties; we show how our results differ depending on the morphological complexity of the language. In our best result (on Assamese), our approach can predict 29% of the token-based out-of-vocabulary with a small amount of unlabeled training data.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mohammad Sadegh Rasooli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rasooli:Mohammad_Sadegh", "Thomas Lippincott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lippincott:Thomas", "Nizar Habash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habash:Nizar", "Owen Rambow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rambow:Owen"], "pages": 11}
