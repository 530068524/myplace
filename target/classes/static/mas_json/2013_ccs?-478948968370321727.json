{"title": "Automatic verification of protocols with lists of unbounded length.", "fields": ["cryptographic protocol", "horn clause", "secrecy", "xml", "soundness"], "abstract": "We present a novel automatic technique for proving secrecy and authentication properties for security protocols that manipulate lists of unbounded length, for an unbounded number of sessions. This result is achieved by extending the Horn clause approach of the automatic protocol verifier ProVerif. We extend the Horn clauses to be able to represent lists of unbounded length. We adapt the resolution algorithm to handle the new class of Horn clauses, and prove the soundness of this new algorithm. We have implemented our algorithm and successfully tested it on several protocol examples, including XML protocols coming from web services.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Bruno Blanchet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanchet:Bruno", "Miriam Paiola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paiola:Miriam"], "pages": 12}
