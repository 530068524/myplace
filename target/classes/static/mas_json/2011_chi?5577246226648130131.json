To that end we created Zydeco, a mobile system to scaffold learners through the science inquiry process in and out of the classroom, and tested it in a museum with 42 middle school students. Students report that tags encouraged reflection and annotation during data collection, suggesting that tagging can be used to support nomadic inquiry. From this work we present some emerging design recommendations for constructing similar systems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alex Kuhn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhn:Alex", "Clara Cahill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cahill:Clara", "Chris Quintana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quintana:Chris", "Shannon Schmoll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmoll:Shannon"], "pages": 4}
