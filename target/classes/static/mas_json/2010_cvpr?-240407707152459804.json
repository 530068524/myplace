{"title": "Adaptive generic learning for face recognition from a single sample per person.", "fields": ["linear discriminant analysis", "training set", "scatter matrix", "discriminative model", "facial recognition system"], "abstract": "Real-world face recognition systems often have to face the single sample per person (SSPP) problem, that is, only a single training sample for each person is enrolled in the database. In this case, many of the popular face recognition methods fail to work well due to the inability to learn the discriminatory information specific to the persons to be identified. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Generic Learning (AGL) method, which adapts a generic discriminant model to better distinguish the persons with single face sample. As a specific implementation of the AGL, a Coupled Linear Representation (CLR) algorithm is proposed to infer, based on the generic training set, the within-class scatter matrix and the class mean of each person given its single enrolled sample. Thus, the traditional Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) can be applied to SSPP task. Experiments on the FERET and a challenging passport face database show that the proposed method can achieve better results compared with other common solutions to the SSPP problem.", "citation": "Citations (115)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yu Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su_0010:Yu", "Shiguang Shan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shan:Shiguang", "Xilin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xilin", "Wen Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Wen"], "pages": 8}
