Not knowing the exact provenance and processing pipeline used to produce a derived data set often renders the data set useless from a scientific point of view. On the positive side, capturing provenance information is facilitated by the widespread use of workflow tools for processing scientific data. The workflow process describes all the steps involved in producing a given data set and, hence, captures its lineage. On the negative side, efficiently storing and querying workflow based data lineage is not trivial. All existing solutions use recursive queries and even recursive tables to represent the workflows. Such solutions do not scale and are rather inefficient. In this paper we propose an alternative approach to storing lineage information captured as a workflow process. We use a space and query efficient interval representation for dependency graphs and show how to transform arbitrary workflow processes into graphs that can be stored using such representation. We also characterize the problem in terms of its overall complexity and provide a comprehensive performance evaluation of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (133)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Thomas Heinis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinis:Thomas", "Gustavo Alonso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alonso:Gustavo"], "pages": 12}
