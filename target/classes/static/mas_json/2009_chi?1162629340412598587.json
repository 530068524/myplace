{"title": "On being supple: in search of rigor without rigidity in meeting new design and evaluation challenges for HCI practitioners.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "knowledge management", "computer science", "body of knowledge", "rigidity"], "abstract": "In this paper, we argue that HCI practitioners are facing new challenges in design and evaluation that can benefit from the establishment of commonly valued use qualities, with associated strategies for producing and rigorously evaluating work. We present a particular use quality 'suppleness' as an example. We describe ways that use qualities can help shape design and evaluation process, and propose tactics for the CHI community to use to encourage the evolution of bodies of knowledge around use qualities.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["New York University", "Swedish Institute of Computer Science"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Katherine Isbister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isbister:Katherine", "Kristina H\u00f6\u00f6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml==ouml=k:Kristina"], "pages": 10}
