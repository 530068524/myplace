Although knowledge evolution and real-time reasoning have been largely addressed in ontology streams, the challenge of predicting its future (or missing) knowledge remains open and yet unexplored. We tackle predictive reasoning as a correlation and interpretation of past semantics-augmented data over exogenous ontology streams. Consistent predictions are constructed as Description Logics entailments by selecting and applying relevant cross-streams association rules. The experiments have shown accurate prediction with real and live stream data from Dublin City in Ireland.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["IBM", "University of Aberdeen"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Freddy L\u00e9cu\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=eacute=cu=eacute=:Freddy", "Jeff Z.
