However, they continue provide critical information as well as be part of a rich social context for action. The following study focuses on the expression of emotions within the context of a particular work environment -- an emergency room -- and high-lights how it is used, why it is invisible in the work, and how it continues to persist through workarounds. These workarounds provide indications towards the design of so-ciotechnical systems to continue to support the expression of invisible emotions.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Helena M.
