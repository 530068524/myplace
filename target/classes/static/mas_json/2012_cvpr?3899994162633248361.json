It is efficient to learn, compared to other Sequential Pattern methods, and scalable for use with large classifier banks. For these reasons it is well suited to Sign Language Recognition. Using deterministic robust features based on hand trajectories, sign level classifiers are built from sub-units. Results are presented both on a large lexicon single signer data set and a multi-signer Kinect\u2122 data set. In both cases it is shown to out perform the non-discriminative Markov model approach and be equivalent to previous, more costly, Sequential Pattern (SP) techniques.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "University of Surrey", "University of Surrey", "University of Surrey"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Eng-Jon Ong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ong:Eng=Jon", "Helen Cooper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cooper:Helen", "Nicolas Pugeault.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pugeault:Nicolas", "Richard Bowden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bowden:Richard"], "pages": 8}
