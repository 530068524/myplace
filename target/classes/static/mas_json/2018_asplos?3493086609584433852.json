{"title": "Sulong, and Thanks for All the Bugs: Finding Errors in C Programs by Abstracting from the Native Execution Model.", "fields": ["argument of a function", "execution model", "memory errors", "data mapping", "interpreter"], "abstract": "In C, memory errors, such as buffer overflows, are among the most dangerous software errors; as we show, they are still on the rise. Current dynamic bug-finding tools that try to detect such errors are based on the low-level execution model of the underlying machine. They insert additional checks in an ad-hoc fashion, which makes them prone to omitting checks for corner cases. To address this, we devised a novel approach to finding bugs during the execution of a program. At the core of this approach is an interpreter written in a high-level language that performs automatic checks (such as bounds, NULL, and type checks). By mapping data structures in C to those of the high-level language, accesses are automatically checked and bugs discovered. We have implemented this approach and show that our tool (called Safe Sulong) can find bugs that state-of-the-art tools overlook, such as out-of-bounds accesses to the main function arguments.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Oracle Corporation", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Oracle Corporation", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Manuel Rigger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rigger:Manuel", "Roland Schatz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schatz:Roland", "Ren\u00e9 Mayrhofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayrhofer:Ren=eacute=", "Matthias Grimmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grimmer:Matthias", "Hanspeter M\u00f6ssenb\u00f6ck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=ouml=ssenb=ouml=ck:Hanspeter"], "pages": 15}
