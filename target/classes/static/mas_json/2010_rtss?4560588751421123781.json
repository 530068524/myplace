In this paper, such factors are investigated through an empirical comparison of global, partitioned, and clustered EDF scheduling algorithms on a 24-core Intel system. On this platform, global EDF proved to be a non-viable choice for hard real time systems, while clusters of size six practically approximated global approaches. For soft real-time systems, clustered EDF scheduling algorithms proved to be particularly effective. This study suggests that future global scheduling research should focus on small-to-medium multicore platforms rather than large platforms.", "citation": "Citations (162)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Andrea Bastoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bastoni:Andrea", "Bj\u00f6rn B.
