{"title": "Fast Interpolating BMC.", "fields": ["propositional formula", "bounded function", "conjunctive normal form", "boolean satisfiability problem", "counterexample"], "abstract": "Bounded Model Checking (BMC) is well known for its simplicity and ability to find counterexamples. It is based on the idea of symbolically representing counterexamples in a transition system and then using a SAT solver to check for their existence or their absence. State-of-the-art BMC algorithms combine a direct translation to SAT with circuit-aware simplifications and work incrementally, sharing information between different bounds. While BMC is incomplete (it can only show existence of counterexamples), it is a major building block of several complete interpolation-based model checking algorithms. However, traditional interpolation is incompatible with optimized BMC. Hence, these algorithms rely on simple BMC engines that significantly hinder their performance. In this paper, we present a Fast Interpolating BMC (Fib) that combines state-of-the-art BMC techniques with interpolation. We show how to interpolate in the presence of circuit-aware simplifications and in the context of incremental solving. We evaluate our implementation of Fib in AVY, an interpolating property directed model checker, and show that it has a great positive effect on the overall performance. With the Fib, AVY outperforms ABC implementation of Pdr on both HWMCC\u201913 and HWMCC\u201914 benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Software Engineering Institute", "Princeton University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Yakir Vizel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vizel:Yakir", "Arie Gurfinkel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurfinkel:Arie", "Sharad Malik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malik:Sharad"], "pages": 17}
