Yet, improper publishing and use of transit data could jeopardize passengers' privacy. In this paper, we present our solution to transit data publication under the rigorous  differential privacy  model for the  Societe de transport de Montreal  (STM). We propose an efficient  data-dependent  yet differentially private transit data sanitization approach based on a  hybrid-granularity  prefix tree structure. Moreover, as a post-processing step, we make use of the inherent consistency constraints of a prefix tree to conduct constrained inferences, which lead to better utility. Our solution not only applies to general sequential data, but also can be seamlessly extended to trajectory data. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper to introduce a practical solution for publishing large volume of sequential data under differential privacy. We examine data utility in terms of two popular data analysis tasks conducted at the STM, namely count queries and frequent sequential pattern mining. Extensive experiments on real-life STM datasets confirm that our approach maintains high utility and is scalable to large datasets.", "citation": "Citations (146)", "departments": ["Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Societe de tran ... eal, PQ, Canada"], "authors": ["Rui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Rui", "Benjamin C.
