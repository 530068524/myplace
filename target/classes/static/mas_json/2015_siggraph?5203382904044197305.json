{"title": "RiSE: reflectance transformation imaging in spatial augmented reality for exhibition of cultural heritage.", "fields": ["exhibition", "polynomial texture mapping", "artificiality", "spite", "digitization"], "abstract": "Traditional museums have shown interest in exhibiting a meaningful representation of cultural heritage. However, existing stereotypical exhibition fails to attract the visitors' interest continuously as it provides only static and non-interactive contents and transmits information unilaterally. Recently, high performance measurement techniques have rapidly developed to a degree that allows for the realistic digitization of cultural heritage. Based on this digitized cultural heritage, dynamic and interactive content, such as 3D video and augmented reality, have been made to improve the immersion of visitors. In spite of these attempts, the sense of artificiality is still a challenge because most existing methods demonstrate their content via screen displays.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology", "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology", "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology", "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology", "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Yong Yi Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yong_Yi", "Junho Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Junho", "Yong Hwi Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Yong_Hwi", "Jong Hun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jong_Hun", "Moon Gu Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:Moon_Gu", "Bilal Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Bilal", "Kwan H.
