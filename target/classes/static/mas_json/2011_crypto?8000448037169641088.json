{"title": "Tor and Circumvention: Lessons Learned - (Abstract to Go with Invited Talk).", "fields": ["anonymity", "government", "china", "overlay network", "flatline"], "abstract": "Tor is a free-software anonymizing overlay network that helps people around the world use the Internet in safety. Tor\u2019s 2500 volunteer relays carry almost 10Gb/s of traffic for several hundred thousand users each day. While many in the research community know Tor as the primary fielded system in the anonymous communications literature [2], Tor has also played a central role in recent research on blocking resistance. That is, even if an anonymity system provides great anonymity, a government censor can render it moot by simply blocking the relays. In recent years we streamlined Tor\u2019s network communications to look more like ordinary SSL, and we introduced \u201cbridge relays\u201d that are harder for an attacker to find and block than Tor\u2019s public relays [1]. Tor played a key role in several Middle Eastern countries in early 2011. In this talk I\u2019ll walk the audience through how Iran used its Nokia DPI boxes to filter SSL flows that used Tor\u2019s original Diffie-Hellman parameter p; the surge in Tor traffic when Egypt blocked Facebook and the flatline when they unplugged the net; the continued bad news for Libya\u2019s Internet; and an intriguing trend in Saudi Arabia. I\u2019ll also cover current trends in China and Tunisia (not pictured).", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["The Tor Project"], "authors": ["Roger Dingledine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dingledine:Roger"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2011", "pages": 2}
