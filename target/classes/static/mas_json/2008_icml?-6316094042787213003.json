This is done in a rigorous fashion by generalizing three components of BFGS to subdifferentials: The local quadratic model, the identification of a descent direction, and the Wolfe line search conditions. We apply the resulting subLBFGS algorithm to  L  2 -regularized risk minimization with binary hinge loss, and its direction-finding component to  L  1 -regularized risk minimization with logistic loss. In both settings our generic algorithms perform comparable to or better than their counterparts in specialized state-of-the-art solvers.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jin Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jin", "S.
