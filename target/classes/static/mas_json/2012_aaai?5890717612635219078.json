Many of these phenomena exhibit variations in both space and time and it is imperative to develop a deeper understanding of techniques that can model space-time dynamics accurately. In this paper we propose NOSTILL-GP - NOn-stationary Space TIme variable Latent Length scale GP, a generic non-stationary, spatio-temporal Gaussian Process (GP) model. We present several strategies, for efficient training of our model, necessary for real-world applicability. Extensive empirical validation is performed using three real-world environmental monitoring datasets, with diverse dynamics across space and time. Results from the experiments clearly demonstrate general applicability and effectiveness of our approach for applications in environmental monitoring.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology", "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology", "University of Sydney"], "authors": ["Sahil Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Sahil", "Amarjeet Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh_0001:Amarjeet", "Fabio Ramos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramos:Fabio"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
