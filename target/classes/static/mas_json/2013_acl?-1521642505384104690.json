No corpusbased method, however, has yet addressed QSD when incorporating the implicit universal of plurals and/or operators such as negation. In this paper we report early, though promising, results for automatic QSD when handling both phenomena. We also present a general model for learning to build partial orders from a set of pairwise preferences. We give ann logn algorithm for finding a guaranteed approximation of the optimal solution, which works very well in practice. Finally, we significantly improve the performance of the previous model using a rich set of automatically generated features.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mehdi Manshadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manshadi:Mehdi", "Daniel Gildea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gildea:Daniel", "James F.
