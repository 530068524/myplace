{"title": "Matching-CNN meets KNN: Quasi-parametric human parsing.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "smoothing", "convolutional neural network", "parametric statistics", "parsing"], "abstract": "Both parametric and non-parametric approaches have demonstrated encouraging performances in the human parsing task, namely segmenting a human image into several semantic regions (e.g., hat, bag, left arm, face). In this work, we aim to develop a new solution with the advantages of both methodologies, namely supervision from annotated data and the flexibility to use newly annotated (possibly uncommon) images, and present a quasi-parametric human parsing model. Under the classic K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)-based nonparametric framework, the parametric Matching Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) is proposed to predict the matching confidence and displacements of the best matched region in the testing image for a particular semantic region in one KNN image. Given a testing image, we first retrieve its KNN images from the annotated/manually-parsed human image corpus. Then each semantic region in each KNN image is matched with confidence to the testing image using M-CNN, and the matched regions from all KNN images are further fused, followed by a superpixel smoothing procedure to obtain the ultimate human parsing result. The M-CNN differs from the classic CNN [12] in that the tailored cross image matching filters are introduced to characterize the matching between the testing image and the semantic region of a KNN image. The cross image matching filters are defined at different convolutional layers, each aiming to capture a particular range of displacements. Comprehensive evaluations over a large dataset with 7,700 annotated human images well demonstrate the significant performance gain from the quasi-parametric model over the state-of-the-arts [29, 30], for the human parsing task.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Si Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Si", "Xiaodan Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Xiaodan", "Luoqi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Luoqi", "Xiaohui Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xiaohui", "Jianchao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jianchao", "Changsheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Changsheng", "Liang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Liang", "Xiaochun Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xiaochun", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng"], "pages": 9}
