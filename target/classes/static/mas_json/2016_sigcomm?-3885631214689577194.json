{"title": "ProjecToR: Agile Reconfigurable Data Center Interconnect.", "fields": ["data center", "exploit", "reconfigurability", "free space optical communication", "digital micromirror device"], "abstract": "We explore a novel, free-space optics based approach for building data center interconnects. It uses a digital micromirror device (DMD) and mirror assembly combination as a transmitter and a photodetector on top of the rack as a receiver (Figure 1). Our approach enables all pairs of racks to establish direct links, and we can reconfigure such links (i.e., connect different rack pairs) within 12 us. To carry traffic from a source to a destination rack, transmitters and receivers in our interconnect can be dynamically linked in millions of ways. We develop topology construction and routing methods to exploit this flexibility, including a flow scheduling algorithm that is a constant factor approximation to the offline optimal solution. Experiments with a small prototype point to the feasibility of our approach. Simulations using realistic data center workloads show that, compared to the conventional folded-Clos interconnect, our approach can improve mean flow completion time by 30-95% and reduce cost by 25-40%.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Monia Ghobadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghobadi:Monia", "Ratul Mahajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahajan:Ratul", "Amar Phanishayee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phanishayee:Amar", "Nikhil R.
