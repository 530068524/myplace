{"title": "Google Vizier: A Service for Black-Box Optimization.", "fields": ["cloud computing", "black box", "early stopping", "transfer of learning", "bayesian inference"], "abstract": "Any sufficiently complex system acts as a black box when it becomes easier to experiment with than to understand. Hence, black-box optimization has become increasingly important as systems have become more complex. In this paper we describe  Google Vizier , a Google-internal service for performing black-box optimization that has become the de facto parameter tuning engine at Google. Google Vizier is used to optimize many of our machine learning models and other systems, and also provides core capabilities to Google's Cloud Machine Learning  HyperTune  subsystem. We discuss our requirements, infrastructure design, underlying algorithms, and advanced features such as transfer learning and automated early stopping that the service provides.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Daniel Golovin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golovin:Daniel", "Benjamin Solnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solnik:Benjamin", "Subhodeep Moitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moitra:Subhodeep", "Greg Kochanski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kochanski:Greg", "John Karro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karro:John", "D.
