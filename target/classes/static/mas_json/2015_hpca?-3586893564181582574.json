Other processors better cope with superpages at the expense of using power-hungry and slow fully-associative TLBs. We consider alternate designs that allow all pages to freely share a single, power-efficient and fast set-associative TLB. We propose a prediction-guided multi-grain TLB design that uses a superpage prediction mechanism to avoid multiple lookups in the common case. In addition, we evaluate the previously proposed skewed TLB [1] which builds on principles similar to those used in skewed associative caches [2]. We enhance the original skewed TLB design by using page size prediction to increase its effective associativity. Our prediction-based multi-grain TLB design delivers more hits and is more power efficient than existing alternatives. The predictor uses a 32-byte prediction table indexed by base register values.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "IRISA/EMRIA, Rennes, France"], "authors": ["Misel-Myrto Papadopoulou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadopoulou:Misel=Myrto", "Xin Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Xin", "Andr\u00e9 Seznec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seznec:Andr=eacute=", "Andreas Moshovos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moshovos:Andreas"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
