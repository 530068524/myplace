Reliable cell tracking in time-lapse microscopic image sequences is important for modern biomedical research. Existing cell tracking methods are usually kept simple and use only a small number of features to allow for manual parameter tweaking or grid search. We propose a structured learning approach that allows to learn optimum parameters automatically from a training set. This allows for the use of a richer set of features which in turn affords improved tracking compared to recently reported methods on two public benchmark sequences.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing", "Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing"], "authors": ["Xinghua Lou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lou:Xinghua", "Fred A.
