{"title": "Annotation-Free and One-Shot Learning for Instance Segmentation of Homogeneous Object Clusters.", "fields": ["homogeneous", "real image", "one shot learning", "annotation", "solver"], "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for instance segmen- tation given an image of homogeneous object clus- ter (HOC). Our learning approach is one-shot be- cause a single video of an object instance is cap- tured and it requires no human annotation. Our in- tuition is that images of homogeneous objects can be effectively synthesized based on structure and illumination priors derived from real images. A novel solver is proposed that iteratively maximizes our structured likelihood to generate realistic im- ages of HOC. Illumination transformation scheme is applied to make the real and synthetic images share the same illumination condition. Extensive experiments and comparisons are performed to ver- ify our method. We build a dataset consisting of pixel-level annotated images of HOC. The dataset and code will be published with the paper.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Zheng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Zheng", "Ruiheng Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Ruiheng", "Jiaxu Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Jiaxu", "Cewu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Cewu", "Chi-Keung Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Chi=Keung"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
