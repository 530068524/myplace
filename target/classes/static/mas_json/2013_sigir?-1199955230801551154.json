In this paper, we compare flat and hierarchical phrase-based translation models for query translation. Both approaches yield significantly better results than either a token-based or a one-best translation baseline on standard test collections. The choice of model manifests interesting tradeoffs in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and model compactness.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Ferhan T\u00fcre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/T=uuml=re:Ferhan", "Jimmy J.
