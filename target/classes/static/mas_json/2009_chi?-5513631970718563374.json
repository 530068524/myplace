Troubling factor confounds and hence quantitative estimation errors result from this inconsistency. The problem, it is suggested, may be fixed if the equivocalness of the fractional expression D/W that appears on the right-hand side of Fitts' law equations is acknowledged. This two-degree-of-freedom expression can be taken to specify either D and W or the form F and the scale S of the movement task. The paper ends up with practical recommendations for the design of consistent Fitts' law experiments. In most cases eliminating one factor will allow a safer estimation of Fitts' law parameters, while simplifying the experimental work.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yves Guiard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guiard:Yves"], "pages": 10}
