{"title": "Style Tokens: Unsupervised Style Modeling, Control and Transfer in End-to-End Speech Synthesis.", "fields": ["text corpus", "speech synthesis", "expressivity", "end to end principle", "scalability"], "abstract": "In this work, we propose \"global style tokens\" (GSTs), a bank of embeddings that are jointly trained within Tacotron, a state-of-the-art end-to-end speech synthesis system. The embeddings are trained with no explicit labels, yet learn to model a large range of acoustic expressiveness. GSTs lead to a rich set of significant results. The soft interpretable \"labels\" they generate can be used to control synthesis in novel ways, such as varying speed and speaking style - independently of the text content. They can also be used for style transfer, replicating the speaking style of a single audio clip across an entire long-form text corpus. When trained on noisy, unlabeled found data, GSTs learn to factorize noise and speaker identity, providing a path towards highly scalable but robust speech synthesis.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Baidu"], "authors": ["Yuxuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuxuan", "Daisy Stanton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stanton:Daisy", "Yu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yu", "R.
