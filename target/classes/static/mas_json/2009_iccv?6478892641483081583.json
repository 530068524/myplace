{"title": "The One-Shot similarity kernel.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "positive definite kernel", "similarity measure", "classifier", "kernel method"], "abstract": "The One-Shot similarity measure has recently been introduced in the context of face recognition where it was used to produce state-of-the-art results. Given two vectors, their One-Shot similarity score reflects the likelihood of each vector belonging in the same class as the other vector and not in a class defined by a fixed set of \u201cnegative\u201d examples. The potential of this approach has thus far been largely unexplored. In this paper we analyze the One-Shot score and show that: (1) when using a version of LDA as the underlying classifier, this score is a Conditionally Positive Definite kernel and may be used within kernel-methods (e.g., SVM), (2) it can be efficiently computed, and (3) that it is effective as an underlying mechanism for image representation. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the One-Shot similarity score in a number of applications including multiclass identification and descriptor generation.", "citation": "Citations (117)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Open University of Israel", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Lior Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Lior", "Tal Hassner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassner:Tal", "Yaniv Taigman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taigman:Yaniv"], "pages": 6}
