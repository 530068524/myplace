These structures are akin to transition systems/Kripke structures, usually adopted in model checking, except that they distinguish (and hence allow to separately quantify) between the actions/moves of two antagonistic players. We show that using them we can implement solvers for several agent behavior synthesis problems.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["RMIT University", "Dipartimento di ... a, Roma, Italy", "Dipartimento di ... a, Roma, Italy", "Dipartimento di ... a, Roma, Italy"], "authors": ["Giuseppe De Giacomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giacomo:Giuseppe_De", "Paolo Felli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felli:Paolo", "Fabio Patrizi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patrizi:Fabio", "Sebastian Sardi\u00f1a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sardi=ntilde=a:Sebastian"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
