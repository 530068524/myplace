{"title": "Fully Proportional Representation as Resource Allocation: Approximability Results.", "fields": ["mathematical economics", "approximation algorithm", "proportional representation", "resource allocation", "voting"], "abstract": "We study the complexity of (approximate) winner determination under Monroe's and Chamberlin-Courant's multiwinner voting rules, where we focus on the total (dis)satisfaction of the voters (the utilitarian case) or the (dis)satisfaction of the worst-off voter (the egalitarian case). We show good approximation algorithms for the satisfaction-based utilitarian cases, and inapproximability results for the remaining settings.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Auckland", "AGH University, ...
