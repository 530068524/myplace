However, few set implementations offer range queries. Known techniques for augmenting data structures with range queries (or operations that can be used to build range queries) have numerous problems that limit their usefulness. For example, they impose high overhead or rely heavily on garbage collection. In this work, we show how to augment data structures with highly efficient range queries, without relying on garbage collection. We identify a property of epoch-based memory reclamation algorithms that makes them ideal for implementing range queries, and produce three algorithms, which use locks, transactional memory and lock-free techniques, respectively. Our algorithms are applicable to more data structures than previous work, and are shown to be highly efficient on a large scale Intel system.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Maya Arbel-Raviv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arbel=Raviv:Maya", "Trevor Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brown_0001:Trevor"], "pages": 14}
