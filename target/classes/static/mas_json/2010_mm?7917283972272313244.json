Video transcoding at the Retransmission Server not only reduces the channel change latency, but also reduces the duration and data size of the unicast burst stream used for rapid acquisition. We develop an analytical model to capture the fundamental trade-offs in this system. This model is then used to characterize the potential savings from transcoding the unicast stream. Analysis and simulation results show that the stream compression factor affects linearly the saving in the channel change latency, and superlinearly the saving in unicast burst duration (or data size).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Cisco Systems, Inc.", "Cisco Systems, Inc.", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Zhi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Zhi", "Ali C.
