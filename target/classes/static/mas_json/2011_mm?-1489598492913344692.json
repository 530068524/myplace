This paper proposes a simple and efficient approach to refine the local descriptors for vector quantization by embedding semantic information. The original local descriptors are integrated by a sequence of category-independent and category-dependent basis. Particularly, the category-dependent basis is learned by minimizing the joint loss minimization over local descriptors from different categories with a shared regularization penalty, which can be formulated as a linear programming problem. The transferred descriptors are further quantized and aggregated to the visual vocabulary. Experiments are performed on PASCAL VOC 2007 benchmark and the quantitative comparisons with several state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Yingbin Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yingbin", "Renzhong Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Renzhong", "Hong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hong", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
