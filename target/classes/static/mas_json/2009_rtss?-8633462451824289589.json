{"title": "On the Implementation of Global Real-Time Schedulers.", "fields": ["interrupt", "queue", "multiprocessing", "heap", "schedule"], "abstract": "An empirical study of implementation tradeoffs (choice of ready queue implementation, quantum-driven vs. event driven scheduling, and interrupt handling strategy) affecting global real-time schedulers, and in particular global EDF, is presented. This study, conducted using UNC\u2019s Linux-based LITMUSRT on Sun\u2019s Niagara platform, suggests that implementation tradeoffs can impact schedulability as profoundly as scheduling-theoretic tradeoffs. For most of the considered workloads, implementation scalability proved to not be a key limitation of global EDF on the considered platform. Further, a combination of a parallel heap, event-driven scheduling, and dedicated interrupt handling performed best for most workloads.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Bj\u00f6rn B.
