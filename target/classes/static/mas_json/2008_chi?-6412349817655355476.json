However, there are few formal methods for evaluating the usability of game interfaces. In this paper, we introduce a new set of heuristics that can be used to carry out usability inspections of video games. The heuristics were developed to help identify usability problems in both early and functional game prototypes. We developed the heuristics by analyzing PC game reviews from a popular gaming website, and the review set covered 108 different games and included 18 from each of 6 major game genres. We analyzed the reviews and identified twelve common classes of usability problems seen in games. We developed ten usability heuristics based on the problem categories, and they describe how common game usability problems can be avoided. A preliminary evaluation of the heuristics suggests that they help identify game-specific usability problems that can easily be overlooked otherwise.", "citation": "Citations (448)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Nevada, Las Vegas", "University of Saskatchewan", "Queen's University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christine Szentgyorgyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szentgyorgyi:Christine", "Michael A.
