As SPL development increasingly involves numerous large FMs, scalable modular techniques are required to manage their complexity. In this paper, we present a novel slicing technique that produces a projection of an FM, including constraints. The slicing allows SPL practitioners to find semantically meaningful decompositions of FMs and has been integrated into the FAMILIAR language.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Mathieu Acher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acher:Mathieu", "Philippe Collet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collet:Philippe", "Philippe Lahire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lahire:Philippe", "Robert B.
