{"title": "Taking a HIT: Designing around Rejection, Mistrust, Risk, and Workers' Experiences in Amazon Mechanical Turk.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "risk management", "public relations", "multimedia", "dispute resolution"], "abstract": "Online crowd labor markets often address issues of risk and mistrust between employers and employees from the employers' perspective, but less often from that of employees. Based on 437 comments posted by crowd workers (Turkers) on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) participation agreement, we identified work rejection as a major risk that Turkers experience. Unfair rejections can result from poorly-designed tasks, unclear instructions, technical errors, and malicious Requesters. Because the AMT policy and platform provide little recourse to Turkers, they adopt strategies to minimize risk: avoiding new and known bad Requesters, sharing information with other Turkers, and choosing low-risk tasks. Through a series of ideas inspired by these findings-including notifying Turkers and Requesters of a broken task, returning rejected work to Turkers for repair, and providing collective dispute resolution mechanisms-we argue that making reducing risk and building trust a first-class design goal can lead to solutions that improve outcomes around rejected work for all parties in online labor markets.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Brian James McInnis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McInnis:Brian_James", "Dan Cosley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cosley:Dan", "Chaebong Nam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nam:Chaebong", "Gilly Leshed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leshed:Gilly"], "pages": 12}
