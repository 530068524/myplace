{"title": "The Communication Complexity of Set-Disjointness with Small Sets and 0-1 Intersection.", "fields": ["open problem", "binary logarithm", "alice and bob", "communication complexity", "independent set"], "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the following communication complexity problem. It is a variant of the set-disjointness problem, denoted$\\PDISJ_{\\log N}$, where each of Alice and Bob gets as an input a subset of $[N]$ of size at most $\\log N$, with the promise that the intersection of the two subsets is of size at most $1$. We provide an almost tight lower bound of $\\tOmega(\\log^2 N)$ on the deterministic communication complexity of the problem. The main motivation for studying this problem comes from the so-called ''clique vs. independent-set'' problem, introduced by Yannakakis (1988). Proving an $\\Omega(\\log^2 N)$ lower bound on the communication complexity of the clique vs. independent-set problem for all graphs is a long standing open problem with various implications. Proving such a lower bound for {\\em random}graphs is also open. In such a graph, both the cliques and the independent sets are of size $O(\\log N)$ (and obviously their intersection is of size at most 1). Hence, our $\\tOmega(\\log^2 N)$lower bound for $\\PDISJ_{\\log N}$ can be viewed as a first step in this direction. Interestingly, we note that standard lower bound techniques cannot yield the desired lower bound. Hence, we develop a novel adversary argument that may find other applications.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Eyal Kushilevitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kushilevitz:Eyal", "Enav Weinreb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weinreb:Enav"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
