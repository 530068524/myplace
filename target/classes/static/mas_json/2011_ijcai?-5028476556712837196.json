That is, it is assumed that the state of the environment after an action has been executed will satisfy its postcondition.\n\nIn reality, however, such environments are rare: the actual execution of an action may fail, and the envisaged outcome is not met. We provide a conceptual framework for reasoning about success and failure of agents' behaviours. In particular, we propose a measure that reflects how \"good\" an environment is with respect to agent's capabilities and a given goal it might pursue. We also discuss which types of goals are worth pursuing, depending on the type of environment the agent is acting in.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "University of Luxembourg"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Peter Nov\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nov=aacute=k_0001:Peter", "Wojciech Jamroga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jamroga:Wojciech"], "pages": 6}
