{"title": "Practical Mitigations for Timing-Based Side-Channel Attacks on Modern x86 Processors.", "fields": ["implementation", "cache", "data flow analysis", "x86", "side channel attack"], "abstract": "This paper studies and evaluates the extent to which automated compiler techniques can defend against timing-based side-channel attacks on modern x86 processors. We study how modern x86 processors can leak timing information through side-channels that relate to control flow and data flow. To eliminate key-dependent control flow and key-dependent timing behavior related to control flow, we propose the use of if-conversion in a compiler backend, and evaluate a proof-of-concept prototype implementation. Furthermore, we demonstrate two ways in which programs that lack key-dependent control flow and key- dependent cache behavior can still leak timing information on modern x86 implementations such as the Intel Core 2 Duo, and propose defense mechanisms against them.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "departments": ["Ghent University", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Ghent University", "Ghent University"], "authors": ["Bart Coppens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coppens:Bart", "Ingrid Verbauwhede.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verbauwhede:Ingrid", "Koen De Bosschere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosschere:Koen_De", "Bjorn De Sutter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sutter:Bjorn_De"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2009", "pages": 16}
