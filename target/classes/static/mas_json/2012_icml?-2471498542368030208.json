We posit the observed data as generated from a linear combination of a sparse Gaussian Markov model (with a sparse precision matrix) and a sparse Gaussian independence model (with a sparse covariance matrix). We provide efficient methods for decomposition of the data into two domains, viz., Markov and independence domains. We characterize a set of sufficient conditions for identifiability and model consistency. Our decomposition method is based on a simple modification of the popular l1-penalized maximum-likelihood estimator (l1-MLE). We establish that our estimator is consistent in both the domains, i.e., it successfully recovers the supports of both Markov and independence models, when the number of samples n scales as n = \u03a9(d2 log p), where p is the number of variables and d is the maximum node degree in the Markov model. Our conditions for recovery are comparable to those of l1-MLE for consistent estimation of a sparse Markov model, and thus, we guarantee successful high-dimensional estimation of a richer class of models under comparable conditions. Our experiments validate these results and also demonstrate that our models have better inference accuracy under simple algorithms such as loopy belief propagation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Majid Janzamin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Janzamin:Majid", "Animashree Anandkumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anandkumar:Animashree"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
