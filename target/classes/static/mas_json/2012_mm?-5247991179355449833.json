{"title": "Towards indexing representative images on the web.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "graph", "image retrieval", "image analysis", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "Even after 20 years of research on real-world image retrieval, there is still a big gap between what search engines can provide and what users expect to see. To bridge this gap, we present an image knowledge base, ImageKB, a graph representation of structured entities, categories, and representative images, as a new basis for practical image indexing and search. ImageKB is automatically constructed via a both bottom-up and top-down, scalable approach that efficiently matches 2 billion web images onto an ontology with millions of nodes. Our approach consists of identifying duplicate image clusters from billions of images, obtaining a candidate set of entities and their images, discovering definitive texts to represent an image and identifying representative images for an entity. To date, ImageKB contains 235.3M representative images corresponding to 0.52M entities, much larger than the state-of-the-art alternative ImageNet that contains 14.2M images for 0.02M synsets. Compared to existing image databases, ImageKB reflects the distributions of both images on the web and users' interests, contains rich semantic descriptions for images and entities, and can be widely used for both text to image search and image to text understanding.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Micrososft Rese ...
