{"title": "Knocking on elders' door: investigating the functional and emotional geography of their domestic space.", "fields": ["domestic technology", "activities of daily living", "perception", "emotional geography", "pleasure"], "abstract": "The domestic environment is more than a place where to live. It is a territory of meaning, a place where pleasure, affect and aesthetics are deeply interwoven with the functional and utilitarian dimensions. With the aging process, the home is progressively invested with new meanings and functions, and becomes the emotional center of older people's life.   This paper presents a user study based on cultural probes on how domestic spaces are managed and perceived by older adults, uncovering some of the complex interrelations among the daily activities, objects and meanings revolving around the home. The findings provide suggestions on how the dimensions of remembrance, perception of safety and environmental stability may affect the design of domestic technology for elderly people.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["FBK-irst, Trento, Italy", "FBK-irst, Trento, Italy", "FBK-irst, Trento, Italy", "FBK-irst, Trento, Italy", "FBK-irst, Trento, Italy"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chiara Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Chiara", "Claudio Mennecozzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mennecozzi:Claudio", "Elena Not.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Not:Elena", "Fabio Pianesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pianesi:Fabio", "Massimo Zancanaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zancanaro:Massimo", "Francesca Gennai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gennai:Francesca", "Antonio Cristoforetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cristoforetti:Antonio"], "pages": 10}
