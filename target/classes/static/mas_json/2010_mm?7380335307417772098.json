We design three components to realize the system: script-face mapping, key-scene extraction, and cartoonization. Script-face mapping utilizes face recognition and tracking techniques to accomplish the mapping between character's faces and their scripts. Key-scene extraction combines the frames derived from subshots and the extracted index frames based on subtitle to select a sequence of frames for cartoonization. Finally, the cartoonization is accomplished via four steps: panel scale, stylization, word balloon placement and comics layout.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Akiira Media Sy ...
