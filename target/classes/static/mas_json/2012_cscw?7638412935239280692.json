{"title": "Participation in an online mathematics community: differentiating motivations to add.", "fields": ["mathoverflow", "online participation", "question answering", "ask price", "online community"], "abstract": "Why do people contribute content to communities of question-answering, such as Yahoo! Answers? We investigated this issue on MathOverflow, a site dedicated to research-level mathematics, in which users ask and answer questions. MathOverflow is the first in a growing number of specialized Q&A sites using the Stack Exchange platform for scientific collaboration. In this study we combine responses to a survey with collected data on posting behavior on the site. User behavior suggests that building reputation is an important incentive, even though users do not report this in the survey. Level of expertise affects users' reported motivation to help others, but does not affect the importance of reputation building. We discuss the implications for the design of communities to target and encourage more contributions.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Yla R.
