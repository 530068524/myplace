{"title": "The DBMS - your big data sommelier.", "fields": ["analytics", "data management", "sargable", "big data", "query optimization"], "abstract": "When addressing the problem of \u201cbig\u201d data volume, preparation costs are one of the key challenges: the high costs for loading, aggregating and indexing data leads to a long data-to-insight time. In addition to being a nuisance to the end-user, this latency prevents real-time analytics on \u201cbig\u201d data. Fortunately, data often comes in semantic chunks such as files that contain data items that share some characteristics such as acquisition time or location. A data management system that exploits this trait can significantly lower the data preparation costs and the associated data-to-insight time by only investing in the preparation of the relevant chunks. In this paper, we develop such a system as an extension of an existing relational DBMS (MonetDB). To this end, we develop a query processing paradigm and data storage model that are partial-loading aware. The result is a system that can make a 1.2 TB dataset (consisting of 4000 chunks) ready for querying in less than 3 minutes on a single server-class machine while maintaining good query processing performance.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica"], "authors": ["Yagiz Kargin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kargin:Yagiz", "Martin L.
