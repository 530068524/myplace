In this setting, there is a set of m machines and a set of n jobs, and each job j has a machine dependent processing time of p ij  on machine i. The flow-time of a job is the amount of time the job spends in a system (its completion time minus its arrival time), and is one of the most natural measure of quality of service. We show the following two results: an $O(min(log 2  n, log n log P)) approximation algorithm for minimizing the total flow-time, and an O(log n) approximation for minimizing the maximum flow-time. Here P is the ratio of maximum to minimum job size. These are the first known poly-logarithmic guarantees for both the problems.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Duke University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Nikhil Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Nikhil", "Janardhan Kulkarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulkarni:Janardhan"], "pages": 10}
