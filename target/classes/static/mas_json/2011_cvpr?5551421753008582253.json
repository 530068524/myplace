To support claims of KT w.r.t. scalability we thus advocate to evaluate KT in a large-scale setting. To this end, we provide an extensive evaluation of three popular approaches to KT on a recently proposed large-scale data set, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition 2010 data set. In a first setting they are directly compared to one-vs-all classification often neglected in KT papers and in a second setting we evaluate their ability to enable zero-shot learning. While none of the KT methods can improve over one-vs-all classification they prove valuable for zero-shot learning, especially hierarchical and direct similarity based KT. We also propose and describe several extensions of the evaluated approaches that are necessary for this large-scale study.", "citation": "Citations (213)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["MPI Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken", "MPI Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken", "MPI Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Marcus Rohrbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rohrbach:Marcus", "Michael Stark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stark_0003:Michael", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "pages": 8}
