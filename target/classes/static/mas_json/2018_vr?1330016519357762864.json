Our method is based on the Coulomb friction model, and we show how to efficiently implement it in a commodity VR engine for realtime performance. This model enables very convincing simulations of many types of actions such as pushing, pulling, grasping, or even dexterous manipulations such as spinning objects between fingers without restrictions on the objects' shapes or hand poses. Because it is an analytic model, we do not require any prerecorded data, in contrast to previous methods. For the evaluation of our method, we conduction a pilot study that shows that our method is perceived more realistic and natural, and allows for more diverse interactions. Further, we evaluate the computational complexity of our method to show real-time performance in VR environments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "authors": ["Markus H\u00f6ll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=ll:Markus", "Markus Oberweger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oberweger:Markus", "Clemens Arth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arth:Clemens", "Vincent Lepetit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepetit:Vincent"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
