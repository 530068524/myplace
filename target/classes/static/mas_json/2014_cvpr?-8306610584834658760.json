Specifically, we consider minimal problems where one of the cameras has no or known radial distortion. There are three useful cases for this setup with a single unknown distortion: (i) fundamental matrix estimation where the two cameras are uncalibrated, (ii) essential matrix estimation for a partially calibrated camera pair, (iii) essential matrix estimation for one calibrated camera and one camera with unknown focal length. We study the parameterization of these three problems and derive fast polynomial solvers based on Grobner basis methods. We demonstrate the numerical stability of the solvers on synthetic data. The minimal solvers have also been applied to real imagery with convincing results.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Lund University", "Lund University", "Lund University", "Lund University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yubin Kuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuang:Yubin", "Jan Erik Solem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solem:Jan_Erik", "Fredrik Kahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kahl:Fredrik", "Kalle \u00c5str\u00f6m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Aring=str=ouml=m:Kalle"], "pages": 8}
