While existing efforts have mainly focused on investigating user behaviors in traditional social network services (SNS), this paper aims to exploit individual behaviors in EBSNs, which remains an unsolved problem. In particular, our method predicts activity attendance by discovering a set of factors that connect the physical and cyber spaces and influence individual's attendance of activities in EBSNs. These factors, including content preference, context (spatial and temporal) and social influence, are extracted using different models and techniques. We further propose a novel Singular Value Decomposition with Multi-Factor Neighborhood (SVD-MFN) algorithm to predict activity attendance by integrating the discovered heterogeneous factors into a single framework, in which these factors are fused through a neighborhood set. Experiments based on real-world data from Douban Events demonstrate that the proposed SVD-MFN algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art prediction methods.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Microsoft", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University"], "authors": ["Rong Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Rong", "Zhiwen Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Zhiwen", "Tao Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Tao", "Zhitao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhitao", "Zhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhu", "Bin Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Bin"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
