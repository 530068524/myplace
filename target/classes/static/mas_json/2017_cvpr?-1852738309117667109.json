{"title": "Detecting Masked Faces in the Wild with LLE-CNNs.", "fields": ["face detection", "computer vision", "feature extraction", "pattern recognition", "embedding"], "abstract": "Detecting faces with occlusions is a challenging task due to two main reasons: 1) the absence of large datasets of masked faces, and 2) the absence of facial cues from the masked regions. To address these two issues, this paper first introduces a dataset, denoted as MAFA, with 30, 811 Internet images and 35, 806 masked faces. Faces in the dataset have various orientations and occlusion degrees, while at least one part of each face is occluded by mask. Based on this dataset, we further propose LLE-CNNs for masked face detection, which consist of three major modules. The Proposal module first combines two pre-trained CNNs to extract candidate facial regions from the input image and represent them with high dimensional descriptors. After that, the Embedding module is incorporated to turn such descriptors into a similarity-based descriptor by using locally linear embedding (LLE) algorithm and the dictionaries trained on a large pool of synthesized normal faces, masked faces and non-faces. In this manner, many missing facial cues can be largely recovered and the influences of noisy cues introduced by diversified masks can be greatly alleviated. Finally, the Verification module is incorporated to identify candidate facial regions and refine their positions by jointly performing the classification and regression tasks within a unified CNN. Experimental results on the MAFA dataset show that the proposed approach remarkably outperforms 6 state-of-the-arts by at least 15.6%.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shiming Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Shiming", "Jia Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jia", "Qiting Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Qiting", "Zhao Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Zhao"], "pages": 9}
