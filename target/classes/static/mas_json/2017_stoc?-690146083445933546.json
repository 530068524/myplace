{"title": "The menu-size complexity of revenue approximation.", "fields": ["bounded function", "existential quantification", "communication complexity", "common value auction", "revenue"], "abstract": "We consider a monopolist that is selling  n  items to a single additive buyer, where the buyer\u00e2  s values for the items are drawn according to independent distributions  F  1 , F  2 ,\u00e2 \ufffd, F   n   that possibly have unbounded support. It is well known that \u00e2   unlike in the single item case \u00e2   the revenue-optimal auction (a pricing scheme) may be complex, sometimes requiring a continuum of menu entries. It is also known that simple auctions with a finite bounded number of menu entries can extract a constant fraction of the optimal revenue. Nonetheless, the question of the possibility of extracting an arbitrarily high fraction of the optimal revenue via a finite menu size remained open.   In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this open question, showing that for every  n  and for every I\u00b5>0, there exists a complexity bound  C = C ( n ,I\u00b5) such that auctions of menu size at most  C  suffice for obtaining a (1\u00e2  I\u00b5) fraction of the optimal revenue from  any   F  1 ,\u00e2 \ufffd, F   n  . We prove upper and lower bounds on the revenue approximation complexity  C ( n ,I\u00b5), as well as on the deterministic communication complexity required to run an auction that achieves such an approximation.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Moshe Babaioff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babaioff:Moshe", "Yannai A.
