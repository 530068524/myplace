In this setting, we decompose the task of tracking into translation and scale estimation of objects. We show that the correlation between temporal context considerably improves the accuracy and reliability for translation estimation, and it is effective to learn discriminative correlation filters from the most confident frames to estimate the scale change. In addition, we train an online random fern classifier to re-detect objects in case of tracking failure. Extensive experimental results on large-scale benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.", "citation": "Citations (348)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "University of California, Merced"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma_0004:Chao", "Xiaokang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiaokang", "Chongyang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chongyang", "Ming-Hsuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Ming=Hsuan"], "pages": 9}
