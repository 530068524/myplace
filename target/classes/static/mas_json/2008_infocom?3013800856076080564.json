Before transmitting a frame on the downlink, an OFDMA base station has to invoke an algorithm that determines which of the pending packets will be transmitted, what modulation should be used for each of them, and how to construct the complex OFDMA frame matrix as a collection of rectangles that fit into a single matrix with fixed dimensions. We propose efficient, and theoretically best possible, algorithms that solves this intricate OFDMA scheduling problem by breaking it down into two sub-problems, referred to as macro and micro scheduling. We analyze the computational complexity of these sub-problems and develop efficient algorithms for solving them.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Reuven Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Reuven", "Liran Katzir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katzir_0001:Liran"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
