{"title": "Updating XML schemas and associated documents through exup.", "fields": ["document structure description", "document definition markup language", "xml schema", "relax ng"], "abstract": "Data on the Web mostly are in XML format and the need often arises to update their structure, commonly described by an XML Schema. When a schema is modified the effects of the modification on documents need to be faced. XSUpdate is a language that allows to easily identify parts of an XML Schema, apply a modification primitive on them and finally define an adaptation for associated documents, while E\u03c7up is the corresponding engine for processing schema modification and document adaptation statements. Purpose of this demonstration is to provide an overview of the facilities of the XSUpdate language and of the E\u03c7up system.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Milan", "DISI, Universit ... f Genova, Italy", "DISI, Universit ... f Genova, Italy"], "authors": ["Federico Cavalieri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cavalieri:Federico", "Giovanna Guerrini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerrini:Giovanna", "Marco Mesiti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mesiti:Marco"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
