{"title": "Abstract Preference Frameworks - a Unifying Perspective on Separability and Strong Equivalence.", "fields": ["machine learning", "equivalence", "rotation formalisms in three dimensions", "artificial intelligence", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "We introduce abstract preference frameworks to study general properties common across a variety of preference formalisms. In particular, we study strong equivalence in preference formalisms and their separability. We identify abstract postulates on preference frameworks, satisfied by most of the currently studied preference formalisms, that lead to characterizations of both properties of interest.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Calabria", "University of Kentucky", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Wolfgang Faber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faber_0001:Wolfgang", "Miroslaw Truszczynski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Truszczynski:Miroslaw", "Stefan Woltran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woltran:Stefan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
