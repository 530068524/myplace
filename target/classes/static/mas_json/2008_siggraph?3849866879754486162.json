In all these activities, an interface for robotic hand and arm manipulations is important to interact with the external environment [Bar-Cohen, 2000]. Conventional interfaces consist of a few levers and switches; unfortunately, such interfaces are difficult to control, and the users must have prior experience as far as the operation of these interfaces is concerned. The other type of interfaces reflects the postures of the user\u2019s hand and arm directly in the robotic hand and arm so that the robots are capable of intuitive manipulation. However, these devices have a trouble of wearing and restrict the hand size of the user.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Shuji Komeiji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komeiji:Shuji", "Katsunari Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Katsunari", "Kouta Minamizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minamizawa:Kouta", "Hideaki Nii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nii:Hideaki", "Naoki Kawakami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawakami:Naoki", "Susumu Tachi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tachi:Susumu"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2008", "pages": 1}
