{"title": "Distributed Optimal Datacenter Bandwidth Allocation for Dynamic Adaptive Video Streaming.", "fields": ["convergence", "distributed algorithm", "bandwidth allocation", "quality of experience", "bandwidth"], "abstract": "Video streaming systems such as YouTube and Netflix are usually supported by the content delivery networks and datacenters that can consume many megawatts of power. Most existing works independently study the issues of improving quality of experience (QoE) for viewers and reducing the cost and emissions associated with the enormous energy usage of datacenters. By contrast, this paper addresses them both, and jointly optimizes the QoE, the energy cost and emissions by intelligently allocating datacenter bandwidth among different client groups. Specially, we propose a distributed algorithm for achieving the optimal bandwidth allocation. The algorithm novelly decomposes the optimization process into separate ones, which are solved iteratively across datacenters and clients. We demonstrate its convergence by both theoretical proof and experimental validation. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm converges very fast and achieves much better QoE-cost balance than existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["McGill University", "East China University of Science and Technology", "McGill University", "McGill University", "Shang Hai Jiao  ...
