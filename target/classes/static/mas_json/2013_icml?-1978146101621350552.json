{"title": "Non-Linear Stationary Subspace Analysis with Application to Video Classification.", "fields": ["stationary subspace analysis", "statistical classification", "machine learning", "dimensionality reduction", "nonlinear system"], "abstract": "Low-dimensional representations are key to the success of many video classification algorithms. However, the commonly-used dimensionality reduction techniques fail to account for the fact that only part of the signal is shared across all the videos in one class. As a consequence, the resulting representations contain instance-specific information, which introduces noise in the classification process. In this paper, we introduce Non-Linear Stationary Subspace Analysis: A method that overcomes this issue by explicitly separating the stationary parts of the video signal (i.e., the parts shared across all videos in one class), from its non-stationary parts (i.e., specific to individual videos). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on action recognition, dynamic texture classification and scene recognition.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["NICTA", "University of Queensland", "NICTA", "NICTA", "University of Queensland", "NICTA"], "authors": ["Mahsa Baktashmotlagh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baktashmotlagh:Mahsa", "Mehrtash Tafazzoli Harandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harandi:Mehrtash_Tafazzoli", "Abbas Bigdeli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bigdeli:Abbas", "Brian C.
