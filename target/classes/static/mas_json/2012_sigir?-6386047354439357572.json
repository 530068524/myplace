Targeted  Twitter  stream is usually constructed by filtering tweets with user-defined selection criteria e.g. tweets published by users from a selected region, or tweets that match one or more predefined keywords. Targeted  Twitter  stream is then monitored to collect and understand users' opinions about the organizations. There is an emerging need for early crisis detection and response with such target stream. Such applications require a good named entity recognition (NER) system for  Twitter , which is able to automatically discover emerging named entities that is potentially linked to the crisis. In this paper, we present a novel 2-step unsupervised NER system for targeted  Twitter  stream, called TwiNER. In the first step, it leverages on the  global context  obtained from Wikipedia and Web N-Gram corpus to partition tweets into valid segments (phrases) using a dynamic programming algorithm. Each such tweet segment is a candidate named entity. It is observed that the named entities in the targeted stream usually exhibit a  gregarious  property, due to the way the targeted stream is constructed. In the second step, TwiNER constructs a random walk model to exploit the  gregarious  property in the  local context  derived from the  Twitter  stream. The highly-ranked segments have a higher chance of being true named entities. We evaluated TwiNER on two sets of real-life tweets simulating two targeted streams. Evaluated using labeled ground truth, TwiNER achieves comparable performance as with conventional approaches in both streams. Various settings of TwiNER have also been examined to verify our  global context + local context  combo idea.", "citation": "Citations (232)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Hewlett-Packard", "IBM", "Hewlett-Packard", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Chenliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chenliang", "Jianshu Weng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weng:Jianshu", "Qi He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Qi", "Yuxia Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Yuxia", "Anwitaman Datta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Datta:Anwitaman", "Aixin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Aixin", "Bu-Sung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Bu=Sung"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
