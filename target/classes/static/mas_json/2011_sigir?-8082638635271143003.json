In this paper, we build on earlier work of modeling temporal information. We propose an extension to the Query Likelihood Model that incorporates query-specific information to estimate rate parameters, and we introduce a temporal factor into language model smoothing and query expansion using pseudo-relevance feedback. We evaluate these extensions using a Twitter corpus and two newspaper article collections. Results suggest that, compared to prior approaches, our models are more effective at capturing the temporal variability of relevance associated with some topics.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory"], "authors": ["Miles Efron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efron:Miles", "Gene Golovchinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golovchinsky:Gene"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
