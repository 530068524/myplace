{"title": "Automatic workarounds for web applications.", "fields": ["failure detector", "transaction data", "web api", "workaround", "web modeling"], "abstract": "We present a technique that finds and executes workarounds for faulty Web applications automatically and at runtime. Automatic workarounds exploit the inherent redundancy of Web applications, whereby a functionality of the application can be obtained through different sequences of invocations of Web APIs. In general, runtime workarounds are applied in response to a failure, and require that the application remain in a consistent state before and after the execution of a workaround. Therefore, they are ideally suited for interactive Web applications, since those allow the user to act as a failure detector with minimal effort, and also either use read-only state or manage their state through a transactional data store. In this paper we focus on faults found in the access libraries of widely used Web applications such as Google Maps. We start by classifying a number of reported faults of the Google Maps and YouTube APIs that have known workarounds. From those we derive a number of general and API-specific program-rewriting rules, which we then apply to other faults for which no workaround is known. Our experiments show that workarounds can be readily deployed within Web applications, through a simple client-side plug-in, and that program-rewriting rules derived from elementary properties of a common library can be effective in finding valid and previously unknown workarounds.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Antonio Carzaniga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carzaniga:Antonio", "Alessandra Gorla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorla:Alessandra", "Nicol\u00f2 Perino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perino:Nicol=ograve=", "Mauro Pezz\u00e8.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pezz=egrave=:Mauro"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
