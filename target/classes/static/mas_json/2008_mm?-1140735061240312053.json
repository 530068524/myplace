One is the integration of both hierarchical and parallel structures that offer more flexibility and capacity of capturing the interaction between multiple Markov chains. The other is the incorporation of the segmental HMM that represents a variable-length sequence of observations. Especially, we develop a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to optimize model structures and model parameters simultaneously. The proposed MCSHMM is used for American football video analysis, where two semantics structures, play types and camera views, are involved. The experiment shows that the MCSHMM outperforms previous HMM-based approaches.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Oklahoma State University\u2013Stillwater", "Oklahoma State University\u2013Stillwater"], "authors": ["Yi Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Yi", "Guoliang Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Guoliang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
