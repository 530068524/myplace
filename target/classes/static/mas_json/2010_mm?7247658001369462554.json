In this work we utilise the SenseCam (a visual lifelogging tool), to investigate the predominant colours in one million minutes of human life that a group of 20 individuals encounter throughout their normal daily activities. We also compare the colours that different groups of people are exposed to in their typical days. This information is presented in using a novel colour-wheel visualisation which is a new means of illustrating that people are exposed to bright colours over longer durations of time during summer months, and more dark colours during winter months.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Dublin City University", "Dublin City University", "Dublin City University", "Dublin City University", "Dublin City University"], "authors": ["Philip Kelly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelly:Philip", "Aiden R.
