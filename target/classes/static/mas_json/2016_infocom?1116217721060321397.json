To optimize the data placement among distributed network locations is one of the fundamental problems, which aims at facilitating the data storage and access. However, traditional schemes meet challenges on the running time and the overhead introduced due to the increasing scale of datasets. Therefore, we propose a novel data placement scheme based on sketches to overcome these challenges. We first justify the effectiveness of applying the hypergraph sparsification on the data placement problem, and then present the method of constructing sparsifiers through the sketches of request traffic. Besides, the scheme features on the support of aggregating distributed sketches to make the decision and capturing the pattern of recent traffic through sliding windows. Finally, we obtain numerical results through simulations which confirm that the proposed scheme can place data effectively while reducing the introduced overhead in terms of algorithm running time, space and network traffic.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Victoria", "University of Victoria"], "authors": ["Boyang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Boyang", "Jianping Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan_0001:Jianping"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
