{"title": "Generating Diverse Plans Using Quantitative and Qualitative Plan Distance Metrics.", "fields": ["knowledge engineering", "management science", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Diversity-aware planning consists of generating multiple plans which, while solving the same problem, are dissimilar from one another. Quantitative plan diversity is domain-independent and does not require extensive knowledge-engineering effort, but can fail to reflect plan differences that are relevant to users. Qualitative plan diversity is based on domain-specific characteristics, thus being of greater practical value, but may require substantial knowledge engineering. We demonstrate a domain-independent diverse plan generation method that is based on customizable plan distance metrics and amenable to both quantitative and qualitative diversity. Qualitative plan diversity is obtained with minimal knowledge-engineering effort, using distance metrics which incorporate domain-specific content.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Lehigh University", "Lehigh University"], "authors": ["Alexandra Coman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coman:Alexandra", "Hector Mu\u00f1oz-Avila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mu=ntilde=oz=Avila:Hector"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
