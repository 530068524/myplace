{"title": "Mechanism Design and Implementation for Lung Exchange.", "fields": ["data set", "integer", "existential quantification", "np complete", "mechanism design"], "abstract": "We explore the mechanism design problem for lung exchange and its implementation in practice. We prove that determining whether there exists a non-trivial solution of the lung exchange problem is NP-complete. We propose a mechanism that is individually rational, strategy-proof and maximizes exchange size. To implement this mechanism in practice, we propose an algorithm based on Integer Linear Program and another based on search. Both of our algorithms for this mechanism yield excellent performances in simulated data sets.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Suiqian Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Suiqian", "Pingzhong Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Pingzhong"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
