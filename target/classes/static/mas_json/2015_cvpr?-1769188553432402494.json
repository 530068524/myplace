{"title": "A metric parametrization for trifocal tensors with non-colinear pinholes.", "fields": ["tensor", "trifocal tensor", "manifold", "riemannian manifold", "quotient"], "abstract": "The trifocal tensor, which describes the relation between projections of points and lines in three views, is a fundamental entity of geometric computer vision. In this work, we investigate a new parametrization of the trifocal tensor for calibrated cameras with non-colinear pinholes obtained from a quotient Riemannian manifold. We incorporate this formulation into state-of-the art methods for optimization on manifolds, and show, through experiments in pose averaging, that it produces a meaningful way to measure distances between trifocal tensors.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Spyridon Leonardos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardos:Spyridon", "Roberto Tron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tron:Roberto", "Kostas Daniilidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daniilidis:Kostas"], "pages": 9}
