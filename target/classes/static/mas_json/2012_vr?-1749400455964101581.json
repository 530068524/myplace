One is how human can know the fact that an interacting partner is human. Another is how non-communicative behaviour can become communicative. To answer these questions, we performed two experiments exploiting the idea of perceptual crossing experiments. As a result, we will show that the turn-taking structure supports humanlikeness and human communication in the primitive non-verbal interaction. Our results will be discussed with ambient interface technology.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Plymouth University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Hiroyuki Iizuka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iizuka:Hiroyuki", "Davide Marocco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marocco:Davide", "Hideyuki Ando.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ando:Hideyuki", "Taro Maeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maeda:Taro"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
