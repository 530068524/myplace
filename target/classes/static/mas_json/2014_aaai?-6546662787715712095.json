Our system explores an open-ended space of statistical models to discover a good explanation of a data set, and then produces a detailed report with figures and natural language text.\n\nOur approach treats unknown regression functions nonparametrically using Gaussian processes, which has two important consequences. First, Gaussian processes can model functions in terms of high-level properties (e.g. smoothness, trends, periodicity, changepoints). Taken together with the compositional structure of our language of models this allows us to automatically describe functions in simple terms. Second, the use of flexible nonparametric models and a rich language for composing them in an open-ended manner also results in state-of-the-art extrapolation performance evaluated over 13 real time series data sets from various domains.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["James Robert Lloyd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lloyd:James_Robert", "David K.
