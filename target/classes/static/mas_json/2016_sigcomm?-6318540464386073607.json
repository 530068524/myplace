Several efforts have argued that accurate throughput prediction can dramatically improve (1) initial bitrate selection for low startup delay and high initial resolution; (2) midstream bitrate adaptation for high QoE. However, prior ef- forts did not systematically quantify real-world throughput predictability or develop good prediction algorithms. To bridge this gap, this paper makes three key technical contributions: First, we analyze the throughput characteristics in a dataset with 20M+ sessions. We find: (a) Sessions sharing similar key features (e.g., ISP, region) present similar initial values and dynamical patterns; (b) There is a natural \u201cstateful\u201d dynamical behavior within a given session. Second, building on these insights, we develop CS2P, a better throughput prediction system. CS2P leverages data-driven approach to learn (a) clusters of similar sessions, (b) an initial throughput predictor, and (c) a Hidden-Markov-Model based midstream predictor modeling the stateful evolution of throughput. Third, we develop a prototype system and show by trace-driven simulation and real-world experiments that CS2P outperforms state-of-art by 40% and 50% median pre- diction error respectively for initial and midstream through- put and improves QoE by 14% over buffer-based adaptation algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "ICT/CAS", "ICT/CAS"], "authors": ["Yi Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0004:Yi", "Xiaoqi Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Xiaoqi", "Junchen Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Junchen", "Vyas Sekar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sekar:Vyas", "Fuyuan Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Fuyuan", "Nanshu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Nanshu", "Tao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tao", "Bruno Sinopoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinopoli:Bruno"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
