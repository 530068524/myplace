{"title": "ESBMC 5.0: an industrial-strength C model checker.", "fields": ["python", "data structure", "model checking", "pointer", "bounds checking"], "abstract": "ESBMC is a mature, permissively licensed open-source context-bounded model checker for the verification of single- and multi-threaded C programs. It can verify both predefined safety properties (e.g., bounds check, pointer safety, overflow) and user-defined program assertions automatically. ESBMC provides C++ and Python APIs to access internal data structures, allowing inspection and extension at any stage of the verification process. We discuss improvements over previous versions of ESBMC, including the description of new front- and back-ends, IEEE floating-point support, and an improved  k -induction algorithm.
