{"title": "Optimizing Multi-Class Spatio-Spectral Filters via Bayes Error Estimation for EEG Classification.", "fields": ["bayes error rate", "electroencephalography", "bayes theorem", "embedding", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The method of common spatio-spectral patterns (CSSPs) is an extension of common spatial patterns (CSPs) by utilizing the technique of delay embedding to alleviate the adverse effects of noises and artifacts on the electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. Although the CSSPs method has shown to be more powerful than the CSPs method in the EEG classification, this method is only suitable for two-class EEG classification problems. In this paper, we generalize the two-class CSSPs method to multi-class cases. To this end, we first develop a novel theory of multi-class Bayes error estimation and then present the multi-class CSSPs (MC-SSPs) method based on this Bayes error theoretical framework. By minimizing the estimated closed-form Bayes error, we obtain the optimal spatio-spectral filters of MCSSPs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the BCI competition 2005 data set. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the previous multi-class CSPs (MCSPs) methods in the EEG classification.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Southeast University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Wenming Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Wenming", "Zhouchen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zhouchen"], "pages": 9}
