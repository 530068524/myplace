{"title": "A Verified SAT Solver Framework with Learn, Forget, Restart, and Incrementality.", "fields": ["dpll algorithm", "algorithm", "hol", "correctness", "imperative programming", "boolean satisfiability problem", "proof assistant", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We developed a formal framework for CDCL conflict-driven clause learning in Isabelle/HOL. Through a chain of refinements, an abstract CDCL calculus is connected to a SAT solver expressed in a functional programming language, with total correctness guarantees. The framework offers a convenient way to prove metatheorems and experiment with variants. Compared with earlier SAT solver verifications, the main novelties are the inclusion of rules for forget, restart, and incremental solving and the application of refinement.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "VU University Amsterdam", "Max Planck Society", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Max Planck Society", "VU University Amsterdam", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jasmin Christian Blanchette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanchette:Jasmin_Christian", "Mathias Fleury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fleury:Mathias", "Christoph Weidenbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weidenbach:Christoph"], "pages": 5}
