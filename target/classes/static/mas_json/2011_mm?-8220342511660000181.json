Pairwise constraint propagation methods have previously been designed primarily for single modality data and cannot be directly applied to multi-modal data or a dataset with multiple representations. In this paper, we provide an effective solution to the multi-modal constraint propagation problem by decomposing it into a set of independent multi-graph based two-class label propagation subproblems which are then merged into a unified problem and solved by quadratic optimization. We also show that such a formulation yields a closed-form solution. Our approach allows the initial pairwise constraints to be propagated throughout the entire multi-modal dataset. The propagated constraints are further used to refine the similarities between the objects for subsequent clustering tasks. The proposed method has been tested in constrained clustering tasks on two real-life multi-modal image datasets and shown to achieve significant improvements with respect to the single modality methods.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "City University of Hong Kong", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Zhenyong Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Zhenyong", "Horace Ho-Shing Ip.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ip:Horace_Ho=Shing", "Hongtao Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hongtao", "Zhiwu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhiwu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
