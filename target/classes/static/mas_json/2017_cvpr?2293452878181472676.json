{"title": "From Zero-Shot Learning to Conventional Supervised Classification: Unseen Visual Data Synthesis.", "fields": ["real image", "cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition", "support vector machine", "semantics", "visualization"], "abstract": "Robust object recognition systems usually rely on powerful feature extraction mechanisms from a large number of real images. However, in many realistic applications, collecting sufficient images for ever-growing new classes is unattainable. In this paper, we propose a new Zero-shot learning (ZSL) framework that can synthesise visual features for unseen classes without acquiring real images. Using the proposed Unseen Visual Data Synthesis (UVDS) algorithm, semantic attributes are effectively utilised as an intermediate clue to synthesise unseen visual features at the training stage. Hereafter, ZSL recognition is converted into the conventional supervised problem, i.e. the synthesised visual features can be straightforwardly fed to typical classifiers such as SVM. On four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the benefit of using synthesised unseen data. Extensive experimental results manifest that our proposed approach significantly improve the state-of-the-art results.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "University of East Anglia", "University of East Anglia", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yang Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Yang", "Li Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0004:Li", "Ling Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao_0001:Ling", "Fumin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Fumin", "Guiguang Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Guiguang", "Jungong Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jungong"], "pages": 10}
