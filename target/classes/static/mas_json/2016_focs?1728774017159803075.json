Its associated XOR function is the two-party function F(x, y) = f(x xor y). We show that, up to polynomial factors, the deterministic communication complexity of F is equal to the parity decision tree complexity of f. This relies on a novel technique of entropy reduction for protocols, combined with existing techniques in Fourier analysis and additive combinatorics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Hamed Hatami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hatami:Hamed", "Kaave Hosseini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosseini:Kaave", "Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
