{"title": "Green Scheduling for Energy-Efficient Operation of Multiple Chiller Plants.", "fields": ["chiller boiler system", "building management system", "chiller", "coefficient of performance", "water chiller"], "abstract": "In large building systems, such as a university campus, the air-conditioning systems are commonly served by chiller plants, which contribute a large fraction of the total electricity consumption of the campuses. The power consumption of a chiller is highly affected by its Coefficient of Performance (COP), which is optimal when the chiller is operated at or near full load. For a chiller plant, its overall COP can be optimized by utilizing a Thermal Energy Storage (TES) and switching its operation between COP-optimal charging and discharging modes. However, uncoordinated mode switchings of chiller plants may cause temporally-correlated high electricity demand when multiple plants are charging their TES concurrently. In this paper, a GS approach, proposed in our previous work, is used to schedule the chiller plants to reduce their peak aggregate power demand while ensuring safe operation of the TES. We present a scheduling algorithm based on backward reach set computation of the TES dynamics. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated in a numerical simulation in Mat lab to be effective for reducing the peak power demand and the overall electricity cost.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Madhur Behl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Behl:Madhur", "Truong Nghiem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nghiem:Truong", "Rahul Mangharam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mangharam:Rahul"], "pages": 10}
