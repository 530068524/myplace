It captures reasoning patterns that are common in provable security, such as simulations and reductions. CIL is sound for the standard model, but also supports reasoning in the random oracle and other idealized models.   We illustrate the benefits of CIL by formally proving the security of the probabilistic signature scheme (PSS).", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["IMDEA", "University of Grenoble", "University of Victoria", "University of Grenoble", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Macau University of Science and Technology", "IMDEA", "University of Grenoble", "University of Grenoble"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Gilles Barthe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthe:Gilles", "Marion Daubignard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daubignard:Marion", "Bruce M.
