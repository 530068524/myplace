We prove that the log-Sobolev constant of any isotropic logconcave density in  R   n   with support of diameter  D  is \u03a9(1/ D ), resolving a question posed by Frieze and Kannan in 1997. This is asymptotically the best possible estimate and improves on the previous bound of \u03a9(1/ D  2 ) by Kannan-Lovasz-Montenegro. It follows that for any isotropic logconcave density, the ball walk with step size \u03b4=\u0398(1/\u221a n ) mixes in  O  * ( n  2  D ) proper steps from any starting point. This improves on the previous best bound of  O  * ( n  2  D  2 ) and is also asymptotically tight. The new bound leads to the following refined large deviation inequality for an  L -Lipschitz function g over an isotropic logconcave density  p : for any  t >0, [complex formula not displayed]    where \u1e21 is the median or mean of  g  for  x \u223c  p ; this improves on previous bounds by Paouris and by Guedon-Milman. Our main proof is based on stochastic localization together with a Stieltjes-type barrier function.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yin Tat Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yin_Tat", "Santosh S.
