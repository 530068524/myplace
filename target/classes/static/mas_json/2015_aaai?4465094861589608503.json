{"title": "Optimizing the CVaR via Sampling.", "fields": ["conditional expectation", "cvar", "stochastic gradient descent", "risk measure", "expected shortfall"], "abstract": "Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is a prominent risk measure that is being used extensively in various domains. We develop a new formula for the gradient of the CVaR in the form of a conditional expectation. Based on this formula, we propose a novel sampling-based estimator for the gradient of the CVaR, in the spirit of the likelihood-ratio method. We analyze the bias of the estimator, and prove the convergence of a corresponding stochastic gradient descent algorithm to a local CVaR optimum. Our method allows to consider CVaR optimization in new domains. As an example, we consider a reinforcement learning application, and learn a risk-sensitive controller for the game of Tetris.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Aviv Tamar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamar:Aviv", "Yonatan Glassner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glassner:Yonatan", "Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
