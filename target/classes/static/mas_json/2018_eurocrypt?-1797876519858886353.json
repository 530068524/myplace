This is one of the most successful and well-studied models in cryptography. However, being such a strong idealized model, it is known to be susceptible to various weaknesses when implemented naively in \u201creal-life\u201d, as shown by Canetti, Goldreich and Halevi (J. ACM 2004).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Ilan Komargodski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komargodski:Ilan", "Eylon Yogev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yogev:Eylon"], "pages": 21}
