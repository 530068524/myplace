{"title": "Enhanced Automation for Managing Model and Metamodel Inconsistency.", "fields": ["model driven architecture", "software mining", "object oriented modeling", "metacomputing", "notation"], "abstract": "Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) introduces additional challenges for managing evolution. For example, a metamodel change may affect instance models. Existing tool supported approaches for updating models in response to a metamodel change assume extra effort from metamodel developers. When no existing approach is applicable, metamodel users must update their models manually, an error prone and tedious task. In this paper, we describe the technical challenges faced when using the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and existing approaches for updating models in response to a metamodel change. We then motivate and describe alternative techniques, including: a mechanism for loading, storing and mainpulating inconsistent models; a mapping of inconsistent models to a human-usable notation for semi-automated and collaborative co-evolution; and integration with an inter-model reference manager, achieving automatic consistency checking as part of metamodel distribution.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of York", "University of York", "University of York", "University of York"], "authors": ["Louis M.
