Our method is evaluated in the context of image-to-LaTeX generation, and we introduce a new dataset of real-world rendered mathematical expressions paired with LaTeX markup. We show that unlike neural OCR techniques using CTC-based models, attention-based approaches can tackle this non-standard OCR task. Our approach outperforms classical mathematical OCR systems by a large margin on in-domain rendered data, and, with pretraining, also performs well on out-of-domain handwritten data. To reduce the inference complexity associated with the attention-based approaches, we introduce a new coarse-to-fine attention layer that selects a support region before applying attention.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yuntian Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Yuntian", "Anssi Kanervisto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanervisto:Anssi", "Jeffrey Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Jeffrey", "Alexander M.
