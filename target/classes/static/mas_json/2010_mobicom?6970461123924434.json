In this paper, we present  Hermes  1 , a point-to-point data connectivity solution that works by modulating data onto acoustic signals that are sent over a cellular voice call. The main challenge is that most voice codecs greatly distort signals that are not  voice-like ; furthermore, the backhaul can be highly heterogeneous and of low quality, thereby introducing unpredictable distortions.  Hermes  modulates data over the extremely narrow-band approximately 3kHz bandwidth) acoustic carrier, while being severely constrained by the requirement that the resulting sound signals are voice-like, as far as the voice codecs are concerned.  Hermes  uses a robust data transcoding and modulation scheme to detect and correct errors in the face of bit flips, insertions and deletions; it also adapts the modulation parameters to the observed bit error rate on the actual voice channel. Through real-world experiments, we show that  Hermes  achieves approximately 1.2 kbps goodput which when compared to SMS, improves throughput by a factor of 5\u00d7 and reduces the cost-per-byte by over a factor of 50x", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "authors": ["Aditya Dhananjay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhananjay:Aditya", "Ashlesh Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Ashlesh", "Michael Paik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paik:Michael", "Jay Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jay", "Trishank Karthik Kuppusamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuppusamy:Trishank_Karthik", "Jinyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Jinyang", "Lakshminarayanan Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Lakshminarayanan"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
