We then prove that swap-or-not has excellent quantitative security bounds, giving a Luby-Rackoff type result that ensures security assuming an ideal round function to a number of adversarial queries that is nearly the size of the construction's domain. Swap-or-not provides a direct solution for building a small-domain cipher and achieving format-preserving encryption, yielding the best bounds known for a practical scheme for enciphering credit-card numbers. The analysis of swap-or-not is based on the theory of mixing times of Markov chains.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Viet Tung Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Viet_Tung", "Ben Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Ben", "Phillip Rogaway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogaway:Phillip"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 13}
