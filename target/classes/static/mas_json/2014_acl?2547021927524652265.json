{"title": "Metaphor Detection with Cross-Lingual Model Transfer.", "fields": ["bilingual dictionary", "syntax", "expression", "natural language processing", "metaphor"], "abstract": "We show that it is possible to reliably discriminate whether a syntactic construction is meant literally or metaphorically using lexical semantic features of the words that participate in the construction. Our model is constructed using English resources, and we obtain state-of-the-art performance relative to previous work in this language. Using a model transfer approach by pivoting through a bilingual dictionary, we show our model can identify metaphoric expressions in other languages. We provide results on three new test sets in Spanish, Farsi, and Russian. The results support the hypothesis that metaphors are conceptual, rather than lexical, in nature.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "INESC-ID", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yulia Tsvetkov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsvetkov:Yulia", "Leonid Boytsov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boytsov:Leonid", "Anatole Gershman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gershman:Anatole", "Eric Nyberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nyberg:Eric", "Chris Dyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dyer:Chris"], "pages": 11}
