{"title": "Automating the Implementation of Analysis Concerns in Workflow Applications.", "fields": ["workflow application", "workflow technology", "xpdl", "windows workflow foundation", "workflow engine"], "abstract": "In workflow management systems, analysis concerns related to monitoring, measurement, and control aim at identifying potential improvements of workflow applications. However, the specification of analysis concerns is done using a specific workflow language and engine, producing entangled code which is detrimental to their maintainability. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it presents briefly a domain-specific language to specify analysis concerns, independently of any workflow technology and in a modularized way. Second, it shows a strategy to assist developers to enhance a given workflow technology to support the automated implementation of analysis concerns into its workflow applications. Thus, given a workflow application and its analysis concerns, they are automatically integrated producing an enhanced executable workflow application.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["VU University Amsterdam", "TICSw Res.
