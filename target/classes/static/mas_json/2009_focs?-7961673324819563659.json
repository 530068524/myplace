Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(m d log n) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m ~ n and d ~ log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(n log^2 n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web-site of a large online retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400,000 vertices and 2 million edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.", "citation": "Citations (5,067)", "departments": ["University of New Mexico", "University of Michigan", "University of New Mexico", "National Institutes of Health", "National Institutes of Health", "National Institutes of Health", "University of Konstanz", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Cornell University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Cornell University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Princeton University", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Jeff Cheeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheeger:Jeff", "Bruce Kleiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kleiner:Bruce", "Assaf Naor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naor:Assaf"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
