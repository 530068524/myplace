However, performance and energy consumption limitations make the execution of such computationally intensive algorithms on mobile devices prohibitive. We present a GPU-accelerated library, dubbed CNNdroid [1], for execution of trained deep CNNs on Android-based mobile devices. Empirical evaluations show that CNNdroid achieves up to 60X speedup and 130X energy saving on current mobile devices. The CNNdroid open source library is available for download at https://github.com/ENCP/CNNdroid", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Sharif University of Technology", "Sharif University of Technology", "Sharif University of Technology", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Seyyed Salar Latifi Oskouei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oskouei:Seyyed_Salar_Latifi", "Hossein Golestani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golestani:Hossein", "Matin Hashemi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hashemi:Matin", "Soheil Ghiasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghiasi:Soheil"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 5}
