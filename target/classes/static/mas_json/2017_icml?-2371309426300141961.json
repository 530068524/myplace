{"title": "DARLA: Improving Zero-Shot Transfer in Reinforcement Learning.", "fields": ["open problem", "domain adaptation", "feature learning", "reinforcement learning", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Domain adaptation is an important open problem in deep reinforcement learning (RL). In many scenarios of interest data is hard to obtain, so agents may learn a source policy in a setting where data is readily available, with the hope that it generalises well to the target domain. We propose a new multi-stage RL agent, DARLA (DisentAngled Representation Learning Agent), which learns to see before learning to act. DARLA's vision is based on learning a disentangled representation of the observed environment. Once DARLA can see, it is able to acquire source policies that are robust to many domain shifts - even with no access to the target domain. DARLA significantly outperforms conventional baselines in zero-shot domain adaptation scenarios, an effect that holds across a variety of RL environments (Jaco arm, DeepMind Lab) and base RL algorithms (DQN, A3C and EC).", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "VU University Amsterdam", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Irina Higgins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Higgins:Irina", "Arka Pal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pal:Arka", "Andrei A.
