{"title": "A technical demonstration of large-scale image object retrieval by efficient query evaluation and effective auxiliary visual feature discovery.", "fields": ["bag of words model", "inverted index", "visual word", "query expansion", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "In this demonstration, we present a real-time system that addresses three essential issues of large-scale image object retrieval: 1) image object retrieval-facilitating pseudo-objects in inverted indexing and novel object-level pseudo-relevance feedback for retrieval accuracy; 2) time efficiency-boosting the time efficiency and memory usage of object-level image retrieval by a novel inverted indexing structure and efficient query evaluation; 3) recall rate improvement--mining semantically relevant auxiliary visual features through visual and textual clusters in an unsupervised and scalable (i.e., MapReduce) manner. We are able to search over one-million image collection in respond to a user query in 121ms, with significantly better accuracy (+99%) than the traditional bag-of-words model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Yin-Hsi Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Yin=Hsi", "Yi-Lun Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yi=Lun", "Kuan-Ting Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Kuan=Ting", "Yi-Hsuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yi=Hsuan", "Tzu-Hsuan Chiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiu:Tzu=Hsuan", "Winston H.
