Much HCI research begins with an investigatory and analytic ethnographic approach before translating to design. Design may come much later in the process and may never benefit the community that is researched. However in many settings it is difficult for researchers to access the privileged ethnographer position of observer and investigator. Moreover rapid ethnographic research often does not seem the best or most appropriate course of action. We draw upon a project working with a remote Australian Aboriginal community to illustrate an alternative approach in Indigenous research, where the notion of reciprocity is first and foremost. We argue that this can lead to sustainable designs, valid research and profound innovation.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Margot Brereton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brereton:Margot", "Paul Roe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roe:Paul", "Ronald Schroeter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schroeter:Ronald", "Anita Lee Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Anita_Lee"], "pages": 4}
