{"title": "SHRIMP: solving collision and out of vocabulary problems in mobile predictive input with motion gesture.", "fields": ["camera phone", "predictive text", "gesture", "keypad", "collision"], "abstract": "Dictionary-based disambiguation (DBD) is a very popular solution for text entry on mobile phone keypads but suffers from two problems: 1. the resolution of encoding collision (two or more words sharing the same numeric key sequence) and 2. entering out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In this paper, we present SHRIMP, a system and method that addresses these two problems by integrating DBD with camera based motion sensing that enables the user to express preference through a tilting or movement gesture. SHRIMP (Small Handheld Rapid Input with Motion and Prediction) runs on camera phones equipped with a standard 12-key keypad. SHRIMP maintains the speed advantage of DBD driven predictive text input while enabling the user to overcome DBD collision and OOV problems seamlessly without even a mode switch. An initial empirical study demonstrates that SHRIMP can be learned very quickly, performed immediately faster than MultiTap and handled OOV words more efficiently than DBD.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "IBM", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jingtao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingtao", "Shumin Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Shumin", "John F.
