We co-design the control law and the task scheduling algorithm for predictable performance and power consumption for both the computing and the physical systems. We use a typical example, multiple inverted pendulums controlled by one processor, to illustrate our method.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Fumin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Fumin", "Klementyna Szwaykowska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szwaykowska:Klementyna", "Wayne H.
