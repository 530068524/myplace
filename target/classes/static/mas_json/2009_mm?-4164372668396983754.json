Two multi-modal automatic scene segmentation techniques are proposed, both building upon the Scene Transition Graph (STG). In the first of the proposed approaches, speaker diarization results are used for introducing a post-processing step to the STG construction algorithm, with the objective of discarding scene boundaries erroneously identified according to visual-only dissimilarity. In the second approach, speaker diarization and additional audio analysis results are employed and a separate audio-based STG is constructed, in parallel to the original STG based on visual information. The two STGs are subsequently combined. Preliminary results from the application of the proposed techniques to broadcast videos reveal their improved performance over previous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Technical University of Lisbon", "Technical University of Lisbon", "Centre for Rese ... aloniki, Greece", "Centre for Rese ... aloniki, Greece", "Centre for Rese ... aloniki, Greece"], "authors": ["Panagiotis Sidiropoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sidiropoulos:Panagiotis", "Vasileios Mezaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mezaris:Vasileios", "Ioannis Kompatsiaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kompatsiaris:Ioannis", "Hugo Meinedo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meinedo:Hugo", "Isabel Trancoso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trancoso:Isabel"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
