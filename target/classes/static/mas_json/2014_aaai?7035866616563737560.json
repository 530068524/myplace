{"title": "Spectral Thompson Sampling.", "fields": ["effective dimension", "recommender system", "time horizon", "thompson sampling", "regret"], "abstract": "Thompson Sampling (TS) has surged a lot of interest due to its good empirical performance, in particular in the computational advertising. Though successful, the tools for its performance analysis appeared only recently. In this paper, we describe and analyze SpectralTS algorithm for a bandit problem, where the payoffs of the choices are smooth given an underlying graph. In this setting, each choice is a node of a graph and the expected payoffs of the neighboring nodes are assumed to be similar. Although the setting has application both in recommender systems and advertising, the traditional algorithms would scale poorly with the number of choices. For that purpose we consider an effective dimension d, which is small in real-world graphs. We deliver the analysis showing that the regret of SpectralTS scales as d\u221aT ln N with high probability, where T is the time horizon and N is the number of choices. Since a d\u221aT ln N regret is comparable to the known results, SpectralTS offers a computationally more efficient alternative. We also show that our algorithm is competitive on both synthetic and real-world data.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s Koc\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koc=aacute=k:Tom=aacute=s", "Michal Valko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valko:Michal", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi", "Shipra Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal_0001:Shipra"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
