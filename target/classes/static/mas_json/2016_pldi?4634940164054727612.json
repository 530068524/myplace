{"title": "Cartesian hoare logic for verifying k-safety properties.", "fields": ["transitive relation", "relational operator", "associative property", "hoare logic", "separation logic"], "abstract": "Unlike safety properties which require the absence of a \u201cbad\u201d program trace, k-safety properties stipulate the absence of a \u201cbad\u201d interaction between k traces. Examples of k-safety properties include transitivity, associativity, anti-symmetry, and monotonicity. This paper presents a sound and relatively complete calculus, called Cartesian Hoare Logic (CHL), for verifying k-safety properties. We also present an automated verification algorithm based on CHL and implement it in a tool called DESCARTES. We use DESCARTES to analyze user-defined relational operators in Java and demonstrate that DESCARTES is effective at verifying (or finding violations of) multiple k-safety properties.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Marcelo Sousa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sousa:Marcelo", "Isil Dillig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillig:Isil"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
