In this paper, we present a system for making pairings and present results from two deployments. Results show that members used pair research in a wide variety of ways including pair programming, user testing, brainstorming, and data collection and analysis. Pair research helped members get things done and share their expertise with others.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Northwestern University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Robert C.
