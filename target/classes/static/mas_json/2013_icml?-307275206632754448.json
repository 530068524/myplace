One natural method using convex optimization is to solve the following problem: min \u03b8 1/2||\u03a6\u03b8 - c||2 + \u03bb||D\u03b8||1. This paper provides an upper bound of the estimate error and shows the consistency property of this method by assuming that the design matrix \u03a6 is a Gaussian random matrix. Specifically, we show 1) in the noiseless case, if the condition number of D is bounded and the measurement number n \u2265 \u03a9(s log(p)) where s is the sparsity number, then the true solution can be recovered with high probability; and 2) in the noisy case, if the condition number of D is bounded and the measurement increases faster than s log(p), that is, s log(p) = o(n), the estimate error converges to zero with probability 1 when p and s go to infinity. Our results are consistent with those for the special case D = Ip\u00d7p (equivalently LASSO) and improve the existing analysis. The condition number of D plays a critical role in our analysis. We consider the condition numbers in two cases including the fused LASSO and the random graph: the condition number in the fused LASSO case is bounded by a constant, while the condition number in the random graph case is bounded with high probability if m/p (i.e., #edge/#vertex) is larger than a certain constant. Numerical simulations are consistent with our theoretical results.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Ji Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Ji", "Lei Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan_0001:Lei", "Jieping Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jieping"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
