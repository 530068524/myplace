We instead focus on embodied conversational agents (ECAs). ECAs occupy the virtual environment as interactive partners. We propose that the ECA analogues of immersion and presence are physicality and social presence. We performed a study to determine the effect of an ECA's physicality on social presence and eliciting realistic behavior from the user. The results showed that increasing physicality can elicit realistic behavior and increase social presence but there was also an interaction effect with plausibility.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Joon Hao Chuah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuah:Joon_Hao", "Andrew Robb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robb:Andrew", "Casey White.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/White:Casey", "Adam Wendling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wendling:Adam", "Samsun (Sem) Lampotang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampotang:Samsun_=Sem=", "Regis Kopper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopper:Regis", "Benjamin Lok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lok:Benjamin"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
