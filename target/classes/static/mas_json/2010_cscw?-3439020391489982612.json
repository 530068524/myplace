Physical height is known to influence dominance in interactions between people. This study explores how audio projection technologies also influence dominance behaviors between people. In an exploratory 2 (between-participants: own voice location set spatially high vs. low) x 2 (within-participants: voice agent set spatially high vs. low) mixed-design experiment (N=64), we investigated the psychological effects of voice location upon collaborative decision-making interactions between people and voice agents. We found evidence that suggests the dominating effects of project voices' coming from above can be mitigated by hearing one's own voice projected from above.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Willow Garage", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Leila Takayama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takayama:Leila", "Clifford Nass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nass:Clifford"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
