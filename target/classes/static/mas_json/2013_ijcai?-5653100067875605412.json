{"title": "Analysis and Optimization of Multi-Dimensional Percentile Mechanisms.", "fields": ["mechanism design", "prior probability", "percentile", "facility location problem", "social cost"], "abstract": "We consider the mechanism design problem for agents with single-peaked preferences over multi-dimensional domains when multiple alternatives can be chosen. Facility location and committee selection are classic embodiments of this problem. We propose a class of percentile mechanisms, a form of generalized median mechanisms, that are strategy-proof, and derive worst-case approximation ratios for social cost and maximum load for L1 and L2 cost models. More importantly, we propose a sample-based framework for optimizing the choice of percentiles relative to any prior distribution over preferences, while maintaining strategy-proofness. Our empirical investigations, using social cost and maximum load as objectives, demonstrate the viability of this approach and the value of such optimized mechanisms vis-a-vis mechanisms derived through worst-case analysis.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xin Sui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sui:Xin", "Craig Boutilier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boutilier:Craig", "Tuomas Sandholm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sandholm:Tuomas"], "pages": 8}
