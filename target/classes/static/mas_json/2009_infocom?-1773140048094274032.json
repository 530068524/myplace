{"title": "Scaling Laws on Multicast Capacity of Large Scale Wireless Networks.", "fields": ["scaling", "special case", "throughput", "attenuation", "multicast"], "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the networking-theoretic multicast capacity for both random extended networks (REN) and random dense networks (RDN) under Gaussian Channel model, when all nodes are individually power-constrained. During the transmission, the power decays along path with the attenuation exponent alpha > 2. In REN and RDN, n nodes are randomly distributed in the square region with side-length radic(n) and 1, respectively. We randomly choose n s  nodes as the sources of multicast sessions, and for each source v, we pick uniformly at random n d  nodes as the destination nodes. Based on percolation theory, we propose multicast schemes and analyze the achievable throughput by considering all possible values of n s  and n d . As a special case of our results, we show that for n s  = Theta(n), the per-session multicast capacity of RDN is Theta((1)/(radic(n d n))) when n d  = O((n)/((log n) 3 )) and is Theta((1)/(n)) when n d  = Omega((1)/(log n)); the per-session multicast capacity of REN is Theta((1)/radic(n d n)) when n d  = O((n)/((log n) alpha+1 )) and is Theta((1)/(n d ) ldr (log n) -(alpha)/(2) ) when n d  = Omega((n)/(log n)).", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Tongji University", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Tongji University", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Cheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Cheng", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Changjun Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Changjun", "Shaojie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shaojie", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao", "Jizhong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Jizhong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
