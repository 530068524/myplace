Our framework is based on learning a binary code based representation for objects in each modality, and has the following key properties: (i) it can leverage both pairwise as well as easy-to-obtain relative preference based cross-modal constraints, (ii) the probabilistic framework naturally allows querying for the most useful/informative constraints, facilitating an active learning setting (existing methods for cross-modal similarity learning do not have such a mechanism), and (iii) the binary code length is learned from the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two problems that require computing pairwise similarities between cross-modal object pairs: cross-modal link prediction in bipartite graphs, and hashing based cross-modal similarity search.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Duke University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Yi Zhen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhen:Yi", "Piyush Rai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rai:Piyush", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
