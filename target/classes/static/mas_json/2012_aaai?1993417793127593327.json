{"title": "Effects of Representation on Solving Complex Spatial-Temporal Problems.", "fields": ["spacetime", "machine learning", "spatial temporal reasoning", "coupling", "conflation"], "abstract": "Human data are used to study how people solve complex problems that have spatial and temporal components. Major findings include the use of task-focused representations, unexpectedly tight coupling of representation and search, time and space conflation, and use of multiple concurrent representations. The major contributions of this work include a set of abstract representations that strongly support spatial-temporal reasoning.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Baylor Wetzel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wetzel:Baylor"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
