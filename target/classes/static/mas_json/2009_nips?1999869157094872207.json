{"title": "Generalization Errors and Learning Curves for Regression with Multi-task Gaussian Processes.", "fields": ["gaussian process", "machine learning", "learning curve", "generalization error", "sampling"], "abstract": "We provide some insights into how task correlations in multi-task Gaussian process (GP) regression affect the generalization error and the learning curve. We analyze the asymmetric two-tasks case, where a secondary task is to help the learning of a primary task. Within this setting, we give bounds on the generalization error and the learning curve of the primary task. Our approach admits intuitive understandings of the multi-task GP by relating it to single-task GPs. For the case of one-dimensional input-space under optimal sampling with data only for the secondary task, the limitations of multi-task GP can be quantified explicitly.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kian Ming Adam Chai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chai:Kian_Ming_Adam"], "pages": 9}
