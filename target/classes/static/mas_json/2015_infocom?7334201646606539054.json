{"title": "VM-tracking: Visual-motion sensing integration for real-time human tracking.", "fields": ["tracking system", "eye tracking", "real time computing", "video tracking", "computer vision"], "abstract": "Human tracking in video has many practical applications such as visual guided navigation, assisted living, etc. In such applications, it is necessary to accurately track multiple humans across multiple cameras, subject to real-time constraints. Despite recent advances in visual tracking research, the tracking systems purely relying on visual information fail to meet the accuracy and real-time requirements at the same time. In this paper, we present a novel accurate and real-time human tracking system called VM-Tracking. The system aggregates the information of motion (M) sensor on human, and integrates it with visual (V) data based on physical locations. The system has two key features, i.e. location-based VM fusion and appearance-free tracking, which significantly distinguish itself from other existing human tracking systems. We have implemented the VM-Tracking system and conducted comprehensive experiments on challenging scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Qiang Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Qiang", "Sihao Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Sihao", "Xinfeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xinfeng", "Fan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Fan", "Jin Teng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teng:Jin", "Junda Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Junda", "Dong Xuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xuan:Dong", "Yuan F.
