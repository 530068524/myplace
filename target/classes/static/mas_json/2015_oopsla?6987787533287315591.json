In particular, all known lock-free reclamation schemes are ``manual'' in the sense that the developer has to specify when nodes have retired and may be reclaimed. Retiring nodes adequately is non-trivial and often requires the modification of the original lock-free algorithm. In this paper we present an automatic lock-free reclamation scheme for lock-free data-structures in the spirit of a mark-sweep garbage collection. The proposed algorithm works with any normalized lock-free algorithm and with no need for the programmer to retire nodes or make changes to the algorithm. Evaluation of the proposed scheme on a linked-list and a hash table shows that it performs similarly to the best manual (lock-free) memory reclamation scheme.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Nachshon Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Nachshon", "Erez Petrank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrank:Erez"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
