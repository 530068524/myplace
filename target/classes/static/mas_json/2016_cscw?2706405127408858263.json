This paper explores the various ways in which people create and use multiple user representations, specifically in online games. Using 8 years of population data from a popular multiplayer online game, EVE Online, we examine how multiple character creation and use occurs at scale and how operationalization of individuals between accounts and characters impacts methods. We suggest that conceptualizing participants in online games based on the assumption that one character equals one individual can lead to incorrect analyses regarding the demographics or behaviors of the population. Additionally, social network analysis suggests that a character-centric, rather than account-level, viewpoint can change the results of statistical relationships with network metrics such as eigenvector centrality.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Alex Leavitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leavitt:Alex", "Joshua A.
