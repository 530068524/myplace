As primary input for our methods we use the textual annotations provided by the users to predict the single most probable location where the image was taken. Central to our approach is a language model based entirely on the annotations provided by users. We define extensions to improve over the language model using tag-based smoothing and cell-based smoothing, and leveraging spatial ambiguity. Further we demonstrate how to incorporate GeoNames\\footnote{http://www.geonames.org visited May 2009}, a large external database of locations. For varying levels of granularity, we are able to place images on a map with at least twice the precision of the state-of-the-art reported in the literature.", "citation": "Citations (318)", "departments": ["University of Twente", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Pavel Serdyukov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serdyukov:Pavel", "Vanessa Murdock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murdock:Vanessa", "Roelof van Zwol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zwol:Roelof_van"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
