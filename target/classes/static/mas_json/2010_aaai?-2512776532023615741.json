We present ARTUE (Autonomous Response to Unexpected Events), a domain-independent autonomous agent that dynamically reasons about what goals to pursue in response to unexpected circumstances in these types of environments. ARTUE integrates AI research in planning, environment monitoring, explanation, goal generation, and goal management. To explain our conceptualization of the problem ARTUE addresses, we present a new conceptual framework, goal-driven autonomy, for agents that reason about their goals. We evaluate ARTUE on scenarios in the TAO Sandbox, a Navy training simulation, and demonstrate its novel architecture, which includes components for Hierarchical Task Network planning, explanation, and goal management. Our evaluation shows that ARTUE can perform well in a complex environment and that each component is necessary and contributes to the performance of the integrated system.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "departments": ["United States Naval Research Laboratory", "United States Naval Research Laboratory", "Knexus Research ... pringfield, VA"], "authors": ["Matthew Molineaux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Molineaux:Matthew", "Matthew Klenk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klenk:Matthew", "David W.
