{"title": "YouthTube: Youth Video Authorship on YouTube and Vine.", "fields": ["everyday life", "internet privacy", "content analysis", "vine", "performative utterance"], "abstract": "What kinds of content do children and teenagers author and share on public video platforms? We approached this question through a qualitative directed content analysis of over 250 youth-authored videos filtered by crowdworkers from public videos on YouTube and Vine. We found differences between YouTube and Vine platforms in terms of the age of the youth authors, the type of collaborations witnessed in the videos, and the significantly greater amount of violent, sexual, and obscene content on Vine. We also highlight possible differences in how adults and youths approach online video sharing. Specifically, we consider that adults may view online video as an archive to keep precious memories of everyday life with their family, friends, and pets, humorous moments, and special events, while children and teenagers treat online video as a stage to perform, tell stories, and express their opinions and identities in a performative way.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Minnesota", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Svetlana Yarosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yarosh:Svetlana", "Elizabeth M.
