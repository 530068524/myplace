Human tracking using multiple cameras is conducted employing a particle filter in conjunction with linear least-square trajectory extrapolation and color histogram matching. Spatial and temporal statistical information such as histograms of the number of pedestrians on a timeline-basis, pedestrians' trajectories over a certain period, pedestrian flow, and so forth is efficiently summarized and visualized. In addition, a sketch-based retrieval interface is also developed. As a result, our system facilitates operators to easily extract and access to important scenes from a huge amount of surveillance data. The real-life experiments in the public street demonstrated the validity of our system.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Toshihiko Yamasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamasaki:Toshihiko", "Yoshifumi Nishioka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishioka:Yoshifumi", "Kiyoharu Aizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aizawa:Kiyoharu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
