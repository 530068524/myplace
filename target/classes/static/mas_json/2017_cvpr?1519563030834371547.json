We instead propose a method that relies on human gaze as auxiliary information, exploiting that even non-expert users have a natural ability to judge class membership. We present a data collection paradigm that involves a discrimination task to increase the information content obtained from gaze data. Our method extracts discriminative descriptors from the data and learns a compatibility function between image and gaze using three novel gaze embeddings: Gaze Histograms (GH), Gaze Features with Grid (GFG) and Gaze Features with Sequence (GFS). We introduce two new gaze-annotated datasets for fine-grained image classification and show that human gaze data is indeed class discriminative, provides a competitive alternative to expert-annotated attributes, and outperforms other baselines for zero-shot image classification.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Nour Karessli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karessli:Nour", "Zeynep Akata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akata:Zeynep", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt", "Andreas Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Andreas"], "pages": 10}
