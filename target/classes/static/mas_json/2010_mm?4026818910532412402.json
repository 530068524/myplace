{"title": "A multimedia approach to visualize and interact with large scale mobile LiDAR data.", "fields": ["data set", "terabyte", "annotation", "mobile mapping", "lidar"], "abstract": "This paper presents a multimedia visualization tool for large-scale mobile LIDAR, panoramic imagery, high-resolution view targeted camera imagery, and GPS/IMU geo-location. A first of its kind system joins all sensor data providing a powerful tool for evaluation, validation, analysis and annotation. The viewer computes necessary real-time structures on the fly, which enables the user to view and annotate the entire dataset interactively. A viewpoint based multimedia integration of vehicle centerline map, video imagery, and LIDAR are displayed for navigation. The viewer automatically determines when to page data sets and which type of data to display. The user is able to measure and tag real world objects in 3D. A typical graphics card is capable of interactively presenting half terabyte data sets by intelligently controlling the timing and volume of data loading.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Navteq", "Navteq", "Navteq"], "authors": ["James D.
