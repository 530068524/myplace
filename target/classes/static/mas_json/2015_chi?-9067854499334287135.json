Given the attention to the home and the volume of research, what further areas of research might there be? Based on a critical analysis of 121 works on the topic, we present seven genres of domestic technology research in HCI: social routines in the home, ongoing domestic practices, the home as a testing ground, smart homes, contested values of a home, the home as a site for interpretation, and speculative visions of the home. We articulate dominant research perspectives in HCI, and we offer two complementary perspectives about how to investigate the domestic experience in future research: the material perspective and the first person perspective.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Audrey Desjardins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desjardins:Audrey", "Ron Wakkary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wakkary:Ron", "William Odom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Odom:William"], "pages": 10}
