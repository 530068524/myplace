Programming thousands of massively parallel threads is a big challenge for software engineers, but understanding the performance bottlenecks of those parallel programs on GPU architectures to improve application performance is even more difficult. Current approaches rely on programmers to tune their applications by exploiting the design space exhaustively without fully understanding the performance characteristics of their applications.   To provide insights into the performance bottlenecks of parallel applications on GPU architectures, we propose a simple analytical model that estimates the execution time of massively parallel programs. The key component of our model is estimating the number of parallel memory requests (we call this the memory warp parallelism) by considering the number of running threads and memory bandwidth. Based on the degree of memory warp parallelism, the model estimates the cost of memory requests, thereby estimating the overall execution time of a program. Comparisons between the outcome of the model and the actual execution time in several GPUs show that the geometric mean of absolute error of our model on micro-benchmarks is 5.4% and on GPU computing applications is 13.3%. All the applications are written in the CUDA programming language.", "citation": "Citations (626)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sunpyo Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Sunpyo", "Hyesoon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyesoon"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
