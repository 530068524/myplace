{"title": "Predicting Peer-to-Peer Loan Rates Using Bayesian Non-Linear Regression.", "fields": ["debt", "loan", "popularity", "nonlinear regression", "kriging"], "abstract": "Peer-to-peer lending is a new highly liquid market for debt, which is rapidly growing in popularity. Here we consider modelling market rates, developing a nonlinear Gaussian Process regression method which incorporates both structured data and unstructured text from the loan application. We show that the peer-to-peer market is predictable, and identify a small set of key factors with high predictive power. Our approach outperforms baseline methods for predicting market rates, and generates substantial profit in a trading simulation.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Zsolt Bitvai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bitvai:Zsolt", "Trevor Cohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohn:Trevor"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
