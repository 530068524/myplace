{"title": "pCubee: a perspective-corrected handheld cubic display.", "fields": ["rendering", "liquid crystal display", "dynamical simulation", "input device", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the design of a personal cubic display that offers novel interaction techniques for static and dynamic 3D content. We extended one-screen Fish Tank VR by arranging five small LCD panels into a box shape that is light and compact enough to be handheld. The display uses head-coupled perspective rendering and a real-time physics simulation engine to establish an interaction metaphor of having real objects inside a physical box that a user can hold and manipulate. We evaluated our prototype as a visualization tool and as an input device by comparing it with a conventional LCD display and mouse for a 3D tree-tracing task. We found that bimanual interaction with pCubee and a mouse offered the best performance and was most preferred by users. pCubee has potential in 3D visualization and interactive applications such as games, storytelling and education, as well as viewing 3D maps, medical and architectural data.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Ian Stavness.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stavness:Ian", "Billy Lam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lam:Billy", "Sidney S.
