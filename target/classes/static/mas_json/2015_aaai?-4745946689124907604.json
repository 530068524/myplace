{"title": "Congestion Games with Distance-Based Strict Uncertainty.", "fields": ["convergence", "mathematical economics", "congestion game", "welfare economics", "regret"], "abstract": "We put forward a new model of congestion games where agents have uncertainty over the routes used by other agents. We take a non-probabilistic approach, assuming that each agent knows that the number of agents using an edge is within a certain range. Given this uncertainty, we model agents who either minimize their worst-case cost (WCC) or their worstcase regret (WCR), and study implications on equilibrium existence, convergence through adaptive play, and efficiency. Under the WCC behavior the game reduces to a modified congestion game, and welfare improves when agents have moderate uncertainty. Under WCR behavior the game is not, in general, a congestion game, but we show convergence and efficiency bounds for a simple class of games.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Reshef Meir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meir:Reshef", "David C.
