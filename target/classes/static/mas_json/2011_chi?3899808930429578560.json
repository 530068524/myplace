Designing meaningful solutions for this complex work environment requires reflective thought and conceptual understanding of its social configuration. This paper presents organizing patterns of firefighting frontline practice as a means to inform ubiquitous computing design processes. The patterns originate from a qualitative analysis of an extensive range of user studies conducted with French and German firefighters. As the patterns show, firefighting on the frontline is based on a rigid structure that gains its flexibility through independent units whose safety is ensured by a number of monitoring activities. We conclude that the interaction between the presented patterns forms a balanced whole and needs to be recognized by ubiquitous computing design.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Fraunhofer Society"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sebastian Denef.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denef:Sebastian", "David V.
