{"title": "Sublinear Zero-Knowledge Arguments for RAM Programs.", "fields": ["random oracle", "commitment scheme", "zero knowledge proof", "oblivious ram", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "sublinear function"], "abstract": "We describe a new succinct zero-knowledge argument protocol with the following properties. The prover commits to a large data-set M, and can thereafter prove many statements of the form \\(\\exists w : \\mathcal {R}_i(M,w)=1\\), where \\(\\mathcal {R}_i\\) is a public function. The protocol is succinct in the sense that the cost for the verifier (in computation & communication) does not depend on |M|, not even in any initialization phase In each proof, the computation/communication cost for both the prover and the verifier is proportional only to the running time of an oblivious RAM program implementing \\(\\mathcal {R}_i\\) (in particular, this can be sublinear in |M|). The only costs that scale with |M| are the computational costs of the prover in a one-time initial commitment to M.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "North Carolina State University", "Visa Research"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Payman Mohassel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohassel:Payman", "Mike Rosulek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosulek:Mike", "Alessandra Scafuro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scafuro:Alessandra"], "pages": 31}
