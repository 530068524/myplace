{"title": "Towards adaptive programming: integrating reinforcement learning into a programming language.", "fields": ["comparison of multi paradigm programming languages", "very high level programming language", "programming domain", "third generation programming language", "programming language theory"], "abstract": "Current programming languages and software engineering paradigms are proving insufficient for building intelligent multi-agent systems--such as interactive games and narratives--where developers are called upon to write increasingly complex behavior for agents in dynamic environments. A promising solution is to build adaptive systems; that is, to develop software written specifically to adapt to its environment by changing its behavior in response to what it observes in the world. In this paper we describe a new programming language, An Adaptive Behavior Language (A2BL), that implements adaptive programming primitives to support partial programming, a paradigm in which a programmer need only specify the details of behavior known at code-writing time, leaving the run-time system to learn the rest. Partial programming enables programmers to more easily encode software agents that are difficult to write in existing languages that do not offer language-level support for adaptivity. We motivate the use of partial programming with an example agent coded in a cutting-edge, but non-adaptive agent programming language (ABL), and show how A2BL can encode the same agent much more naturally.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Christopher L.
