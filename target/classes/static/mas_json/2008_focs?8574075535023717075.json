First we introduce Fibonacci gates which provide a new class of polynomial time holographic algorithms. Then we develop holographic reductions. We show that holographic reductions followed by interpolations provide a uniform strategy to prove #P-hardness.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Tsinghua University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Jin-yi Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Jin=yi", "Pinyan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Pinyan", "Mingji Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Mingji"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
