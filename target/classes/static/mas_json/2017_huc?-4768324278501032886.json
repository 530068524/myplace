It has been used to remote control users for navigation and instrument playing, but also as a method to convey haptic feedback in VR, for example. As EMS devices become commercially available and application research continues, we explore EMS as a modality to convey information through actuation and as a means to induce and communicate emotions and moods. In this position paper, we present the results from two focus groups on using EMS for interpersonal communication as a way to send and receive emoticons through electrical stimulation. We argue that so-called \"EMS Icons\" have the potential to become part of multimedia experiences and more broadly of User Interfaces as a haptic variant in analogy to visual and auditory icons.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Osaka Prefecture University", "Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Tilman Dingler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dingler:Tilman", "Takashi Goto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goto:Takashi", "Benjamin Tag.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tag:Benjamin", "Kai Kunze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kunze:Kai"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
