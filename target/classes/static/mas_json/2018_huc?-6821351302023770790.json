An intimate mediation of technology lies in between our direct perceptions and the environment we perceive. Through three extreme ideal types of perceptual machines, this project defamiliarizes and questions the habitual ways in which we interpret, operate, and understand the visual world intervened by digital media. The three machines create: Hyper-sensitive vision - a speculation on social media's amplification effect and our filtered communication landscape. Hyper-focused vision - an analogue version of the searching behavior on the Internet. Hyper-commoditized vision - monetized vision that meditates on the omnipresent advertisement targeted all over our visual field. The site of intervention is the visual field in a technologically augmented society. All the three machines have both internal state and external signal. This duality allows them to be seen from outside and experienced from inside.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Jiabao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiabao", "Honghao Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Honghao", "Panagiotis Michalatos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michalatos:Panagiotis"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
