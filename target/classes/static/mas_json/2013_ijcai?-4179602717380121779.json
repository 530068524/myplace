{"title": "Bounded Epistemic Situation Calculus Theories.", "fields": ["fluent", "fluent calculus", "situation calculus", "infinite set", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We define the class of e-bounded theories in the epistemic situation calculus, where the number of fluent atoms that the agent thinks may be true is bounded by a constant. Such theories can still have an infinite domain and an infinite set of states. We show that for them verification of an expressive class of first-order \u00b5-calculus temporal epistemic properties is decidable. We also show that if the agent's knowledge in the initial situation is e-bounded and the objective part of an action theory maintains boundedness, then the entire epistemic theory is e-bounded.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["York University", "DIAG, Sapienza  ... a, Roma, Italy", "DIAG, Sapienza  ... a, Roma, Italy"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Giuseppe De Giacomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giacomo:Giuseppe_De", "Yves Lesp\u00e9rance.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lesp=eacute=rance:Yves", "Fabio Patrizi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patrizi:Fabio"], "pages": 8}
