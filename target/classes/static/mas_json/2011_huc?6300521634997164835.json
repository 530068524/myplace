This study proposes HeatProbe, a thermal-based power meter system that uses thermal imaging to track disaggregated appliance usage. We have designed, prototyped, and tested the HeatProbe system. Results show that HeatProbe successfully senses individual appliance operating durations with an average error of 125.03 seconds, achieving 80.2% appliance power accounting accuracy in different appliance usage scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "Academia Sinica", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Bo-Jhang Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Bo=Jhang", "Hsin-Liu Cindy Kao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kao:Hsin=Liu_Cindy", "Nan-Chen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Nan=Chen", "Chuang-Wen You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Chuang=Wen", "Hao-Hua Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Hao=Hua", "Ming-Syan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ming=Syan"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
