As the main challenge for object tracking is to account for drastic appearance change, we propose a robust appearance model that exploits both holistic templates and local representations. We develop a sparsity-based discriminative classifier (SD-C) and a sparsity-based generative model (SGM). In the S-DC module, we introduce an effective method to compute the confidence value that assigns more weights to the foreground than the background. In the SGM module, we propose a novel histogram-based method that takes the spatial information of each patch into consideration with an occlusion handing scheme. Furthermore, the update scheme considers both the latest observations and the original template, thereby enabling the tracker to deal with appearance change effectively and alleviate the drift problem. Numerous experiments on various challenging videos demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs favorably against several state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (915)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Dalian University of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "University of California, Merced"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wei Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Wei", "Huchuan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Huchuan", "Ming-Hsuan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Ming=Hsuan"], "pages": 8}
