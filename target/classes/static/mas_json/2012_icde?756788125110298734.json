{"title": "Efficient Dual-Resolution Layer Indexing for Top-k Queries.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "indexation", "data mining", "database", "tuple"], "abstract": "Top-k queries have gained considerable attention as an effective means for narrowing down the overwhelming amount of data. This paper studies the problem of constructing an indexing structure that efficiently supports top-k queries for varying scoring functions and retrieval sizes. The existing work can be categorized into three classes: list-, layer-, and view-based approaches. This paper focuses on the layer-based approach, pre-materializing tuples into consecutive multiple layers. The layer-based index enables us to return top-k answers efficiently by restricting access to tuples in the k layers. However, we observe that the number of tuples accessed in each layer can be reduced further. For this purpose, we propose a dual-resolution layer structure. Specifically, we iteratively build coarse-level layers using skylines, and divide each coarse-level layer into fine-level sub layers using convex skylines. The dual-resolution layer is able to leverage not only the dominance relationship between coarse-level layers, named for all-dominance, but also a relaxed dominance relationship between fine-level sub layers, named exists-dominance. Our extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces the number of tuples accessed than the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Jongwuk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jongwuk", "Hyunsouk Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Hyunsouk", "Seung-won Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Seung=won"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
