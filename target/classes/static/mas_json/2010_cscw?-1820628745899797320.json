{"title": "Reading between the lines: linguistic cues to deception in online dating profiles.", "fields": ["text mining", "communication", "deception", "affordance", "linguistics"], "abstract": "This study investigates whether deception in online dating profiles is detectable through a linguistic approach, which assumes that liars nonconsciously produce different word patterns than truth-tellers. We objectively measure deception in online dating profiles and analyze the linguistic composition of the open-ended component of the profile (i.e., \"about me\" section) using computerized text analysis. Results show that profile deceptions correlate with fewer self-references, increased negations, fewer negative emotion words and fewer overall words used in the textual self-description. Results are discussed in terms of (1) practical implications for detecting deception in online profiles; and (2) theoretical implications regarding the impact of media affordances (i.e., asynchronicity and editability) on the occurrence of linguistic cues to deception.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Catalina L.
