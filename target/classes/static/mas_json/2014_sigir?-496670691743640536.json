{"title": "Web page segmentation with structured prediction and its application in web page classification.", "fields": ["segmentation based object categorization", "web page", "integer programming", "structured prediction", "scale space segmentation"], "abstract": "We propose a framework which can perform Web page segmentation with a structured prediction approach. It formulates the segmentation task as a structured labeling problem on a transformed Web page segmentation graph (WPS-graph). WPS-graph models the candidate segmentation boundaries of a page and the dependency relation among the adjacent segmentation boundaries. Each labeling scheme on the WPS-graph corresponds to a possible segmentation of the page. The task of finding the optimal labeling of the WPS-graph is transformed into a binary Integer Linear Programming problem, which considers the entire WPS-graph as a whole to conduct structured prediction. A learning algorithm based on the structured output Support Vector Machine framework is developed to determine the feature weights, which is capable to consider the inter-dependency among candidate segmentation boundaries. Furthermore, we investigate its efficacy in supporting the development of automatic Web page classification.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Baidu", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Baidu", "Baidu"], "authors": ["Lidong Bing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bing:Lidong", "Rui Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Rui", "Wai Lam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lam:Wai", "Zheng-Yu Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Zheng=Yu", "Haifeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haifeng"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
