A tremendous number of X-ray imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are accumulated and stored in many modern hospitals Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). On the other side, it is still an open question how this type of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable imaging informatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to facilitate the data-hungry deep learning paradigms in building truly large-scale high precision computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. In this paper, we present a new chest X-ray database, namely ChestX-ray8, which comprises 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients with the text-mined eight disease image labels (where each image can have multi-labels), from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing. Importantly, we demonstrate that these commonly occurring thoracic diseases can be detected and even spatially-located via a unified weakly-supervised multi-label image classification and disease localization framework, which is validated using our proposed dataset. Although the initial quantitative results are promising as reported, deep convolutional neural network based reading chest X-rays (i.e., recognizing and locating the common disease patterns trained with only image-level labels) remains a strenuous task for fully-automated high precision CAD systems.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["National Institutes of Health", "National Institutes of Health", "National Institutes of Health", "National Institutes of Health", "National Institutes of Health"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xiaosong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaosong", "Yifan Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Yifan", "Le Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Le", "Zhiyong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhiyong", "Mohammadhadi Bagheri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagheri:Mohammadhadi", "Ronald M.
