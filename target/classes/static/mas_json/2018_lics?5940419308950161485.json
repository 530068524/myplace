{"title": "Can One Escape Red Chains?: Regular Path Queries Determinacy is Undecidable.", "fields": ["database theory", "undecidable problem", "expression", "determinacy", "graph database"], "abstract": "For a given set of queries (which are expressions in some query language) Q = {Q1, Q2, ... Qk} and for another query Q0 we say that Q determines Q0 if -- informally speaking -- for every database D, the information contained in the views Q(D) is sufficient to compute Q0(D).   Query Determinacy Problem is the problem of deciding, for given Q and Q0. whether Q determines Q0. Many versions of this problem, for different query languages, were studied in database theory. In this paper we solve a problem stated in [CGLV02] and show that Query Determinacy Problem is undecidable for the Regular Path Queries -- the paradigmatic query language of graph databases.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw"], "authors": ["Grzegorz Gluch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gluch:Grzegorz", "Jerzy Marcinkowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marcinkowski:Jerzy", "Piotr Ostropolski-Nalewaja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostropolski=Nalewaja:Piotr"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
