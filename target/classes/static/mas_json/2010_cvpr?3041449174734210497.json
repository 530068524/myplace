Given a complex line drawing representing a solid object, our algorithm finds the places, called cuts, to separate the line drawing into much simpler ones. The complex 3D object is obtained by first reconstructing the 3D objects from these simpler line drawings and then combining them together. Several propositions and criteria are presented for cut finding. A theorem is given to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the separation of a line drawing along a cut. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can deal with more complex 3D object reconstruction than state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tianfan Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Tianfan", "Jianzhuang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jianzhuang", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "pages": 8}
