{"title": "Automatic Topic Discovery for Multi-Object Tracking.", "fields": ["data set", "heuristic", "dirichlet process", "topic model", "video tracking"], "abstract": "This paper proposes a new approach to multi-object tracking by semantic topic discovery. We dynamically cluster frame-by-frame detections and treat objects as topics, allowing the application of the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). The tracking problem is cast as a topic-discovery task where the video sequence is treated analogously to a document. This formulation addresses tracking issues such as object exclusivity constraints as well as cannot-link constraints which are integrated without the need for heuristic thresholds. The video is temporally segmented into epochs to model the dynamics of word (superpixel) co-occurrences and to model the temporal damping effect. In experiments on public data sets we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Toshiba", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Wenhan Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Wenhan", "Bj\u00f6rn Stenger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stenger:Bj=ouml=rn", "Xiaowei Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xiaowei", "Tae-Kyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Tae=Kyun"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
