They particularly enhance the quality of human-machine interactions by providing realistic haptic perception of textures. In this paper, inspired by the similarities observed between vibrotactile texture signals and speech signals, we present a novel vibrotactile texture codec for bilateral teleoperation, based on well-known speech coding techniques. The proposed low bitrate, high quality codec preserves not only the spectral signature vital to the general feel of the texture, but also important temporal features of the texture signal. We report a compression ratio of 8:1 (12.5 %) with a  constant  output bitrate of 4 kbps, and we validate the perceptual transparency of the codec via rigorous subjective tests and analyses.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Pennsylvania", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Rahul Gopal Chaudhari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhari:Rahul_Gopal", "Burak Cizmeci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cizmeci:Burak", "Katherine J.
