We reflect upon two studies, employing different design methodologies, relating to the design of rehabilitative exergames in Parkinson's. The first explored the concept of designing 'for' People with Parkinson's (PwP) and focused on specifications outlined by clinical stakeholders. The second used a designing 'with' approach and modified a pre-established participatory design method for use with PwP. We call attention to the importance of carrying out design work with PwP and contribute; an empathic understanding of living with Parkinson's, a set of recommendations for how to design with PwP and a set of wider considerations for developing rehabilitative exergames for PwP.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Roisin McNaney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McNaney:Roisin", "Madeline Balaam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balaam:Madeline", "Amey Holden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holden:Amey", "Guy Schofield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schofield:Guy", "Daniel Jackson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jackson_0002:Daniel", "Mary Webster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Webster:Mary", "Brook Galna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galna:Brook", "Gillian Barry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barry:Gillian", "Lynn Rochester.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rochester:Lynn", "Patrick Olivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivier:Patrick"], "pages": 10}
