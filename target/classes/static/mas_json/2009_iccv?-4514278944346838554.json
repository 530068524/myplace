The key observation we make is that a BRDF may be viewed as a statistical distribution on a unit hemisphere. We derive a novel directional statistics distribution, which we refer to as the hemispherical exponential power distribution, and model real-world isotropic BRDFs as mixtures of it. We derive a canonical probabilistic method for estimating the parameters, including the number of components, of this novel directional statistics BRDF model. We show that the model captures the full spectrum of real-world isotropic BRDFs with high accuracy, but a small footprint. We also demonstrate the advantages of the novel BRDF model by showing its use for reflection component separation and for exploring the space of isotropic BRDFs.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ko Nishino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishino:Ko"], "pages": 8}
