To aid the controlling of finger movement, we present PossessedHand, a device with a forearm belt that can inform when and which fingers should be moved. PossessedHand controls the user's fingers by applying electrical stimulus to the muscles around the forearm. Each muscle is stimulated via 28 electrode pads. Muscles at different depths in the forearm can be selected for simulation by varying the stimulation level. PossessedHand can automatically calibrate the system for individuals. The automatic calibration system estimates relations between each electrode pad, stimulation level and muscle movement. Experiments show that PossessedHand can control the motion of 16 joints in the hand. Further, we also discuss an application based on this device to aid in playing a musical instrument.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Emi Tamaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamaki:Emi", "Takashi Miyaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miyaki:Takashi", "Jun Rekimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rekimoto:Jun"], "pages": 10}
