Most of the existing DL methods aim to learn a synthesis dictionary to represent the input signal while enforcing the representation coefficients and/or representation residual to be discriminative. However, the l0 or l1-norm sparsity constraint on the representation coefficients adopted in most DL methods makes the training and testing phases time consuming. We propose anew discriminative DL framework, namely projective dictionary pair learning (DPL), which learns a synthesis dictionary and an analysis dictionary jointly to achieve the goal of signal representation and discrimination. Compared with conventional DL methods, the proposed DPL method can not only greatly reduce the time complexity in the training and testing phases, but also lead to very competitive accuracies in a variety of visual classification tasks.", "citation": "Citations (156)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Xidian University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shuhang Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Shuhang", "Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Lei", "Wangmeng Zuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuo:Wangmeng", "Xiangchu Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Xiangchu"], "pages": 9}
