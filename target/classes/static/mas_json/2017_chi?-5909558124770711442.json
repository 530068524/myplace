It reports the use of this support as part of the plant's risk management process over 66 working days. Results revealed that this use led to more complete, more useful and more novel risk resolutions, compared with the original paper process, and informed how digital creativity support can be rolled out across manufacturing plants, as well as to other domains not recognized as creative.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["City University London", "City University London", "City University London", "FCA Group, Torino, Italy", "CNH Industrial, ...
