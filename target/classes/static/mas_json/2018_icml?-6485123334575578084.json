We provide two approximation algorithms for maximizing a non-submodular function on the integer lattice subject to a cardinality constraint; these are the first algorithms for this purpose that have polynomial query complexity. We propose a general framework for influence maximization on the integer lattice that generalizes prior works on this topic, and we demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms in this context.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Alan Kuhnle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhnle:Alan", "J.
