In particular, we learn separate deep representations for semantic-components and color-texture distributions from two person images and then employ pyramid person matching network (PPMN) to obtain correspondence representations. These correspondence representations are fused to perform the re-identification task. Further, the proposed framework is optimized via a unified end-to-end deep learning scheme. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against the state-of-the-art literature, especially on the rank-1 recognition rate.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Chaojie Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Chaojie", "Yingming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yingming", "Yaqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yaqing", "Zhongfei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhongfei", "Xi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
