In this paper we present a system, called FaceNet, that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face similarity. Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings as feature vectors.", "citation": "Citations (1,936)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Florian Schroff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schroff:Florian", "Dmitry Kalenichenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalenichenko:Dmitry", "James Philbin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Philbin:James"], "pages": 9}
