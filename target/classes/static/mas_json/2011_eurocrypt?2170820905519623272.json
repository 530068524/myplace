Our approach can enjoy lower communication and computation overhead than methods based on cut-and-choose [13] and lower overhead than methods based on zero-knowledge proofs [8] (or \u03a3-protocols [14]). To do so, we develop and analyze new solutions to issues arising with this transformation: -- How to guarantee the generator's input consistency -- How to support different outputs for each player without adding extra gates to the circuit of the function f being computed -- How the evaluator can retrieve input keys but avoid selective failure attacks -- Challenging 3/5 of the circuits is near optimal for cut-and-choose (and better than challenging 1/2).\n\nOur protocols require the existence of secure-OT and claw-free functions that have a weak malleability property. We discuss an experimental implementation of our protocol to validate our efficiency claims.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Abhi Shelat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shelat:Abhi", "Chih-Hao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chih=Hao"], "pages": 20}
