The number of constraints is cn where c is a constant. We prove that for every possible distribution, either the resolution complexity is almost surely polylogarithmic for sufficiently large c, or it is almost surely exponential for every c > 0. We characterize the distributions of each type. To do so, we introduce a closure operation on a set of constraints which yields the set of all constraints that, in some sense, appear implicitly in the random CSP.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Siu On Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Siu_On", "Michael Molloy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Molloy:Michael"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
