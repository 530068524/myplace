The storyline of a video describes causal relationships between actions. Beyond recognition of individual actions, discovering causal relationships helps to better understand the semantic meaning of the activities. We present an approach to learn a visually grounded storyline model of videos directly from weakly labeled data. The storyline model is represented as an AND-OR graph, a structure that can compactly encode storyline variation across videos. The edges in the AND-OR graph correspond to causal relationships which are represented in terms of spatio-temporal constraints. We formulate an Integer Programming framework for action recognition and storyline extraction using the storyline model and visual groundings learned from training data.", "citation": "Citations (287)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Abhinav Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Abhinav", "Praveen Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Praveen", "Jianbo Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jianbo", "Larry S.
