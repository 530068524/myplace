{"title": "Finding support sentences for entities.", "fields": ["sentence", "weak entity", "bag of words model", "named entity", "entity linking"], "abstract": "We study the problem of finding sentences that explain the relationship between a named entity and an ad-hoc query, which we refer to as  entity support sentences . This is an important sub-problem of entity ranking which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed before. In this paper we give the first formalization of the problem, how it can be evaluated, and present a full evaluation dataset. We propose several methods to rank these sentences, namely retrieval-based, entity-ranking based and position-based. We found that traditional bag-of-words models perform relatively well when there is a match between an entity and a query in a given sentence, but they fail to find a support sentence for a substantial portion of entities. This can be improved by incorporating small windows of context sentences and ranking them appropriately.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Roi Blanco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanco:Roi", "Hugo Zaragoza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaragoza:Hugo"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
