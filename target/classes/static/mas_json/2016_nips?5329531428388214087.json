As users interact with different items over time, users' and items' feature may evolve and co-evolve over time. Traditional models based on static latent features or discretizing time into epochs can become ineffective for capturing the fine-grained temporal dynamics in the user-item interactions. We propose a coevolutionary latent feature process model that accurately captures the coevolving nature of users' and items' feature. To learn parameters, we design an efficient convex optimization algorithm with a novel low rank space sharing constraints. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in user behavior prediction compared to state-of-the-arts.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yichen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yichen", "Nan Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Nan", "Rakshit Trivedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trivedi:Rakshit", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
