Traditional recommendation techniques such as Nearest Neighbors (NN) and Matrix Factorization (MF) have been widely used in real recommender systems. However, neither approaches can well accomplish recommendation task since that: (1) most NN methods leverage the neighbor's behaviors for prediction, which may suffer the severe data sparsity problem; (2) MF methods are less sensitive to sparsity, but neighbors' influences on latent factors are not fully explored, since the latent factors are often used independently. To overcome the above problems, we propose a new framework for recommender systems, called collaborative factorization. It expresses the user as the combination of his own factors and those of the neighbors', called collaborative latent factors, and a ranking loss is then utilized for optimization. The advantage of our approach is that it can both enjoy the merits of NN and MF methods. In this paper, we take the logistic loss in RankNet and the likelihood loss in ListMLE as examples, and the corresponding collaborative factorization methods are called CoF-Net and CoF-MLE. Our experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that they are more effective than several state-of-the-art recommendation methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Peking University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Chaosheng Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Chaosheng", "Yanyan Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Yanyan", "Jiafeng Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Jiafeng", "Zuoquan Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zuoquan", "Xueqi Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xueqi"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
