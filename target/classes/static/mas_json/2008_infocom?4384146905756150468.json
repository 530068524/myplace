{"title": "A New Perspective on Internet Security using Insurance.", "fields": ["business interruption insurance", "self insurance", "risk pool", "cyber insurance", "group insurance"], "abstract": "Managing security risks in the Internet has so far mostly involved methods to reduce the risks and the severity of the damages. Those methods (such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention, etc) reduce but do not eliminate risk, and the question remains on how to handle the residual risk. In this paper, we take a new approach to the problem of Internet security and advocate managing this residual risk by buying insurance against it. Using insurance in the Internet raises several questions because entities in the Internet face correlated risks, which means that insurance claims will likely be correlated, making those entities less attractive to insurance companies. Furthermore, risks are interdependent, meaning that the decision by an entity to invest in security and self-protect affects the risk faced by others. We analyze the impact of these externalities on the security investments of users using a simple 2-agent model. Our key results are that there are sound economic reasons for agents to not invest much in self-protection, and that insurance is a desirable incentive mechanism which pushes agents over a threshold into a desirable state where they all invest in self-protection. In other words, insurance increases the level of self-protection, and therefore the level of security, in the Internet. Therefore, we believe that insurance should become an important component of risk management in the Internet.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["Sprint Corporation", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Jean-Chrysostome Bolot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bolot:Jean=Chrysostome", "Marc Lelarge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lelarge:Marc"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
