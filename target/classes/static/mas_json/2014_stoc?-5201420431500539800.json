{"title": "Cluster before you hallucinate: approximating node-capacitated network design and energy efficient routing.", "fields": ["unicast", "induced subgraph", "multicast", "static routing", "idle"], "abstract": "We consider circuit routing with an objective of minimizing energy, in a network of routers that are speed scalable and that may be shutdown when idle. It is known that this energy minimization problem can be reduced to a capacitated flow network design problem, where vertices have a common capacity but arbitrary costs, and the goal is to choose a minimum cost collection of vertices whose induced subgraph will support the specified flow requirements. For the multicast (single-sink) capacitated design problem we give a polynomial-time algorithm that is  O (log 3   n )- approximate with  O (log 4   n ) congestion. This translates back to a  O (log 4\u03b1+3   n )-approximation for the multicast energy-minimization routing problem, where \u03b1 is the polynomial exponent in the dynamic power used by a router. For the unicast (multicommodity) capacitated design problem we give a polynomial-time algorithm that is  O (log 5   n )-approximate with  O (log 12   n ) congestion, which translates back to a  O (log 12\u03b1+5   n )-approximation for the unicast energy-minimization routing problem.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Princeton University", "IBM", "University of Pittsburgh", "Columbia University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ravishankar Krishnaswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnaswamy:Ravishankar", "Viswanath Nagarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagarajan:Viswanath", "Kirk Pruhs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pruhs:Kirk", "Cliff Stein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stein:Cliff"], "pages": 10}
