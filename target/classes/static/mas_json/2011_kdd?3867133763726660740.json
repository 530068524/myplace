In many real-world applications, a large number of unlabeled samples arrive in a streaming manner, making it impossible to maintain all the data in a candidate pool. In this work, we focus on binary classification problems and study selective labeling in data streams where a decision is required on each sample sequentially. We consider the unbiasedness property in the sampling process, and design optimal instrumental distributions to minimize the variance in the stochastic process. Meanwhile, Bayesian linear classifiers with weighted maximum likelihood are optimized online to estimate parameters. In empirical evaluation, we collect a data stream of user-generated comments on a commercial news portal in 30 consecutive days, and carry out offline evaluation to compare various sampling strategies, including unbiased active learning, biased variants, and random sampling. Experimental results verify the usefulness of online active learning, especially in the non-stationary situation with concept drift.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Wei Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Wei", "Martin Zinkevich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zinkevich:Martin", "Lihong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Lihong", "Achint Thomas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomas:Achint", "Belle L.
