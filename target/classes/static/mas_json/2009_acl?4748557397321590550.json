We explore how to generate a series of summaries with various lengths based on them. To obtain more reliable associations between sentences, we introduce wiki concepts according to the internal links in Wikipedia. In addition, we develop an extended document concept lattice model to combine wiki concepts and non-textual features such as the outline and infobox. The model can concatenate representative sentences from non-overlapping salient local topics for summary generation. We test our model based on our annotated wiki articles which topics come from TREC-QA 2004--2006 evaluations. The results show that the model is effective in summarization and definition QA.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Shiren Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Shiren", "Tat-Seng Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Tat=Seng", "Jie Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Jie"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
