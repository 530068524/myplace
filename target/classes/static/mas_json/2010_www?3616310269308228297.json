MIntOS monitors users' interactions both for gathering interaction history and for the runtime construction of interaction context. A simple approach based on interaction burstiness is used to break interaction sequences into Trails, which approximates user tasks. Such Trails are used to generate rules for online, context-sensitive prediction of future interaction sequences. Predicted user interaction sequences are then optimized to reduce the amount of user input and user wait time using techniques such as interaction short-cuts, automatic text copying and form-filling, as well as page pre-fetching. Such optimized interaction sequences are, at real-time, recommended to the user through UI enhancements in a non-intrusive manner.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo", "NTT DoCoMo"], "authors": ["Dong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Dong", "Ajay Chander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chander:Ajay", "Hiroshi Inamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inamura:Hiroshi"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
