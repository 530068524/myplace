In these applications, it is critical to operate a sensor network in an energy-efficient manner so the barrier can be covered with as few active sensors as possible. In this paper, we study barrier information coverage which exploits collaborations and information fusion between neighboring sensors to reduce the number of active sensors needed to cover a barrier and hence to prolong the network lifetime. Moreover, we propose a practical solution to identify the barrier information coverage set which can information-cover the barrier with a small number of active sensors. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated by numerical and simulation results.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Guanqun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Guanqun", "Daji Qiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiao:Daji"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
