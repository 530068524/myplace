By considering a novel problem formulation\u2014the minimization of a sum of piecewise functions\u2014we describe a principled and general mechanism for exploiting piecewise linear structure in convex optimization. This result leads to a theoretically justified working set algorithm and a novel screening test, which generalize and improve upon many prior results on exploiting structure in convex optimization. In empirical comparisons, we study the scalability of our methods. We find that screening scales surprisingly poorly with the size of the problem, while our working set algorithm convincingly outperforms alternative approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Washington"], "authors": ["Tyler B.
