For a linear system of dimension n, our technique needs \\(n+1\\) simulation runs. This is in contrast to current simulation based approaches, where the number of simulations either depends upon the number of vertices in the convex polyhedral initial set, or on the proximity of the unsafe set to the set of reachable states. At its core, our algorithm exploits the superposition principle of linear systems. Our algorithm computes both an over and an under approximation of the set of reachable states.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Connecticut", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Parasara Sridhar Duggirala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duggirala:Parasara_Sridhar", "Mahesh Viswanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viswanathan_0001:Mahesh"], "pages": 18}
