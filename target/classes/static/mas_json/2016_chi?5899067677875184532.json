{"title": "Effects of Pedagogical Agent's Personality and Emotional Feedback Strategy on Chinese Students' Learning Experiences and Performance: A Study Based on Virtual Tai Chi Training Studio.", "fields": ["studio", "virtual learning environment", "personality type", "gesture", "training system"], "abstract": "In virtual learning environment, both personality and emotional features of animated pedagogical agents (APAs) may influence learning. To investigate this question, we developed four APAs with two distinct personality types and two sets of gestures expressing distinct emotional feedback. Effects of APAs' personality types and emotional feedback strategies on learning experiences and performance were assessed experimentally using a virtual Tai Chi training system. Fifty six participants completed the experiment. Results showed that positive emotional feedback strategy led to better learning experiences and performance than negative feedback strategy. Moreover, personality type had significant effect on learning. Choleric APAs led to better performance than Phlegmatic APAs. Personality types moderated the effect of emotional feedback on learning satisfaction. Our study demonstrates that APAs with distinct personality types and emotional feedback are important design parameters for virtual learning environments.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Shandong Normal University", "Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Shandong Normal University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yulong Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Yulong", "Chenglei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Chenglei", "Dong-Dong Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Dong=Dong", "Sa Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Sa", "Fengqiang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Fengqiang", "Chia Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chia", "Xiangxu Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Xiangxu"], "pages": 12}
