{"title": "SemDiff: Analysis and recommendation support for API evolution.", "fields": ["systems engineering", "change detection", "java", "application programming interface", "software"], "abstract": "As a framework evolves, changes in its Application Programming Interface (API) can break client programs that extend the framework. Repairing a client program can be a challenging task because developers need to understand the context surrounding the API change. This paper describes SemDiff, a tool that recommends replacements for framework methods that were accessed by a client program and deleted during the evolution of the framework. SemDiff recommends replacements for non-trivial changes undiscovered by other change-detection techniques and also enables developers to look at the context of the changes that led to the deletion of a framework method.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Dagenais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dagenais:Barth=eacute=l=eacute=my", "Martin P.
