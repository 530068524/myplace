For such a network to be viable, its design must protect data privacy and authenticity given that medical data are highly sensitive. We identify the unique security challenges facing such a sensor network and propose a set of resource-efficient mechanisms to address these challenges. Our solution includes (1) a novel two-tier scheme for verifying the authenticity of patient data; (2) an ECC-based secure key exchange protocol to set up shared keys between sensor nodes and base stations; and (3) symmetric encryption/decryption for protecting data confidentiality and integrity. We have implemented the proposed mechanisms on a wireless mote platform and our results confirm their feasibility.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Memphis", "University of Memphis"], "authors": ["Kriangsiri Malasri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malasri:Kriangsiri", "Lan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lan"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
