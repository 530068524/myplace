{"title": "Leveraging Well-Conditioned Bases: Streaming and Distributed Summaries in Minkowski p-Norms.", "fields": ["linear algebra", "matrix multiplication", "low rank approximation", "streaming algorithm", "minkowski space"], "abstract": "Work on approximate linear algebra has led to efficient distributed and streaming algorithms for problems such as approximate matrix multiplication, low rank approximation, and regression, primarily for the Euclidean norm $\\ell_2$. We study other $\\ell_p$ norms, which are more robust for $p   2$. Unlike previous algorithms for such norms, we give algorithms that are (1) deterministic, (2) work simultaneously for every $p \\geq 1$, including $p = \\infty$, and (3) can be implemented in both distributed and streaming environments. We apply our results to $\\ell_p$-regression, entrywise $\\ell_1$-low rank approximation, and approximate matrix multiplication.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "The Turing Institute", "University of Warwick", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Graham Cormode.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cormode:Graham", "Charlie Dickens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dickens:Charlie", "David P.
