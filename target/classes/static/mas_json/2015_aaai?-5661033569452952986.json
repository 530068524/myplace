However, since MF models are generally non-convex, most of the existing methods are easily stuck into bad local minima, especially in the presence of outliers and missing data. To alleviate this deficiency, in this study we present a new MF learning methodology by gradually including matrix elements into MF training from easy to complex. This corresponds to a recently proposed learning fashion called self-paced learning (SPL), which has been demonstrated to be beneficial in avoiding bad local minima. We also generalize the conventional binary (hard) weighting scheme for SPL to a more effective real-valued (soft) weighting manner. The effectiveness of the proposed self-paced MF method is substantiated by a series of experiments on synthetic, structure from motion and background subtraction data.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Qian Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0002:Qian", "Deyu Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Deyu", "Lu Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0004:Lu", "Qi Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Qi", "Zongben Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zongben", "Alexander G.
