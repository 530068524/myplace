{"title": "Tamp: A Library for Compact Deep Neural Networks with Structured Matrices.", "fields": ["deep learning", "matrix", "cuda", "artificial neural network", "data type"], "abstract": "We introduce Tamp, an open source C++ library for reducing the space and time costs of deep neural network models. In particular, Tamp implements several recent works which use structured matrices to replace unstructured matrices which are often bottlenecks in neural networks.   Tamp is also designed to serve as a unified development platform with several supported optimization back-ends and abstracted data types.   This paper introduces the design and API and also demonstrates the effectiveness with experiments on public datasets.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Bingchen Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Bingchen", "Brendan Jou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jou:Brendan", "Felix X.
