{"title": "People-Nearby Applications: How Newcomers Move Their Relationships Offline and Develop Social and Cultural Capital.", "fields": ["theory of forms", "knowledge management", "social capital", "feeling", "cultural capital"], "abstract": "People-nearby applications (PNAs), such as Tinder and Badoo, help millions of users to make new social connections everyday. However, little is known about how PNAs support offline interactions or what application features are associated with offline encounters. Research suggests that these applications support the development of social capital, but the forms of social capital are unclear. We conducted interviews with 14 active PNA users to address these questions. Our results suggest that while existing PNA features such as filters, profile photos, and chat support online connections, most participants used non-PNA platforms to build mutual trust before meeting offline. In addition, PNA users developed two forms of social (informal and formal) and cultural capital (incorporated and symbolic). We offer insights into how PNAs and non-PNAs intersect to foster feelings of safety and trust prior to offline meetings, and we propose ways for PNAs to support the exchange of cultural and social capital.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Joey Chiao-Yin Hsiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsiao:Joey_Chiao=Yin", "Tawanna R.
