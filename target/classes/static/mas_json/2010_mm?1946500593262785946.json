This paper formulates the selection of groups of discriminative features by the extension of group lasso with logistic regression for high-dimensional feature setting, we call it as the heterogeneous feature selection by Group Lasso with Logistic Regression (GLLR). GLLR encodes a sparse grouping prior to seek after a more interpretable model for feature selection and can identify most of discriminative groups of homogeneous features. The utilization of GLLR for image annotation shows the proposed GLLR achieves a better performance.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Ying Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Ying", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
