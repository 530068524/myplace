{"title": "Evaluating longitudinal projects combining technology with temporal arts.", "fields": ["dance", "performing arts", "choreography", "creativity", "the arts"], "abstract": "The integration of interactive technology with temporal art such as dance is an exciting, emerging area. The design space for such collaborations is immense, with variations in sensors, visualizations, and how these interact with dancers and choreography. This paper presents the evaluation methodology and results of Dance.Draw, a longitudinal project spanning two years and three productions, which aimed to develop a deep, interdisciplinary understanding of this space. Given that this is pioneering work, there is little guidance on how to evaluate such collaborations. We describe the significant confounds in doing evaluation in this area, and we present our evolving mixed-methods approach, which includes two unique methods to address the multiple stakeholders in a holistic manner: dancer focus groups and repeated presentations. Our approach has generated insights, such as differing perspectives of audience members and the responses of dancers to technological variables. We conclude by discussing the challenges and successes of our evaluation approach.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Celine Latulipe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Latulipe:Celine", "Erin A.
