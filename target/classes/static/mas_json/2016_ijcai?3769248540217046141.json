{"title": "Heuristic Planning for PDDL+ Domains.", "fields": ["heuristic", "planner", "model checking", "planning domain definition language", "domain model"], "abstract": "Planning with hybrid domains modelled in PDDL+ has been gaining research interest in the Automated Planning community in recent years. Hybrid domain models capture a more accurate representation of real world problems that involve continuous processes than is possible using discrete systems. However, solving problems represented as PDDL+ domains is very challenging due to the construction of complex system dynamics, including non-linear processes and events. In this paper we introduce DiNo, a new planner capable of tackling complex problems with non-linear system dynamics governing the continuous evolution of states. DiNo is based on the discretise-and-validate approach and uses the novel Staged Relaxed Planning Graph+ (SRPG+) heuristic, which is introduced in this paper. Although several planners have been developed to work with subsets of PDDL+ features, or restricted forms of processes, DiNo is currently the only heuristic planner capable of handling non-linear system dynamics combined with the full PDDL+ feature set.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["King's College London", "King's College London", "King's College London", "King's College London", "University of Milan"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Wiktor Mateusz Piotrowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piotrowski:Wiktor_Mateusz", "Maria Fox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fox:Maria", "Derek Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Derek", "Daniele Magazzeni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magazzeni:Daniele", "Fabio Mercorio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mercorio:Fabio"], "pages": 7}
