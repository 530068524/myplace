In this paper, we propose a novel and practical mobile-cloud platform for smart mobile devices. Our platform allows users to run the entire mobile device operating system and arbitrary applications on a cloud-based virtual machine. It has two design fundamentals. First, applications can freely migrate between the user's mobile device and a backend cloud server. We design a file system extension to enable this feature, so users can freely choose to run their applications either in the cloud (for high security guarantees), or on their local mobile device (for better user experience). Second, in order to protect user data on the smart mobile device, we leverage hardware virtualization technology, which isolates the data from the local mobile device operating system. We have implemented a prototype of our platform using off-the-shelf hardware, and performed an extensive evaluation of it. We show that our platform is efficient, practical, and secure.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "Binghamton University", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Zijiang Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Zijiang", "Yutao Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Yutao", "Yifan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Yifan", "Edmund Novak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novak:Edmund", "Nancy Carter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carter:Nancy", "Qun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Qun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
