This is representative example within a broad family of problems in which multiple sensing devices are deployed, each in general observing multiple targets. A camera's configuration here consists of its orientation and its zoom factor or field of view (its position is given); the quality of a target's reading by a camera depends (inversely) on both the distance and field of view. After briefly discussing an easy setting in which a target accumulates measurement quality from all cameras observing it, we move on to a more challenging setting in which for each target only the best measurement of it is counted. Although both variants admit continuous solutions, we observe that we may restrict our attention to solutions based on pinned cones.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "City University of New York"], "authors": ["Matthew P.
