{"title": "Provenance browser: Displaying and querying scientific workflow provenance graphs.", "fields": ["query language", "rdf", "data dependency", "data visualization", "workflow"], "abstract": "This demonstration presents an interactive provenance browser for visualizing and querying data dependency (lineage) graphs produced by scientific workflow runs. The browser allows users to explore different views of provenance as well as to express complex and recursive graph queries through a high-level query language (QLP). Answers to QLP queries are lineage preserving in that queries return sets of lineage dependencies (denoting provenance graphs), which can be further queried and visually displayed (as graphs) in the browser. By combining provenance visualization, navigation, and query, the provenance browser can enable scientists to more easily access and explore scientific workflow provenance information.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "Gonzaga University", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Manish Kumar Anand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anand:Manish_Kumar", "Shawn Bowers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bowers:Shawn", "Bertram Lud\u00e4scher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lud=auml=scher:Bertram"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
