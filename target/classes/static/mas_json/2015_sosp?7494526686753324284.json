{"title": "Interruptible tasks: treating memory pressure as interrupts for highly scalable data-parallel programs.", "fields": ["runtime system", "real time computing", "scalability", "programming paradigm", "parallel computing"], "abstract": "Real-world data-parallel programs commonly suffer from great  memory pressure , especially when they are executed to process large datasets. Memory problems lead to excessive GC effort and out-of-memory errors, significantly hurting system performance and scalability. This paper proposes a systematic approach that can help data-parallel tasks  survive  memory pressure, improving their performance and scalability without needing any manual effort to tune system parameters. Our approach advocates  interruptible task  (ITask), a new type of data-parallel tasks that can be interrupted upon memory pressure---with part or all of their used memory reclaimed---and resumed when the pressure goes away.   To support ITasks, we propose a novel programming model and a runtime system, and have instantiated them on two state-of-the-art platforms  Hadoop  and  Hyracks.  A thorough evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of ITask: it has helped real-world Hadoop programs survive 13 out-of-memory problems reported on StackOverflow; a second set of experiments with 5 already well-tuned programs in Hyracks on datasets of different sizes shows that the ITask-based versions are 1.5--3x faster and scale to 3--24x larger datasets than their regular counterparts.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of Chicago"], "authors": ["Lu Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Lu", "Khanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Khanh", "Guoqing (Harry) Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Guoqing_=Harry=", "Brian Demsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demsky:Brian", "Shan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Shan"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2015", "pages": 16}
