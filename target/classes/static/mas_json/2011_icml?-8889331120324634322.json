{"title": "Functional Regularized Least Squares Classication with Operator-valued Kernels.", "fields": ["regularized least squares", "sound recognition", "functional data analysis", "operator", "functional regression"], "abstract": "Although operator-valued kernels have recently received increasing interest in various machine learning and functional data analysis problems such as multi-task learning or functional regression, little attention has been paid to the understanding of their associated feature spaces. In this paper, we explore the potential of adopting an operator-valued kernel feature space perspective for the analysis of functional data. We then extend the Regularized Least Squares Classification (RLSC) algorithm to cover situations where there are multiple functions per observation. Experiments on a sound recognition problem show that the proposed method outperforms the classical RLSC algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Bordeaux", "Lille University of Science and Technology", "\u00c9cole centrale de Lille", "LITIS, UFR de S ...
