{"title": "Global Learning of Focused Entailment Graphs.", "fields": ["integer", "predicate", "transitive relation", "feedback arc set", "mixed graph"], "abstract": "We propose a global algorithm for learning entailment relations between predicates. We define a graph structure over predicates that represents entailment relations as directed edges, and use a global transitivity constraint on the graph to learn the optimal set of edges, by formulating the optimization problem as an Integer Linear Program. We motivate this graph with an application that provides a hierarchical summary for a set of propositions that focus on a target concept, and show that our global algorithm improves performance by more than 10% over baseline algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jonathan Berant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berant:Jonathan", "Ido Dagan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dagan:Ido", "Jacob Goldberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldberger:Jacob"], "pages": 10}
