{"title": "Synthesis of Optimal Interfaces for Hierarchical Scheduling with Resources.", "fields": ["bounded set", "synchronization", "schedule", "resource allocation", "semaphore"], "abstract": "This paper presents algorithms that (1) facilitate system-independent synthesis of timing-interfaces for subsystems and (2) system-level selection of interfaces to minimize CPU load. The results presented are developed for hierarchical fixed-priority scheduling of subsystems that may share logical recourses (i.e. semaphores). We show that the use of shared resources results in a tradeoff problem, where resource locking times can be traded for CPU allocation, complicating the problem of finding the optimal interface configuration subject to schedulability. This paper presents a methodology where such a tradeoff can be effectively explored. It first synthesizes a bounded set of interface-candidates for each subsystem, independently of the final system, such that the set contains the interface that minimizes system load for any given system. Then, integrating subsystems into a system, it finds the optimal selection of interfaces. Our algorithms have linear complexity to the number of tasks involved. Thus, our approach is also suitable for adaptable and reconfigurable systems.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["KAIST", "M\u00e4lardalen University College", "M\u00e4lardalen University College", "M\u00e4lardalen University College"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Insik Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Insik", "Moris Behnam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Behnam:Moris", "Thomas Nolte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nolte:Thomas", "Mikael Nolin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nolin:Mikael"], "pages": 12}
