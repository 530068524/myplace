Parameters of both transformations are jointly learned to maximize the (regularized) total correlation. It can be viewed as a nonlinear extension of the linear method canonical correlation analysis (CCA). It is an alternative to the nonparametric method kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) for learning correlated nonlinear transformations. Unlike KCCA, DCCA does not require an inner product, and has the advantages of a parametric method: training time scales well with data size and the training data need not be referenced when computing the representations of unseen instances. In experiments on two real-world datasets, we find that DCCA learns representations with significantly higher correlation than those learned by CCA and KCCA. We also introduce a novel non-saturating sigmoid function based on the cube root that may be useful more generally in feedforward neural networks.", "citation": "Citations (457)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "University of Washington", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Rochester", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Humboldt State University", "Humboldt State University", "University of Helsinki", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Tomer Michaeli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michaeli:Tomer", "Weiran Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Weiran", "Karen Livescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Livescu:Karen"], "pages": 10}
