In this paper, we propose  FlexRecs , a framework that decouples the definition of a recommendation process from its execution and supports flexible recommendations over structured data. In FlexRecs, a recommendation approach can be defined declaratively as a high-level parameterized workflow comprising traditional relational operators and new operators that generate or combine recommendations. We describe a prototype flexible recommendation engine that realizes the proposed framework and we present example workflows and experimental results that show its potential for capturing multiple, existing or novel, recommendations easily and having a flexible recommendation system that combines extensibility with reasonable performance.", "citation": "Citations (133)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Georgia Koutrika.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koutrika:Georgia", "Benjamin Bercovitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bercovitz:Benjamin", "Hector Garcia-Molina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia=Molina:Hector"], "pages": 14}
