{"title": "Designing a Willing-to-Use-in-Public Hand Gestural Interaction Technique for Smart Glasses.", "fields": ["multimodal interaction", "speaker recognition", "design elements and principles", "scrolling", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "Smart glasses suffer from obtrusive or cumbersome interaction techniques. Studies show that people are not willing to publicly use, for example, voice control or mid-air gestures in front of the face. Some techniques also hamper the high degree of freedom of the glasses. In this paper, we derive design principles for socially acceptable, yet versatile, interaction techniques for smart glasses based on a survey of related work. We propose an exemplary design, based on a haptic glove integrated with smart glasses, as an embodiment of the design principles. The design is further refined into three interaction scenarios: text entry, scrolling, and point-and-select. Through a user study conducted in a public space we show that the interaction technique is considered unobtrusive and socially acceptable. Furthermore, the performance of the technique in text entry is comparable to state-of-the-art techniques. We conclude by reflecting on the advantages of the proposed design.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki", "University of Padua", "University of Padua", "University of Helsinki"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yi-Ta Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Yi=Ta", "Antti Jylh\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jylh=auml=:Antti", "Valeria Orso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orso:Valeria", "Luciano Gamberini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gamberini:Luciano", "Giulio Jacucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacucci:Giulio"], "pages": 13}
