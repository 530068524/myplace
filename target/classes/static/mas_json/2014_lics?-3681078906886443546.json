We prove the soundness of such techniques in a fibrational setting, building on the seminal work of Hermida and Jacobs. This allows us to systematically obtain up-to techniques not only for bisimilarity but for a large class of coinductive predicates modelled as coalgebras. By tuning the parameters of our framework, we obtain novel techniques for unary predicates and nominal automata, a variant of the GSOS rule format for similarity, and a new categorical treatment of weak bisimilarity.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Lyon", "University of Lyon", "University of Lyon", "Leiden University"], "authors": ["Filippo Bonchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonchi:Filippo", "Daniela Petrisan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrisan:Daniela", "Damien Pous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pous:Damien", "Jurriaan Rot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rot:Jurriaan"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
