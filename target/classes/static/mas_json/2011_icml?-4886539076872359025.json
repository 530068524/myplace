{"title": "Minimal Loss Hashing for Compact Binary Codes.", "fields": ["feature hashing", "hopscotch hashing", "dynamic perfect hashing", "k independent hashing", "hamming space"], "abstract": "We propose a method for learning similarity-preserving hash functions that map high-dimensional data onto binary codes. The formulation is based on structured prediction with latent variables and a hinge-like loss function. It is efficient to train for large datasets, scales well to large code lengths, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (518)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Mohammad Norouzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norouzi_0002:Mohammad", "David J.
