{"title": "A tale of three graphs: Sampling design on hybrid social-affiliation networks.", "fields": ["sampling design", "graph", "complex network", "bipartite graph"], "abstract": "Random walk-based graph sampling methods have become increasingly popular and important for characterizing large-scale complex networks. While powerful, they are known to exhibit problems when the graph is loosely connected, which slows down the convergence of a random walk and can result in poor estimation accuracy. In this work, we observe that many graphs under study, called target graphs, usually do not exist in isolation. In many situations, a target graph is often related to an auxiliary graph and an affiliation graph, and the target graph becomes better connected when viewed from these three graphs as a whole, or what we called a hybrid social-affiliation network. This viewpoint brings extra benefits to the graph sampling framework, e.g., when directly sampling a target graph is difficult or inefficient, we can efficiently sample it with the assistance of auxiliary and affiliation graphs. We propose three sampling methods on such a hybrid social-affiliation network to estimate target graph characteristics, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, to demonstrate the effectiveness of these new sampling methods.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Huawei", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Junzhou Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Junzhou", "John C.
