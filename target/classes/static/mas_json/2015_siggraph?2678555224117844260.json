{"title": "Dynamic realistic lip animation using a limited number of control points.", "fields": ["rendering", "computer facial animation", "animation", "intelligibility", "viseme"], "abstract": "One main concern of audiovisual speech research is the intelligibility of audiovisual speech (i.e., talking head). In fact, lip reading is crucial for challenged population as hard of hearing people. For audiovisual synthesis and animation, this suggests that one should pay careful attention to modeling the region of the face that participates actively during speech. Above all, a facial animation system needs extremely good representations of lip motion and deformation in order to achieve realism and effective communication.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Lorraine", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "authors": ["Slim Ouni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouni:Slim", "Guillaume Gris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gris:Guillaume"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
