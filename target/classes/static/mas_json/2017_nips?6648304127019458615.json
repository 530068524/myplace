{"title": "A Sharp Error Analysis for the Fused Lasso, with Application to Approximate Changepoint Screening.", "fields": ["exponential family", "minimax", "estimator", "word error rate", "lasso"], "abstract": "In the 1-dimensional multiple changepoint detection problem, we derive a new fast error rate for the fused lasso estimator, under the assumption that the mean vector has a sparse number of changepoints. This rate is seen to be suboptimal (compared to the minimax rate) by only a factor of $\\log\\log{n}$. Our proof technique is centered around a novel construction that we call a lower interpolant. We extend our results to misspecified models and exponential family distributions. We also describe the implications of our error analysis for the approximate screening of changepoints.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Davis", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kevin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Kevin", "James Sharpnack.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharpnack:James", "Alessandro Rinaldo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rinaldo:Alessandro", "Ryan J.
