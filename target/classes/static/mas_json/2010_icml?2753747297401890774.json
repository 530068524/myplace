{"title": "An Analysis of the Convergence of Graph Laplacians.", "fields": ["graph bandwidth", "quartic graph", "coxeter graph", "integral graph", "null graph"], "abstract": "Existing approaches to analyzing the asymptotics of graph Laplacians typically assume a well-behaved kernel function with smoothness assumptions. We remove the smoothness assumption and generalize the analysis of graph Laplacians to include previously unstudied graphs including kNN graphs. We also introduce a kernel-free framework to analyze graph constructions with shrinking neighborhoods in general and apply it to analyze locally linear embedding (LLE). We also describe how, for a given limit operator, desirable properties such as a convergent spectrum and sparseness can be achieved by choosing the appropriate graph construction.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Daniel Ting.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Ting:Daniel", "Ling Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Ling", "Michael I.
