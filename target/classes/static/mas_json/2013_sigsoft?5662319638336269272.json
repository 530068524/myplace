They have proven themselves to be useful in many domains, but at the same time have not (in general) experienced any notable concrete integration into a development environment. This is partly due to the inherent complexity of the tools themselves, as well as due to other intangible factors. Such factors usually tend to include questions about the return on investment of the tool and the value the tool provides in a development environment. In this paper, we present an empirical model for evaluating static analysis tools from the perspective of the economic value they provide. We further apply this model to a case study of the Static Driver Verier (SDV) tool that ships with the Windows Driver Kit and show the usefulness of the model and the tool.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Rahul Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Rahul", "Aditya V.
