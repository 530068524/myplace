{"title": "Minimizing makespan and total completion time in MapReduce-like systems.", "fields": ["job shop scheduling", "heuristic", "bottleneck", "parallelizable manifold", "big data"], "abstract": "Effectiveness of MapReduce as a big data processing framework depends on efficiencies of scale for both map and reduce phases. While most map tasks are preemptive and parallelizable, the reduce tasks typically are not easily decomposed and often become a bottleneck due to constraints of data locality and task complexity. By assuming that reduce tasks are non-parallelizable, we study offline scheduling of minimizing makespan and minimizing total completion time, respectively. Both preemptive and non-preemptive reduce tasks are considered. On makespan minimization, for preemptive version we design an algorithm and prove its optimality, for non-preemptive version we design an approximation algorithm with the worst ratio of 3 2 \u2212 1 2h where h is the number of machines. On total complete time minimization, for non-preemptive version we devise an approximation algorithm with worst case ratio of 2\u2212 1 h , and for preemptive version we devise a heuristic. We confirm that our algorithms outperform state-of-art schedulers through experiments.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "Zhejiang Sci-Tech University", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Yuqing Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yuqing", "Yiwei Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yiwei", "Weili Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Weili", "Ling Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Ling", "Ankur Teredesai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teredesai:Ankur", "Deying Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Deying", "Wonjun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wonjun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
