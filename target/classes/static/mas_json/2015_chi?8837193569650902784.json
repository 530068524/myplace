Recent HCI studies involving technologies using specific quitting techniques such as social support and SMS messaging to help people quit have reported some success. Early studies using computer generated print material report significant success of tailored versus non-tailored material, however, there is limited understanding on what aspects of digitally delivered quitting assistance should be tailored and how. To address this, we have conducted an empirical investigation with smokers to identify perceived importance of different types of help when quitting and the potential role of technology in providing such help. We found that people are highly individual in their approach to quitting and the kind of help they regard as relevant to their situation. Our contribution is a collection of empirically derived themes for tailoring smoking cessation apps to individual quitting needs.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jeni Paay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paay:Jeni", "Jesper Kjeldskov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kjeldskov:Jesper", "Mikael B.
