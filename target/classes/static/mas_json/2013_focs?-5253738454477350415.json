{"title": "An LMP O(log n)-Approximation Algorithm for Node Weighted Prize Collecting Steiner Tree.", "fields": ["graph theory", "approximation algorithm", "steiner tree problem", "shortest path tree", "vertex"], "abstract": "In the node-weighted prize-collecting Steiner tree problem (NW-PCST) we are given an undirected graph G = (V, E), non-negative costs c(u) and penalties \u03c0(u) for each u \u2208 V . The goal is to find a tree T that minimizes the total cost of the vertices spanned by T plus the total penalty of vertices not in T. This problem is well-known to be set-cover hard to approximate. Moss and Rabani (STOC'01) presented a primal-dual Lagrangean-multiplier-preserving O(ln |V |)-approximation algorithm for this problem. We show a serious problem with the algorithm, and present a new, fundamentally different primal-dual method achieving the same performance guarantee. Our algorithm introduces several novel features to the primal-dual method that may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Jochen K\u00f6nemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=nemann:Jochen", "Sina Sadeghian Sadeghabad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadeghabad:Sina_Sadeghian", "Laura Sanit\u00e0.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanit=agrave=:Laura"], "pages": 10}
