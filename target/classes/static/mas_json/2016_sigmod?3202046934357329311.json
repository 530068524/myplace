{"title": "Quegel: A General-Purpose System for Querying Big Graphs.", "fields": ["graph", "graph rewriting", "execution model", "graph database", "graph operations"], "abstract": "Inspired by Google's Pregel, many distributed graph processing systems have been developed recently to process big graphs. These systems expose a vertex-centric programming interface to users, where a programmer thinks like a vertex when designing parallel graph algorithms. However, existing systems are designed for tasks where most vertices in a graph participate in the computation, and they are not suitable for processing light-workload graph queries which only access a small portion of vertices. This is because their programming model can seriously under-utilize the resources in a cluster for processing graph queries. In this demonstration, we introduce a general-purpose system for querying big graphs, called Quegel, which treats queries as first-class citizens in the design of its computing model. Quegel adopts a novel superstep-sharing execution model to overcome the weaknesses of existing systems. We demonstrate it is user-friendly to write parallel graph-querying programs with Quegel's interface; and we also show that Quegel is able to achieve real-time response time in various applications, including the two applications that we plan to demonstrate: point-to-point shortest-path queries and XML keyword search.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Qizhen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qizhen", "Da Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Da", "James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James"], "pages": 4}
