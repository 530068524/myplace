Our protocol leaks no more to any active adversary than an ideal functionality for $$\\mathscr {F}$$ provided Alice and Bob have the cryptographic resources for active secure two-party classical computation. Our protocol is constructed from the protocol for the same task secure against specious adversaries presented in [4].", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Aarhus University", "Universit\u00e9 de D ... ntreal, Canada"], "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dupuis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dupuis:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Jesper Buus Nielsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nielsen:Jesper_Buus", "Louis Salvail.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salvail:Louis"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 18}
