{"title": "Supersense Embeddings: A Unified Model for Supersense Interpretation, Prediction, and Utilization.", "fields": ["machine translation", "vector space", "question answering", "unified model", "embedding"], "abstract": "Coarse-grained semantic categories such as supersenses have proven useful for a range of downstream tasks such as question answering or machine translation. To date, no effort has been put into integrating the supersenses into distributional word representations. We present a novel joint embedding model of words and supersenses, providing insights into the relationship between words and supersenses in the same vector space. Using these embeddings in a deep neural network model, we demonstrate that the supersense enrichment leads to a significant improvement in a range of downstream classification tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Lucie Flekova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flekova:Lucie", "Iryna Gurevych.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurevych:Iryna"], "pages": -1}
