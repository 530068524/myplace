{"title": "Requirements fixation.", "fields": ["originality", "randomized controlled trial", "creativity", "cognitive bias", "framing"], "abstract": "There is a broad consensus that understanding system desiderata (requirements) and design creativity are both important for software engineering success. However, little research has addressed the relationship between design creativity and the way requirements are framed or presented. This paper therefore aims to investigate the possibility that the way desiderata are framed or presented can affect design creativity. Forty two participants took part in a randomized control trial where one group received desiderata framed as \u201crequirements\u201d while the other received desiderata framed as \u201cideas\u201d. Participants produced design concepts which were judged for originality. Participants who received requirements framing produced significantly less original designs than participants who received ideas framing (Mann-Whitney U=116.5, p=0.004). We conclude that framing desiderata as \u201crequirements\u201d may cause requirements fixation where designers\u2019 preoccupation with satisfying explicit requirements inhibits their creativity.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["Rahul Mohanani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohanani:Rahul", "Paul Ralph.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ralph:Paul", "Ben Shreeve.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shreeve:Ben"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
