To address limitations to wire delay scalability and increasing bandwidth demands, state-of-the-art on-chip networks use a modular packet-switched design with routers at every hop which allow sharing of network channels over multiple packet flows. This, however, leads to packets going through a complex router pipeline at every hop, resulting in the overall communication energy/delay being dominated by the router overhead, as opposed to just wire energy/delay.", "citation": "Citations (124)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "Qualcomm", "Qualcomm", "University of Seville", "University of Seville", "International Facility Management Association", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Nikia Corporation", "Nikia Corporation", "Nikia Corporation", "Nikia Corporation", "Nikia Corporation"], "authors": ["Amit Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0002:Amit", "Li-Shiuan Peh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peh:Li=Shiuan", "Niraj K.
