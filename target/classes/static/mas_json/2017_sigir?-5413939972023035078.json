To build a conversation system with adequate intelligence is challenging, and requires abundant resources including an acquisition of big data and interdisciplinary techniques, such as information retrieval and natural language processing. Along with the prosperity of Web 2.0, the massive data available greatly facilitate data-driven methods such as deep learning for human-computer conversation systems. Owing to the diversity of Web resources, a retrieval-based conversation system will come up with at least some results from the immense repository for any user inputs. Given a human issued message, i.e., query, a traditional conversation system would provide a response after adequate training and learning of how to respond. In this paper, we propose a new task for conversation systems: joint learning of response ranking featured with next utterance suggestion. We assume that the new conversation mode is more proactive and keeps user engaging. We examine the assumption in experiments. Besides, to address the joint learning task, we propose a novel Dual-LSTM Chain Model to couple response ranking and next utterance suggestion simultaneously. From the experimental results, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed task and the effectiveness of the proposed model.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Rui Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Rui", "Dongyan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Dongyan", "Weinan E......http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/E=:Weinan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
