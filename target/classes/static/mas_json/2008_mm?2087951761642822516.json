This means that supporting region-of-interest cropping will become more important in the future. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to support region-of-interest adaptation of stored video. The proposed approach creates a compression compliant stream (e.g., MPEG-2), while still allowing it to be cropped. Using data from a motion-picture industry video camera, we show that the proposed approach, while adding a small amount of overhead, can be used to efficiently crop large resolution video into a smaller stream.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Portland State University", "Portland State University", "Portland State University", "Portland State University", "Portland State University", "Portland State University", "Portland State University", "Portland State University"], "authors": ["Wu-chi Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Wu=chi", "Thanh Dang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dang:Thanh", "John Kassebaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kassebaum:John", "Tim Bauman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauman:Tim"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
