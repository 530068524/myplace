{"title": "RST 3D: A Comprehensive Gesture Set for Multitouch 3D Navigation.", "fields": ["interaction design", "rendering", "stereoscopy", "gesture", "3d interaction"], "abstract": "We present a comprehensive multitouch input mapping for 3D navigation of multiscale 3D models. In contrast to prior work, our technique offers explicit control over 3D rotation, 3D translation, and uniform scaling with manipulative gestures that do not require graphical widgets. Our proposed technique is consistent with the established RST mapping (rotation, scaling, translation) for 2D mul-titouch input and follows suggestions from prior work on multitouch 3D interaction. Our implementation includes a rendering technique that can reduce perceptual conflicts of 3D touch input on stereoscopic displays. We also report on two user studies that informed the suggested interaction design and confirmed its usability.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Bauhaus University, Weimar", "Bauhaus University, Weimar", "Bauhaus University, Weimar", "Bauhaus University, Weimar"], "authors": ["Alexander Kulik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulik:Alexander", "Andr\u00e9 Kunert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kunert:Andr=eacute=", "Magdalena Keil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keil:Magdalena", "Bernd Froehlich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Froehlich_0001:Bernd"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
