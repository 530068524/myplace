{"title": "The implications of offering more disclosure choices for social location sharing.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "computer science", "data mining"], "abstract": "We compared two privacy configuration styles for specifying rules for social sharing one's past locations. Our findings suggest that location-sharing applications (LSAs) which support varying levels of location granularities are associated with sharing rules that are less convoluted, are less likely to be negatively phrased, and can lead to more open sharing; users are also more comfortable with these rules. These findings can help inform LSA privacy designs.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Karen P.
