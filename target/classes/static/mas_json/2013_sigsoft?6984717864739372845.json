UML state machines are specifically used in modeling dynamic behaviors of classes. It has been widely agreed that verification of system designs at an early stage will dramatically reduce the development cost. Tool support for verification UML designs can also encourage consistent usage of UML diagrams throughout the software development procedure. In this work, we present a tool, named USMMC, which turns model checking of UML state machines into practice. USMMC is a self-contained toolkit, which provides editing, interactive simulation as well as powerful model checking support for UML state machines. The evaluation results show the effectiveness and scalability of our tool.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Nanyang Technological University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "sigsoft", "authors": ["Shuang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shuang", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Yang", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Manchun Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Manchun", "Bimlesh Wadhwa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wadhwa:Bimlesh", "Jin Song Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jin_Song"], "pages": 4}
