However, the typically small battery of such systems is often making continuous detection impractical. The strain on the battery can be reduced if the sensor setting is adapted to each context. We propose a method that efficiently finds near-optimal sensor settings. It uses Markov chains to simulate the behaviour of the system in different configurations, and multi-objective genetic algorithm to find a set of good non-dominated configurations.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Jo\u017eef Stefan In ... ljana, Slovenia", "Jo\u017eef Stefan In ... ljana, Slovenia"], "authors": ["Vito Janko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Janko:Vito", "Mitja Lustrek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lustrek:Mitja"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
