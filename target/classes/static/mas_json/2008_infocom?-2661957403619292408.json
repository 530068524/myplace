{"title": "DRIP: A Dynamic VoRonoi RegIons-Based Publish/Subscribe Protocol in Mobile Networks.", "fields": ["mobile ad hoc network", "voronoi diagram", "cellular network", "middleware", "asynchronous communication"], "abstract": "The publish/subscribe (pub/sub for short) paradigm is used to deliver events from a source to interested clients in an asynchronous way. Recently, extending a pub/sub system in wireless networks has become a promising topic. However, most existing works focus on pub/sub systems in infrastructured wireless networks. To adapt pub/sub systems to mobile ad hoc networks, we propose DRIP, a dynamic Voronoi region-based pub/sub protocol. In our design, the network is dynamically divided into several Voronoi regions after choosing proper nodes as broker nodes. Each broker node is used to collect subscriptions and detected events, as well as efficiently notify subscribers with matched events in its Voronoi region. Other nodes join their nearest broker nodes to submit subscriptions, publish events, and wait for notifications of their requested events. Broker nodes cooperate with each other for sharing subscriptions and useful events. Our proposal includes two major components: a Voronoi regions construction protocol, and a delivery mechanism that implements the pub/sub paradigm. The effectiveness of DRIP is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Florida Atlantic University", "Florida Atlantic University"], "authors": ["Quan Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan_0003:Quan", "Jie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Jie"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
