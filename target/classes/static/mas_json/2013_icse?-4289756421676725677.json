Numerous powerful model inference algorithms have been proposed to aid developers in log analysis and system understanding. Unfortunately, existing algorithms are difficult to understand, extend, and compare. This paper presents InvariMint, an approach to specify model inference algorithms declaratively. We applied InvariMint to two model inference algorithms and present evaluation results to illustrate that InvariMint (1) leads to new fundamental insights and better understanding of existing algorithms, (2) simplifies creation of new algorithms, including hybrids that extend existing algorithms, and (3) makes it easy to compare and contrast previously published algorithms. Finally, algorithms specified with InvariMint can outperform their procedural versions.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Ivan Beschastnikh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beschastnikh:Ivan", "Yuriy Brun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brun:Yuriy", "Jenny Abrahamson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abrahamson:Jenny", "Michael D.
