{"title": "Haptic Retargeting: Dynamic Repurposing of Passive Haptics for Enhanced Virtual Reality Experiences.", "fields": ["repurposing", "stereotaxy", "virtual image", "limiting", "retargeting"], "abstract": "Manipulating a virtual object with appropriate passive haptic cues provides a satisfying sense of presence in virtual reality. However, scaling such experiences to support multiple virtual objects is a challenge as each one needs to be accompanied with a precisely-located haptic proxy object. We propose a solution that overcomes this limitation by hacking human perception. We have created a framework for repurposing passive haptics, called haptic retargeting, that leverages the dominance of vision when our senses conflict. With haptic retargeting, a single physical prop can provide passive haptics for multiple virtual objects. We introduce three approaches for dynamically aligning physical and virtual objects: world manipulation, body manipulation and a hybrid technique which combines both world and body manipulation. Our study results indicate that all our haptic retargeting techniques improve the sense of presence when compared to typical wand-based 3D control of virtual objects. Furthermore, our hybrid haptic retargeting achieved the highest satisfaction and presence scores while limiting the visible side-effects during interaction.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Waterloo", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mahdi Azmandian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azmandian:Mahdi", "Mark Hancock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hancock:Mark", "Hrvoje Benko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benko:Hrvoje", "Eyal Ofek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ofek:Eyal", "Andrew D.
