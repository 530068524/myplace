Our exploratory investigation builds upon a comparative, between subject experiment benchmarking different interaction features of a custom public installation that visualized a series of urban datasets. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the in-the-wild versus the controlled in-the-wild methodologies, we compared the resulting findings in terms of participant engagement, insight generation, and social interaction. We propose that a controlled in-the-wild study offers a viable alternative when evaluating more complex interaction methods in public space, hereby potentially reducing the practical efforts of in-the-wild studies to involve participants.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sandy Claes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Claes:Sandy", "Niels Wouters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wouters:Niels", "Karin Slegers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slegers:Karin", "Andrew Vande Moere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moere:Andrew_Vande"], "pages": 4}
