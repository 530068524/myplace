In this work we classify the power of such trusted 2-party setup functionalities. We show that nearly every setup is either useless ideal access to the setup is equivalent to having no setup at all or else complete composably secure protocols for all tasks exist in the presence of the setup. We further argue that those setups which are neither complete nor useless are highly unnatural.\n\nThe main technical contribution in this work is an almost-total characterization of completeness for 2-party setups. Our characterization treats setup functionalities as black-boxes, and therefore is the first work to classify completeness of arbitrary setup functionalitiesi.e., randomized, reactive, and having behavior that depends on the global security parameter.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Montana"], "authors": ["Mike Rosulek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosulek:Mike"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 18}
