This paper introduces new methods for label ranking that complement and improve upon existing approaches. More specifically, we propose extensions of two methods that have been used extensively for classification and regression so far, namely instance-based learning and decision tree induction. The unifying element of the two methods is a procedure for locally estimating predictive probability models for label rankings.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "departments": ["University of Marburg", "University of Marburg", "University of Marburg"], "authors": ["Weiwei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Weiwei", "Jens C.
