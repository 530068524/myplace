{"title": "Semi-Automating Pragmatic Reuse Tasks.", "fields": ["source code", "software", "reuse", "software maintenance", "automation"], "abstract": "Developers undertaking a pragmatic reuse task must collect and reason about information that is spread throughout the source code of a system before they can understand the scope of their task. Once they have this understanding, they can undertake the manual process of actually reusing the source code within their system. We have created a tool environment to help developers plan and perform pragmatic reuse tasks enabling them to reason about and perform larger reuse tasks than they generally feel comfortable attempting otherwise.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Reid Holmes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holmes:Reid", "Robert J.
