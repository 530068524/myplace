{"title": "Representatively memorable: sampling the right phrase set to get the text entry experiment right.", "fields": ["phrase", "representativeness heuristic", "sampling", "information retrieval", "source code"], "abstract": "In text entry experiments, memorability is a desired property of the phrases used as stimuli. Unfortunately, to date there is no automated method to achieve this effect. As a result, researchers have to use either manually curated English-only phrase sets or sampling procedures that do not guarantee phrases being memorable. In response to this need, we present a novel sampling method based on two core ideas: a multiple regression model over language-independent features, and the statistical analysis of the corpus from which phrases will be drawn. Our results show that researchers can finally use a method to successfully curate their own stimuli targeting potentially any language or domain. The source code as well as our phrase sets are publicly available.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Valencia", "Polytechnic University of Valencia"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Luis A.
