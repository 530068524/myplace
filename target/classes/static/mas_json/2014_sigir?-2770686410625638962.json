Although a partition-based approach accelerates this process by simplifying parallelism management and avoiding unnecessary I/O and comparison, it is still challenging to balance the computation load among parallel machines with a distributed architecture. This is mainly due to the variation in partition sizes and irregular dissimilarity relationship in large datasets. This paper presents a two-stage heuristic algorithm to improve the load balance and shorten the overall processing time. We analyze the optimality and competitiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness using several datasets. We also describe a static partitioning algorithm to even out the partition sizes while detecting more dissimilar pairs. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms a previously developed solution by up to 41% in the tested cases.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Xun Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xun", "Maha Alabduljalil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alabduljalil:Maha", "Xin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xin", "Tao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0009:Tao"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
