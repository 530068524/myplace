The stability results have been obtained by a fixed point method. This method introduces a metrical context and shows that the stability is related to some fixed point of a suitable operator.", "citation": "Citations (204)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Pedagogical University", "Pedagogical University", "Russian Academy of Sciences", "Peking University", "University of Calgary", "University of Tehran", "University of Tehran", "University of Calgary", "Aix-Marseille University", "Aix-Marseille University", "Departamentul d ... i\u015foara, Romania", "Facultatea de M ... i\u015foara, Romania"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Nikolaj Bj\u00f8rner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bj=oslash=rner:Nikolaj", "Joe Hendrix.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hendrix:Joe"], "pages": 16}
