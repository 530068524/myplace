{"title": "Pictor: an interactive system for importing data from a website.", "fields": ["data mining", "exploit", "web page", "information retrieval", "information extraction"], "abstract": "We present a demonstration of an interactive wrapper induction system, called  Pictor , which is able to minimize labeling cost, yet extract data with high accuracy from a website. Our demonstration will introduce two proposed technologies:  record-level wrappers  and a  wrapper-assisted labeling  strategy. These approaches allow Pictor to exploit previously generated wrappers, in order to predict similar labels in a partially labeled webpage or a completely new webpage. Our experiment results show the effectiveness of the Pictor system.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Shuyi Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Shuyi", "Matthew R.
