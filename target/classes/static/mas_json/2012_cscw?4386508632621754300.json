We frame our discussion by highlighting the relation between the original exercises and game interactions, and by analyzing an example exergame which is successfully transformed from its original solitary exercise. We present a user study of the exergame that evaluates the need for holistic transformation strategies from solitary exercises into social exergames.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Taiwoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Taiwoo", "Chungkuk Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Chungkuk", "Sungwon Peter Choe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choe:Sungwon_Peter", "Byunglim Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Byunglim", "Junehwa Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Junehwa"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
