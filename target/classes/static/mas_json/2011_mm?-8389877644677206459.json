In order to better represent and discriminate images from different classes, we advance BOF and explore the self-similarities of visual words for improved performance. The proposed  self-similarity hypercubes  (SSH) model, which observes the concurrent occurrences of visual words in an image, is able to describe the structural information of the BOF in an image. Our experiments confirm that our SSH provides additional and complementary information to BOF and thus results in improved classification performance. Unlike most prior methods requiring extraction or integration of multiple types of features for similar improvements, our SSH works in the same domain as the BOF does. Moreover, we do not limit the use of our SSH to any particular type of image descriptors, and its generalization is also verified.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica"], "authors": ["Chih-Fan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chih=Fan", "Yu-Chiang Frank Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yu=Chiang_Frank"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
