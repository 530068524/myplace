We consider three well-studied notions of structured data that aim at characterizing real-world inputs:\u2022 Distribution Stability (introduced by Awasthi, Blum, and Sheffet, FOCS 2010)\u2022 Spectral Separability (introduced by Kumar and Kannan, FOCS 2010)\u2022 Perturbation Resilience (introduced by Bilu and Linial, ICS 2010)We prove structural results showing that inputs satisfying at least one of the conditions are inherently local. Namely, for any such input, any local optimum is close both in term of structure and in term of objective value to the global optima.As a corollary we obtain that the widely-used Local Search algorithm has strong performance guarantees for both the tasks of recovering the underlying optimal clustering and obtaining a clustering of small cost. This is a significant step toward understanding the success of local search heuristics in clustering applications.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "Technical University of Dortmund"], "authors": ["Vincent Cohen-Addad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen=Addad:Vincent", "Chris Schwiegelshohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwiegelshohn:Chris"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
