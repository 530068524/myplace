The object moves relative to background motion at some unknown time in the video, and the goal is to detect and segment the object as soon it moves in an online manner. Due to unreliability of motion between frames, more than two frames are needed to reliably detect the object. Our method is designed to detect the object(s) with minimum delay, i.e., frames after the object moves, constraining the false alarms. Experiments on a new extensive dataset for moving object detection show that our method achieves less delay for all false alarm constraints than existing state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dong Lao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lao:Dong", "Ganesh Sundaramoorthi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundaramoorthi:Ganesh"], "pages": 10}
