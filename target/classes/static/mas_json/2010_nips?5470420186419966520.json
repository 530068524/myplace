Current research mainly focus on avoiding the former. We attempt to utilize the geometric distribution of instances inside positive bags to avoid both the former and the latter. Based on kernel principal component analysis, we define a projection constraint for each positive bag to classify its constituent instances far away from the separating hyperplane while place positive instances and negative instances at opposite sides. We apply the Constrained Concave-Convex Procedure to solve the resulted problem. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach offers improved generalization performance.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Yanjun Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Yanjun", "Qing Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Qing", "Jue Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0004:Jue"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
