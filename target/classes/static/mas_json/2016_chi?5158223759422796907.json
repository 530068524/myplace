{"title": "Investigating the Heart Pump Implant Decision Process: Opportunities for Decision Support Tools to Help.", "fields": ["clinical decision support system", "service design", "business decision mapping", "r cast", "decision engineering"], "abstract": "Clinical decision support tools (DSTs) are computational systems that aid healthcare decision-making. While effective in labs, almost all these systems failed when they moved into clinical practice. Healthcare researchers speculated it is most likely due to a lack of user-centered HCI considerations in the design of these systems. This paper describes a field study investigating how clinicians make a heart pump implant decision with a focus on how to best integrate an intelligent DST into their work process. Our findings reveal a lack of perceived need for and trust of machine intelligence, as well as many barriers to computer use at the point of clinical decision-making. These findings suggest an alternative perspective to the traditional use models, in which clinicians engage with DSTs at the point of making a decision. We identify situations across patients' healthcare trajectories when decision supports would help, and we discuss new forms it might take in these situations.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Department of B ... sburgh, PA, USA", "Department of B ... sburgh, PA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Qian Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Qian", "John Zimmerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmerman:John", "Aaron Steinfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinfeld:Aaron", "Lisa Carey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carey:Lisa", "James F.
