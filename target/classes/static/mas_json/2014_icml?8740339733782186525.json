Its posterior is intractable and so far only MCMC methods were used for inference. Because of very different nature of ddCRP no prior developments in variational methods for Bayesian nonparametrics are appliable. In this paper we propose novel variational inference for important sequential case of ddCRP (seqddCRP) by revealing its connection with Laplacian of random graph constructed by the process. We develop efficient algorithm for optimizing variational lower bound and demonstrate its efficiency comparing to Gibbs sampler. We also apply our variational approximation to CRP-equivalent seqddCRP-mixture model, where it could be considered as alternative to one based on truncated stick-breaking representation. This allowed us to achieve significantly better variational lower bound than variational approximation based on truncated stick breaking for Dirichlet process.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Russian Academy of Sciences", "Moscow State University", "National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics", "National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics", "National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Sergey Bartunov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartunov:Sergey", "Dmitry P.
