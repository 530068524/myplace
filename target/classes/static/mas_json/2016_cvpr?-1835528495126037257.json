In this paper, we present Multitask Network Cascades for instance-aware semantic segmentation. Our model consists of three networks, respectively differentiating instances, estimating masks, and categorizing objects. These networks form a cascaded structure, and are designed to share their convolutional features. We develop an algorithm for the nontrivial end-to-end training of this causal, cascaded structure. Our solution is a clean, single-step training framework and can be generalized to cascades that have more stages. We demonstrate state-of-the-art instance-aware semantic segmentation accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Meanwhile, our method takes only 360ms testing an image using VGG-16, which is two orders of magnitude faster than previous systems for this challenging problem. As a by product, our method also achieves compelling object detection results which surpass the competitive Fast/Faster R-CNN systems. The method described in this paper is the foundation of our submissions to the MS COCO 2015 segmentation competition, where we won the 1st place.", "citation": "Citations (340)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jifeng Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Jifeng", "Kaiming He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Kaiming", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian"], "pages": 9}
