In this paper, we introduce a novel augmented reality paradigm called \u201cMind-Mirror\u201d which enables the experience of seeing \u201cthrough your own head\u201d, visualizing your brain \u201cin action and in situ\u201d. Our approach relies on the use of a semi-transparent mirror positioned in front of a computer screen. A virtual brain is displayed on screen and automatically follows the head movements using an optical face-tracking system. The brain activity is extracted and processed in real-time with the help of an electroencephalography cap (EEG) worn by the user. A rear view is also proposed thanks to an additional webcam recording the rear of the user's head. The use of EEG classification techniques enables to test a Neurofeedback scenario in which the user can train and progressively learn how to control different mental states, such as \u201cconcentrated\u201d versus \u201crelaxed\u201d. The results of a user study comparing a standard visualization used in Neurofeedback to our approach showed that the Mind-Mirror could be successfully used and that the participants have particularly appreciated its innovation and originality. We believe that, in addition to applications in Neurofeedback and Brain-Computer Interfaces, the Mind-Mirror could also be used as a novel visualization tool for education, training or entertainment applications.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Jonathan Mercier-Ganady.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mercier=Ganady:Jonathan", "Fabien Lotte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lotte:Fabien", "Emilie Loup-Escande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loup=Escande:Emilie", "Maud Marchal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marchal:Maud", "Anatole L\u00e9cuyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=eacute=cuyer:Anatole"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2014", "pages": 6}
