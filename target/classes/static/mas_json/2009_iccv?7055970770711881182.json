The subsequent stages of the process: feature detection, feature description, vocabulary construction and image representation are performed independent of the intentioned object classes to be detected. In such a framework, combining multiple cues such as shape and color often provides below-expected results.", "citation": "Citations (150)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Autonomous University of Barcelona"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Fahad Shahbaz Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Fahad_Shahbaz", "Joost van de Weijer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weijer:Joost_van_de", "Mar\u00eda Vanrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanrell_0001:Mar=iacute=a"], "pages": 8}
