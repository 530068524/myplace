Their work posited and validated the emph{steering law}, which described the relationship between path constraint, path length and the temporal cost of path traversal using a computer input device (e.g. a mouse). In this paper, we argue that the steering law fails to correctly model constrained paths of varying, arbitrary curvature, propose a new form of the law that accommodates these curved paths, and empirically validate our model.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mathieu Nancel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nancel:Mathieu", "Edward Lank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lank:Edward"], "pages": 11}
