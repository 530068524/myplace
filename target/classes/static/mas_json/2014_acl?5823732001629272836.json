Meanwhile, though typos are inevitable during user pinyin inputting, existing IMEs paid little attention to such big inconvenience. In this paper, motivated by a key equivalence of two decoding algorithms, we propose a joint graph model to globally optimize PTC and typo correction for IME. The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms both existing academic and commercial IMEs.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhongye Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Zhongye", "Hai Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Hai"], "pages": 12}
