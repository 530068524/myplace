We introduce motion denoising, which treats short-term changes as noise, long-term changes as signal, and re-renders a video to reveal the underlying long-term events. We demonstrate motion denoising for time-lapse videos. One of the characteristics of traditional time-lapse imagery is stylized jerkiness, where short-term changes in the scene appear as small and annoying jitters in the video, often obfuscating the underlying temporal events of interest. We apply motion denoising for resynthesizing time-lapse videos showing the long-term evolution of a scene with jerky short-term changes removed. We show that existing filtering approaches are often incapable of achieving this task, and present a novel computational approach to denoise motion without explicit motion analysis. We demonstrate promising experimental results on a set of challenging time-lapse sequences.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michael Rubinstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubinstein:Michael", "Ce Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ce", "Peter Sand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sand:Peter", "Fr\u00e9do Durand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durand:Fr=eacute=do", "William T.
