These advancements, coupled with vast hardware improvements, have drastic impact on, for example, program verification techniques and tools. The general availability of robust general purpose solvers have reduced a significant engineering overhead when designing and developing program verifiers. However, most solver implementations are designed to be used as a black box, and due to their aim as general purpose solvers, they often miss optimization opportunities that can be done by leveraging domain-specific knowledge.   This paper presents our effort to leverage domain-specific knowledge for optimizing symbolic execution (SymExe)-based analyses; we present optimization techniques incorporated as a lightweight semi-decision procedure (LDP) that provides up to an order of magnitude faster analysis time when analyzing realistic programs and well-known algorithms. LDP sits in the middle between a SymExe-based analysis tool and an existing SMT solver; it aims to reduce the number of solver calls by intercepting them and attempting to solve constraints using its lightweight deductive engine.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Kansas State University", "Kansas State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Jason Belt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belt:Jason", "Robby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robby:", "Xianghua Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Xianghua"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
