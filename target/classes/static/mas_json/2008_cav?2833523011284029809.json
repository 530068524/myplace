In order to verify nontrivial systems without solving their differential equations and without numerical errors, we use a continuous generalization of induction, for which our algorithm computes the required  differential invariants . As a means for combining local differential invariants into global system invariants in a sound way, our fixedpoint algorithm works with a compositional verification logic for hybrid systems. To improve the verification power, we further introduce a  saturation procedure that refines the system dynamics successively with differential invariants until safety becomes provable. By complementing our symbolic verification algorithm with a robust version of numerical falsification, we obtain a fast and sound verification procedure. We verify roundabout maneuvers in air traffic management and collision avoidance in train control.", "citation": "Citations (116)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Oldenburg", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Platzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Platzer:Andr=eacute=", "Edmund M.
