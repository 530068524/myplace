Based on in-depth understanding of the nature of the MEMS gyroscope and other IMU sensors, we propose A 3  - an accurate and automatic attitude detector for commodity smartphones. In the demo, we show the performance of our attitude tracking algorithm and its usability in attitude-based mobile applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Pengfei Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Pengfei", "Weiming Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Weiming", "Shiqi Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Shiqi", "Jiajue Ou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ou:Jiajue", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo", "Guobin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Guobin"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
