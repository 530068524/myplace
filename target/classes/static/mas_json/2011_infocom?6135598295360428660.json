{"title": "Wireless data multicasting with switched beamforming antennas.", "fields": ["communication complexity", "beamforming", "multicast", "bin packing problem", "partition"], "abstract": "Using beamforming antennas to improve wireless multicast transmissions has received considerable attention recently. The work in [7] proposes to partition all single-lobe beams into groups and to form composite multi-lobe beam patterns to transmit multicast traffic. The key challenge left is, how to partition the beams into multiple groups in order to minimize the total multicast delay. This work makes significant progress in both algorithmic and analytic aspects of the problem. We prove that, under the asymmetric power split (ASP) model, it is NP-hard to have ( 3 over 2 \u2212 e)-approximation algorithm for any e > 0. We then develop an APTAS, an asymptotic ( 3 over 2 + \u03b2)-approximation solution (where \u03b2 \u2265 0 depends on the wireless technology), and an asymptotic 2-approximation solution to the problem by relating the problem to a generalized version of the bin-packing problem. Extensive trace-driven simulations based on real-world channel measurements corroborate our analytical results by showing significant improvement compared to state of the art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Mobile Communic ... es America, USA", "Mobile Communic ... es America, USA", "Mobile Communic ... es America, USA", "Mobile Communic ... es America, USA"], "authors": ["Honghai Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Honghai", "Yuanxi Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yuanxi", "Karthikeyan Sundaresan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundaresan:Karthikeyan", "Sampath Rangarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangarajan:Sampath", "Baohua Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Baohua"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
