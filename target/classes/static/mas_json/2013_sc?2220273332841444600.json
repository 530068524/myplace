{"title": "COCA: online distributed resource management for cost minimization and carbon neutrality in data centers.", "fields": ["data center", "carbon footprint", "carbon neutrality", "online algorithm", "coca"], "abstract": "Due to the enormous energy consumption and associated environmental concerns, data centers have been increasingly pressured to reduce long-term net carbon footprint to zero, i.e.,  carbon neutrality . In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, called COCA (optimizing for COst minimization and CArbon neutrality), for minimizing data center operational cost while satisfying carbon neutrality without long-term future information. Unlike the existing research, COCA enables distributed server-level resource management: each server autonomously adjusts its processing speed and optimally decides the amount of workloads to process. We prove that COCA achieves a close-to-minimum operational cost (incorporating both electricity and delay costs) compared to the optimal algorithm with future information, while bounding the potential violation of carbon neutrality. We also perform trace-based simulation studies to complement the analysis, and the results show that COCA reduces cost by more than 25% (compared to state of the art) while resulting in a smaller carbon footprint.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Florida International University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Shaolei Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Shaolei", "Yuxiong He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yuxiong"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
