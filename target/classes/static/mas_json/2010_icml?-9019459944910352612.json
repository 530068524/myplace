We introduce a new class models, \"dynamical products of experts\" that treats the latent process over volatilities as an inverse Gamma process. We show that our multivariate volatility models significantly outperform all related Garch and stochastic volatility models which are in popular use in the quantitative finance community.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Yutian Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yutian", "Max Welling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welling:Max"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
