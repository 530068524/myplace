All state-of-the-art retrieval results have been achieved by methods that include a query expansion that brings a significant boost in performance. We introduce three extensions to automatic query expansion: (i) a method capable of preventing tf-idf failure caused by the presence of sets of correlated features (confusers), (ii) an improved spatial verification and re-ranking step that incrementally builds a statistical model of the query object and (iii) we learn relevant spatial context to boost retrieval performance. The three improvements of query expansion were evaluated on standard Paris and Oxford datasets according to a standard protocol, and state-of-the-art results were achieved.", "citation": "Citations (247)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ondrej Chum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chum:Ondrej", "Andrej Mikul\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mikul=iacute=k:Andrej", "Michal Perdoch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perdoch:Michal", "Jiri Matas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matas:Jiri"], "pages": 8}
