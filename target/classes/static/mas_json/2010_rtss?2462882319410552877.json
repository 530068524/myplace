We show that it is possible to bound the number of self-blocking occurrences that should be taken into consideration in the schedulability analysis of subsystems. Correspondingly, we present two novel schedulability analysis approaches with proof of correctness for SIRAP. An evaluation suggests that this new schedulability analysis can decrease the analytical subsystem utilization significantly.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Malardalen Real ... stera\u0308s, Sweden", "Malardalen Real ... stera\u0308s, Sweden"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Moris Behnam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Behnam:Moris", "Thomas Nolte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nolte:Thomas", "Reinder J.
