Unfortunately, the use of a typical finite domain (FD) solver based on local consistency-based filtering has strong limitations when constraints on indexes are combined with constraints on array elements and size. This paper proposes an efficient and complete FD-solving technique for extended constraints over (possibly unbounded) arrays. We describe a simple but particularly powerful transformation for building an equisatisfiable formula that can be efficiently solved using standard FD reasoning over arrays, even in the unbounded case. Experiments show that the proposed solver significantly outperforms FD solvers, and successfully competes with the best SMT-solvers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Rennes", "Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique et aux \u00e9nergies alternatives", "Simula Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Quentin Plazar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plazar:Quentin", "Mathieu Acher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acher:Mathieu", "S\u00e9bastien Bardin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardin:S=eacute=bastien", "Arnaud Gotlieb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gotlieb:Arnaud"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
