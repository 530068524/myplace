{"title": "A MRF shape prior for facade parsing with occlusions.", "fields": ["facade", "parsing", "grid", "expressive power", "rule based machine translation"], "abstract": "We present a new shape prior formalism for the segmentation of rectified facade images. It combines the simplicity of split grammars with unprecedented expressive power: the capability of encoding simultaneous alignment in two dimensions, facade occlusions and irregular boundaries between facade elements. We formulate the task of finding the most likely image segmentation conforming to a prior of the proposed form as a MAP-MRF problem over a 4-connected pixel grid, and propose an efficient optimization algorithm for solving it. Our method simultaneously segments the visible and occluding objects, and recovers the structure of the occluded facade. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on a number of facade segmentation datasets.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mateusz Kozinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozinski:Mateusz", "Raghudeep Gadde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gadde:Raghudeep", "Sergey Zagoruyko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zagoruyko:Sergey", "Guillaume Obozinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Obozinski:Guillaume", "Renaud Marlet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marlet:Renaud"], "pages": 9}
