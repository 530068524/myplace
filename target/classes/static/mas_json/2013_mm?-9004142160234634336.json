The paper at hand introduces Social Signal Interpretation (SSI), a framework for real-time recognition of social signals. SSI supports a large range of sensor devices, filter and feature algorithms, as well as, machine learning and pattern recognition tools. It encourages developers to add new components using SSI's C++ API, but also addresses front end users by offering an XML interface to build pipelines with a text editor.
