{"title": "Tutorial Authorship and Hybrid Designers: The Joy (and Frustration) of DIY Tutorials.", "fields": ["interaction design", "multimedia", "frustration", "vitality", "competence"], "abstract": "Tutorials are critical to the success and vitality of DIY practices. In this paper, we elevate the importance of tutorial authorship as one way to maintain and improve the quality of tutorials in DIY. We discuss the role interaction designers can play as hybrid designers, mediating between author and audience to contribute to the improvement of practices of tutorial authorship in DIY. We examine the quality of tutorials through the building and analysis of ten DIY projects and tutorials. We analyze key issues across three categories: 1) competences, components and tools, 2) sequencing, 3) and communication. We offer findings that are both practical guidelines for detailed improvements of tutorials and structural themes for improving tutorial authorship including the themes of accurate information, competences and tools, and tutorial format. In conclusion, we discuss the potential for interaction designers to simultaneously mediate and shape tutorials and tools in a form of hybrid design.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ron Wakkary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wakkary:Ron", "Markus Lorenz Schilling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schilling:Markus_Lorenz", "Matthew A.
