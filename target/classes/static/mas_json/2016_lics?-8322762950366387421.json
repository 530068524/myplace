Our trade-offs also apply to first-order counting logic, and by the known connection to the k-dimensional Weisfeiler--Leman algorithm imply near-optimal lower bounds on the number of refinement iterations. A key component in our proof is the hardness condensation technique recently introduced by [Razborov '16] in the context of proof complexity. We apply this method to reduce the domain size of relational structures while maintaining the quantifier depth required to distinguish them.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Humboldt University of Berlin", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Christoph Berkholz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berkholz:Christoph", "Jakob Nordstr\u00f6m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nordstr=ouml=m:Jakob"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
