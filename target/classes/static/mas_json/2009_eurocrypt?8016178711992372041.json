{"title": "Cryptanalysis on HMAC/NMAC-MD5 and MD5-MAC.", "fields": ["distinguishing attack", "cryptanalysis", "random function", "hash based message authentication code", "md5"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first distinguishing attack on HMAC and NMAC based on MD5 without related keys, which distinguishes the HMAC/NMAC-MD5 from HMAC/NMAC with a random function. The attack needs 297 queries, with a success probability 0.87, while the previous distinguishing attack on HMAC-MD5 reduced to 33 rounds takes 2126.1 messages with a success rate of 0.92. Furthermore, we give distinguishing and partial key recovery attacks on MD x  -MAC based on MD5. The MD x  -MAC was proposed by Preneel and van Oorschot in Crypto'95 which uses three subkeys derived from the initial key. We are able to recover one 128-bit subkey with 297 queries.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Shandong University", "Tsinghua University", "Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Shandong University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Xiaoyun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaoyun", "Hongbo Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Hongbo", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0035:Wei", "Haina Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haina", "Tao Zhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhan:Tao"], "pages": 13}
