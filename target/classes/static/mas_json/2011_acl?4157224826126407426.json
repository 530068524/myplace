Our approach makes use of large amounts of unlabeled data in a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework. We construct a large graph where vertices correspond to potential predicates and use label propagation to learn possible semantic frames for new ones. The label-propagated graph is used within a frame-semantic parser and, for unknown predicates, results in over 15% absolute improvement in frame identification accuracy and over 13% absolute improvement in full frame-semantic parsing F1 score on a blind test set, over a state-of-the-art supervised baseline.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Dipanjan Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das_0001:Dipanjan", "Noah A.
