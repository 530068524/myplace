{"title": "Living in a glass house: a survey of private moments in the home.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "human computer interaction", "multimedia", "computer science", "entertainment"], "abstract": "As advances in technology accelerate, sensors and recording devices are increasingly being integrated into homes. Although the added benefit of sensing is often clear (e.g., entertainment, security, encouraging sustainable behaviors, etc.), the home is a private and intimate place, with multiple stakeholders who may have competing priorities and tolerances for what is acceptable and useful. In an effort to develop systems that account for the needs and concerns of householders, we conducted an anonymous survey (N = 475) focusing on the activities and habits that people do at home that they would not want to be recorded. In this paper, we discuss those activities and where in the home they are performed, and offer suggestions for the design of UbiComp systems that rely on sensing and recording.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Intel", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "Lab126, Cupertino, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Eun Kyoung Choe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choe:Eun_Kyoung", "Sunny Consolvo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Consolvo:Sunny", "Jaeyeon Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Jaeyeon", "Beverly L.
