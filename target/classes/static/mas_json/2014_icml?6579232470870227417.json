The method achieves a linear convergence rate on functions that satisfy an essential strong convexity property and a sublinear rate (1/K) on general convex functions. Near-linear speedup on a multicore system can be expected if the number of processors is O(n1/2) in unconstrained optimization and O(n1/4) in the separable-constrained case, where n is the number of variables. We describe results from implementation on 40-core processors.", "citation": "Citations (137)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Stanford University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Stanford University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ji Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Ji", "Stephen J.
