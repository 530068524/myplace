To date, researchers have essentially taken a signal processing approach to GPS security and shown that GPS is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing.   In this work, we systematically map out a larger attack surface by viewing GPS as a computer system. Our surface includes higher level GPS protocol messages than previous work, as well as the GPS OS and downstream dependent systems. We develop a new hardware platform for GPS attacks, and develop novel attacks against GPS infrastructure. Our experiments on consumer and professional-grade receivers show that GPS and GPS-dependent systems are significantly more vulnerable than previously thought. For example, we show that remote attacks via malicious GPS broadcasts are capable of bringing down up to 30% and 20% of the global CORS navigation and NTRIP networks, respectively, using hardware that costs about the same as a laptop. In order to improve security, we propose systems-level defenses and principles that can be deployed to secure critical GPS and dependent systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Istituto Superiore Mario Boella", "Istituto Superiore Mario Boella", "Istituto Superiore Mario Boella", "Istituto Superiore Mario Boella", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "Virginia Tech", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "Coherent Naviga ...
