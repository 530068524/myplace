Despite being a quite influential body of work, little is known about how software process maturity models and improvement activities relate to a major trend in the software industry: geographic distribution of development activities. In this paper, we seek to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between software process maturity and geographic distribution. In particular, we studied their combined impact on software quality. Using data from a multi-national software development organization, our analyses revealed that process maturity and the multiple dimensions of distribution have a significant impact on the quality of software components. More importantly, our analyses showed that the benefits of increases in process maturity diminish as the development work becomes more distributed, a result that has major implications for future research work in the process and the global software engineering literature as well as important implications for practitioners.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["Bosch", "Bosch"], "authors": ["Marcelo Cataldo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cataldo:Marcelo", "Sangeeth Nambiar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nambiar:Sangeeth"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
