We implemented our algorithms in the EyeTap Digital Glass electric seeing aid, for use in everyday life. We also tested the algorithms in extreme dynamic range situations, such as, electric arc welding. Our system runs in real-time, and requires no user intervention, and no fine-tuning of parameters after a one-time calibration, even under a wide variety of very difficult lighting conditions (e.g. electric arc welding, including detailed inspection of the arc, weld puddle, and shielding gas in TIG welding). Our approach can render video at 1920x1080 pixel resolution at interactive frame rates that vary from 24 to 60 frames per second with GPU acceleration. We also implemented our system on FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) for being miniaturized and built into eyeglass frames.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Raymond Chun Hing Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo:Raymond_Chun_Hing", "Steve Mann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mann:Steve", "Jason Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jason", "Valmiki Rampersad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rampersad:Valmiki", "Tao Ai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ai:Tao"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
