{"title": "Understanding the impact of abstracted audio preview of SMS.", "fields": ["emoticon", "internet privacy", "information and communications technology", "mobile phone", "concatenated sms"], "abstract": "Despite the availability of other mobile messaging applications, SMS has kept its position as a heavily used communication technology. However, there are many situations in which it is inconvenient or inappropriate to check a message's content immediately. In this paper, we introduce the concept of audio previews of SMS. Based on a real-time analysis of the content of a message, we provide auditory cues in addition to the notification tone upon receiving an SMS. We report on a field trial with 20 participants and show that the use of audio-enhanced SMS affects the reading and writing behavior of users. Our work is motivated by the results of an online survey among 347 SMS users of whose we analyzed 3400 text messages.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Duisburg-Essen", "Nokia", "University of Duisburg-Essen", "University of Duisburg-Essen", "Nokia"], "authors": ["Alireza Sahami Shirazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shirazi:Alireza_Sahami", "Ari-Heikki Sarjanoja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarjanoja:Ari=Heikki", "Florian Alt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alt:Florian", "Albrecht Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt_0001:Albrecht", "Jonna H\u00e4kkil\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=kkil=auml=:Jonna"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
