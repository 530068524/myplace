{"title": "Hypertagging: Supertagging for Surface Realization with CCG.", "fields": ["part of speech", "syntax", "chart", "natural language processing", "parsing"], "abstract": "In lexicalized grammatical formalisms, it is possible to separate lexical category assignment from the combinatory processes that make use of such categories, such as parsing and realization. We adapt techniques from supertagging \u2014 a relatively recent technique that performs complex lexical tagging before full parsing (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999; Clark, 2002) \u2014 for chart realization in OpenCCG, an open-source NLP toolkit for CCG. We call this approach hypertagging, as it operates at a level \u201cabove\u201d the syntax, tagging semantic representations with syntactic lexical categories. Our results demonstrate that a hypertagger-informed chart realizer can achieve substantial improvements in realization speed (being approximately twice as fast) with superior realization quality.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Dominic Espinosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Espinosa:Dominic", "Michael White.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/White_0001:Michael", "Dennis Mehay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehay:Dennis"], "pages": 9}
