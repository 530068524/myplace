Telecare services such as remote monitoring systems are now coming onto the consumer market but there is little knowledge of the impact these technologies may have on relationships between family members and older relatives. We present findings from a live field trial of SHel--a telecare system that allows nominated caregivers to remotely monitor activities--in 17 older adult's homes. Interviews were conducted with the 17 older participants and 11 of their nominated caregivers before, during and after using the system. We establish that such technologies transform existing hidden care routines between family members into care work, and the impact they have upon the sense of independence and privacy of those who are being monitored in their home.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Swansea University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "authors": ["John Vines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vines:John", "Stephen Lindsay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindsay:Stephen", "Gary W.
