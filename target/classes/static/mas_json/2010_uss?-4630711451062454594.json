{"title": "AdJail: Practical Enforcement of Confidentiality and Integrity Policies on Web Advertisements.", "fields": ["overhead", "end user", "confidentiality", "user experience design", "enforcement"], "abstract": "Web publishers frequently integrate third-party advertisements into web pages that also contain sensitive publisher data and end-user personal data. This practice exposes sensitive page content to confidentiality and integrity attacks launched by advertisements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for addressing security threats posed by third-party advertisements. The heart of our framework is an innovative isolation mechanism that enables publishers to transparently interpose between advertisements and end users. The mechanism supports finegrained policy specification and enforcement, and does not affect the user experience of interactive ads. Evaluation of our framework suggests compatibility with several mainstream ad networks, security from many threats from advertisements and acceptable performance overheads.", "citation": "Citations (137)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Mike Ter Louw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Louw:Mike_Ter", "Karthik Thotta Ganesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganesh:Karthik_Thotta", "V.
