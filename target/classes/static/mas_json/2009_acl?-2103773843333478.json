However, MBR targeting BLEU is prohibitively slow to optimize over k-best lists for large k. In this paper, we introduce and analyze an alternative to MBR that is equally effective at improving performance, yet is asymptotically faster --- running 80 times faster than MBR in experiments with 1000-best lists. Furthermore, our fast decoding procedure can select output sentences based on distributions over entire forests of translations, in addition to k-best lists. We evaluate our procedure on translation forests from two large-scale, state-of-the-art hierarchical machine translation systems. Our forest-based decoding objective consistently outperforms k-best list MBR, giving improvements of up to 1.0 BLEU.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Yang", "Haitao Mi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mi:Haitao", "Yang Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Yang", "Qun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qun"], "pages": 9}
