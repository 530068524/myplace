We leverage knowledge of the problem\u2019s geometry to form a cost volume using deep feature representations. We learn to incorporate contextual information using 3-D convolutions over this volume. Disparity values are regressed from the cost volume using a proposed differentiable soft argmin operation, which allows us to train our method end-to-end to sub-pixel accuracy without any additional post-processing or regularization. We evaluate our method on the Scene Flow and KITTI datasets and on KITTI we set a new stateof-the-art benchmark, while being significantly faster than competing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Washington", "University of Cambridge", "University of Washington", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Alex Kendall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kendall:Alex", "Hayk Martirosyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martirosyan:Hayk", "Saumitro Dasgupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasgupta:Saumitro", "Peter Henry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henry:Peter"], "pages": 10}
