{"title": "Robust PCA in High-dimension: A Deterministic Approach.", "fields": ["deterministic system", "machine learning", "robustness", "curse of dimensionality", "principal component analysis"], "abstract": "We consider principal component analysis for contaminated data-set in the high dimensional regime, where the dimensionality of each observation is comparable or even more than the number of observations. We propose a deterministic high-dimensional robust PCA algorithm which inherits all theoretical properties of its randomized counterpart, i.e., it is tractable, robust to contaminated points, easily kernelizable, asymptotic consistent and achieves maximal robustness - a breakdown point of 50%. More importantly, the proposed method exhibits significantly better computational efficiency, which makes it suitable for large-scale real applications.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Jiashi Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jiashi", "Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
