{"title": "Optimal Control of Distributed Computing Networks with Mixed-Cast Traffic Flows.", "fields": ["unicast", "network packet", "multicast", "optimal control", "computation"], "abstract": "Distributed computing networks, tasked with both packet transmission and processing, require the joint optimization of communication and computation resources. We develop a dynamic control policy that determines both routes and processing locations for packets upon their arrival at a distributed computing network. The proposed policy, referred to as Universal Computing Network Control (UCNC), guarantees that packets i) are processed by a specified chain of service functions, ii) follow cycle-free routes between consecutive functions, and iii) are delivered to their corresponding set of destinations via proper packet duplications. UCNC is shown to be throughput-optimal for any mix of unicast and multicast traffic, and is the first throughput-optimal policy for non-unicast traffic in distributed computing networks with both communication and computation constraints. Moreover, simulation results suggest that UCNC yields substantially lower average packet delay compared with existing control policies for unicast traffic.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jianan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jianan", "Abhishek Sinha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinha:Abhishek", "Jaime Llorca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Llorca:Jaime", "Antonia Maria Tulino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tulino:Antonia_Maria", "Eytan Modiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Modiano:Eytan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
