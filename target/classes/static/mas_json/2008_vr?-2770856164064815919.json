However, the incorporation of haptics into such simulations has been increasing in years. Similarly, the use of medical simulation has also been increasing. We present an inexpensive, portable system for training hemorrhage control. While our focus has been on combat medics, the system, known as the extremities-multiple application training (or E-MAT), can apply across all medical fields and support multiple procedures. E-MAT can operate in a stand-alone mode or integrated with a host PC or PDA application.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "CHI Systems, In ... @chisystems.com", "CHI Systems, In ... @chisystems.com", "Organizational  ... iddle@osd-i.com"], "authors": ["Todd Lazarus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazarus:Todd", "Glenn A.
