The method simultaneously (i) learns to reconstruct a dense 3D occupancy map from sparse depth measurements, and (ii) optimizes the reactive control of depth-measuring rays. To make the first step towards the online control optimization, we propose a fast prioritized greedy algorithm, which needs to update its cost function in only a small fraction of possible rays. The approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm is derived. An experimental evaluation on the subset of the KITTI dataset demonstrates significant improvement in the 3D map accuracy when learning-to-reconstruct from sparse measurements is coupled with the optimization of depth measuring rays.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Karel Zimmermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmermann:Karel", "Tomas Petricek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petricek_0002:Tomas", "Vojtech Salansky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salansky:Vojtech", "Tom\u00e1s Svoboda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svoboda:Tom=aacute=s"], "pages": 9}
