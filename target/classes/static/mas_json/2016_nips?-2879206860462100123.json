To address this shortcoming, over a decade ago, Burer and Monteiro proposed to solve SDP's with few equality constraints via rank-restricted, non-convex surrogates. Remarkably, for some applications, local optimization methods seem to converge to global optima of these non-convex surrogates reliably. Although some theory supports this empirical success, a complete explanation of it remains an open question. In this paper, we consider a class of SDP's which includes applications such as max-cut, community detection in the stochastic block model, robust PCA, phase retrieval and synchronization of rotations. We show that the low-rank Burer-Monteiro formulation of SDP's in that class almost never has any spurious local optima.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Nicolas Boumal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boumal:Nicolas", "Vladislav Voroninski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voroninski:Vladislav", "Afonso S.
