A radiometric model that explains, under some mild simplifications, the working principle of a ToF camera including a model for MpI is proposed. Using this model we demonstrate that all the information needed for compensating the influence of MpI on the scene captured by the camera is self-contained in the measurements (depth and amplitude of infrared signal). We propose an iterative optimization method that, based on the measurements contaminated with MpI, gives depth correction for each pixel. Results are shown in artificially generated time of flight scenes using the radiometric model. In addition, the system has been validated in real scenes using a commercial ToF camera providing good results.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Alcal\u00e1", "University of Alcal\u00e1", "University of Alcal\u00e1", "University of Alcal\u00e1"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["David Jim\u00e9nez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jim=eacute=nez:David", "Daniel Pizarro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pizarro:Daniel", "Manuel Mazo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazo:Manuel", "Sira E.
