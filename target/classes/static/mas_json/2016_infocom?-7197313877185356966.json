{"title": "ARS: Cross-layer adaptive request scheduling to mitigate TCP incast in data center networks.", "fields": ["h tcp", "cubic tcp", "compound tcp", "tcp westwood plus", "zeta tcp"], "abstract": "In data center networks, many network-intensive applications typically suffer TCP incast throughput collapse when bursty concurrent TCP flows share a single bottleneck link. To address the TCP incast problem, we first reveal theoretically and empirically that controlling the number of concurrent flows is much more effective in reducing the incast probability than controlling the congestion window. We further propose a novel cross-layer design called Adaptive Request Schedule (ARS), which dynamically adjusts the number of concurrent TCP flows by batching application requests according to the congestion state acquired from transport layer. ARS is deployed only at the aggregator-side, while making no modification on hundreds or thousands of workers. Broad applicability is another advantage of ARS. We integrated ARS transparently (i.e., without modification) with DCTCP and TCP NewReno on NS2 simulation and a physical testbed, respectively. The experimental results show that ARS significantly reduces the incast probability across different TCP protocols and that the network goodput can be increased consistently by on average 6x under severe congestion.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Central South University", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Jiawei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jiawei", "Tian He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Tian", "Yi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Yi", "Jianxin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jianxin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
