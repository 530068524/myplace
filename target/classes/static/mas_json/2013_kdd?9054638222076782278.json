{"title": "FIU-Miner: a fast, integrated, and user-friendly system for data mining in distributed environment.", "fields": ["distributed computing environment", "user friendly", "complex data type", "big data", "workflow"], "abstract": "The advent of Big Data era drives data analysts from different domains to use data mining techniques for data analysis. However, performing data analysis in a specific domain is not trivial; it often requires complex task configuration, onerous integration of algorithms, and efficient execution in distributed environments.Few efforts have been paid on developing effective tools to facilitate data analysts in conducting complex data analysis tasks.   In this paper, we design and implement FIU-Miner, a Fast, Integrated, and User-friendly system to ease data analysis. FIU-Miner allows users to  rapidly configure a complex data analysis task  without writing a single line of code. It also helps users  conveniently import and integrate different analysis programs . Further, it significantly  balances resource utilization and task execution in heterogeneous environments . A case study of a real-world application demonstrates the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed system.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Florida International University", "Florida International University"], "authors": ["Chunqiu Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Chunqiu", "Yexi Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yexi", "Li Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0001:Li", "Jingxuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jingxuan", "Lei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Lei", "Hongtai Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongtai", "Chao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chao", "Wubai Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Wubai", "Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Tao", "Bing Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Bing", "Ming Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Ming", "Pengnian Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Pengnian"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
