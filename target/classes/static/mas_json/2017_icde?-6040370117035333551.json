{"title": "Similarity Search in Graph Databases: A Multi-Layered Indexing Approach.", "fields": ["graph bandwidth", "simplex graph", "complement graph", "null graph", "factor critical graph"], "abstract": "We consider in this paper the similarity search problem that retrieves relevant graphs from a graph database under the well-known graph edit distance (GED) constraint. Formally, given a graph database G = fg1, g2, \u2026, gng and a query graph q, we aim to search the graph gi 2 G such that the graph edit distance between gi and q, GED(gi, q), is within a userspecified GED threshold. In spite of its theoretical significance and wide applicability, the GED-based similarity search problem is challenging in large graph databases due in particular to a large amount of GED computation incurred, which has proven to be NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a parameterized, partitionbased GED lower bound that can be instantiated into a series of tight lower bounds towards synergistically pruning false-positive graphs from G before costly GED computation is performed. We design an efficient, selectivity-aware algorithm to partition graphs of G into highly selective subgraphs. They are further incorporated in a cost-effective, multi-layered indexing structure, MLIndex (Multi-Layered Index), for GED lower bound crosschecking and false-positive graph filtering with theoretical performance guarantees. Experimental studies in real and synthetic graph databases validate the efficiency and effectiveness of ML-Index, which achieves up to an order of magnitude speedup over the state-of-the-art method for similarity search in graph databases.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Florida State University"], "authors": ["Yongjiang Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Yongjiang", "Peixiang Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Peixiang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
