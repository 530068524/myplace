Rapid growth of internet and mobile device usage has given rise to multiple customer touchpoints. This coupled with factors like high cookie churn rate results in a fragmented view of user activity at the advertiser\u2019s end. Current literature assumes procured user signals as the absolute truth which is contested by absence of deterministic identity linkage across a user\u2019s multiple avatars. This is the first work advocating the application of Robust Optimization (RO) principles to design approaches that account for these data uncertainties and are immune against perturbations. We propose two novel algorithms: robust factorization machine (RFM) and its field aware variant (RFFM), under interval uncertainty. These formulations are generic and can find applicability in any classification setting under noise. We provide a distributed and scalable Spark implementation using parallel stochastic gradient descent. In the experiments conducted on three real world datasets, the robust counterparts outperform the baselines significantly under perturbed settings. Our experimental findings reveal interesting connections between choice of uncertainty set and the noise-proofness of resulting models.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Walmart Labs", "Walmart Labs"], "authors": ["Surabhi Punjabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Punjabi:Surabhi", "Priyanka Bhatt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhatt:Priyanka"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
