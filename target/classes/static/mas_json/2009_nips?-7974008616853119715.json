This approach involves the calculation of the first four moments of the permutation distribution. We propose a novel recursive method to derive these moments theoretically and analytically without any permutation. Experimental results using different test statistics are demonstrated using simulated data and real data. The proposed strategy takes advantage of nonparametric permutation tests and parametric Pearson distribution approximation to achieve both accuracy and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "North Carolina State University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Chunxiao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Chunxiao", "Huixia Judy Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huixia_Judy", "Yongmei Michelle Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yongmei_Michelle"], "pages": 9}
