In using this distance as a statistic for a test of whether two samples are from different distributions, a major difficulty arises in computing the significance threshold, since the empirical statistic has as its null distribution (where P = Q) an infinite weighted sum of \u03c72 random variables. Prior finite sample approximations to the null distribution include using bootstrap resampling, which yields a consistent estimate but is computationally costly; and fitting a parametric model with the low order moments of the test statistic, which can work well in practice but has no consistency or accuracy guarantees. The main result of the present work is a novel estimate of the null distribution, computed from the eigen-spectrum of the Gram matrix on the aggregate sample from P and Q, and having lower computational cost than the bootstrap. A proof of consistency of this estimate is provided. The performance of the null distribution estimate is compared with the bootstrap and parametric approaches on an artificial example, high dimensional multivariate data, and text.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, San Diego", "Inst. of Statis ... , Tokyo, Japan"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Arthur Gretton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gretton:Arthur", "Kenji Fukumizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukumizu:Kenji", "Za\u00efd Harchaoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harchaoui:Za=iuml=d", "Bharath K.
