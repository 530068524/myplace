{"title": "Evasion and Hardening of Tree Ensemble Classifiers.", "fields": ["integer", "boosting", "random forest", "decision tree model", "solver"], "abstract": "Classifier evasion consists in finding for a given instance x the \"nearest\" instance x\u2032 such that the classifier predictions of x and x\u2032 are different. We present two novel algorithms for systematically computing evasions for tree ensembles such as boosted trees and random forests. Our first algorithm uses a Mixed Integer Linear Program solver and finds the optimal evading instance under an expressive set of constraints. Our second algorithm trades off optimality for speed by using symbolic prediction, a novel algorithm for fast finite differences on tree ensembles. On a digit recognition task, we demonstrate that both gradient boosted trees and random forests are extremely susceptible to evasions. Finally, we harden a boosted tree model without loss of predictive accuracy by augmenting the training set of each boosting round with evading instances, a technique we call adversarial boosting.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Alex Kantchelian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kantchelian:Alex", "J.
