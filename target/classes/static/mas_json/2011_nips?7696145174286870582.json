{"title": "Expressive Power and Approximation Errors of Restricted Boltzmann Machines.", "fields": ["boltzmann machine", "probability distribution", "divergence", "expressive power", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We present explicit classes of probability distributions that can be learned by Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) depending on the number of units that they contain, and which are representative for the expressive power of the model. We use this to show that the maximal Kullback-Leibler divergence to the RBM model with n visible and m hidden units is bounded from above by (n \u2013 1) \u2013 log(m + 1). In this way we can specify the number of hidden units that guarantees a sufficiently rich model containing different classes of distributions and respecting a given error tolerance.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Guido Mont\u00fafar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mont=uacute=far:Guido", "Johannes Rauh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rauh:Johannes", "Nihat Ay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ay:Nihat"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
