Personalized differential privacy.", "fields": ["direct method", "differential privacy", "aggregate data", "privacy by design", "privacy software"], "abstract": "Differential privacy is widely accepted as a powerful framework for providing strong, formal privacy guarantees for aggregate data analysis. A limitation of the model is that the same level of privacy protection is afforded for all individuals. However, it is common that the data subjects have quite different expectations regarding the acceptable level of privacy for their data. Consequently, differential privacy may lead to insufficient privacy protection for some users, while over-protecting others. We argue that by accepting that not all users require the same level of privacy, a higher level of utility can often be attained by not providing excess privacy to those who do not want it. We propose a new privacy definition called personalized differential privacy (PDP), a generalization of differential privacy in which users specify a personal privacy requirement for their data. We then introduce several novel mechanisms for achieving PDP. Our primary mechanism is a general one that automatically converts any existing differentially private algorithm into one that satisfies PDP. We also present a more direct approach for achieving PDP, inspired by the well-known exponential mechanism. We demonstrate our framework through extensive experiments on real and synthetic data.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "University of Warwick"], "authors": ["Zach Jorgensen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jorgensen:Zach", "Ting Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Ting", "Graham Cormode.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cormode:Graham"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
