We introduce a new randomized nondeterministic four-party communication model that enables \"accelerated\", error-preserving simulations of dynamic data structures. We use this technique to prove an \u03a9(n(log n/log log n)2) cell-probe lower bound for the dynamic 2D weighted orthogonal range counting problem (2D-ORC) with n/poly log n updates and n queries, that holds even for data structures with exp(-\u03a9(n)) success probability. This result not only proves the highest amortized lower bound to date, but is also tight in the strongest possible sense, as a matching upper bound can be obtained by a deterministic data structure with worst-case operational time. This is the first demonstration of a \"sharp threshold\" phenomenon for dynamic data structures. Our broader motivation is that cell-probe lower bounds for exponentially small success facilitate reductions from dynamic to static data structures. As a proof-of-concept, we show that a slightly strengthened version of our lower bound would imply an \u03a9((log n/log log n)2) lower bound for the static 3D-ORC problem with O(n logO(1) n) space. Such result would give a near quadratic improvement over the highest known static cell-probe lower bound, and break the long standing \u03a9(log n) barrier for static data structures.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["New York University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Omri Weinstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weinstein:Omri", "Huacheng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Huacheng"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
