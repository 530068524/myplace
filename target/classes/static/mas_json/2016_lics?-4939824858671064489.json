We also give an effective necessary condition, in terms of the syntactic monoid of a regular language, for a property to be expressible in this logic. We show that this condition is also sufficient for words over a two-letter alphabet. This algebraic analysis allows us us to prove, among other things, that our new logic has strictly less expressive power than full first-order logic FO[", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of T\u00fcbingen", "Tata Institute of Fundamental Research", "Boston College", "The Institute o ... atical Sciences"], "authors": ["Andreas Krebs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krebs:Andreas", "Kamal Lodaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lodaya:Kamal", "Paritosh K.
