Based on a Grounded Theory study involving 40 participants at 16 organizations, and corroborated by 4 independent case studies, we argue that development methods and practices must be adapted to fit their contexts. Understanding Agility in context will help development teams, their managers, and Agile coaches to adapt development processes to fit their projects' contexts.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Victoria University of Wellington", "University of British Columbia", "Victoria University of Wellington", "Victoria University of Wellington", "London, UK"], "authors": ["Rashina Hoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoda:Rashina", "Philippe Kruchten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kruchten:Philippe", "James Noble.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noble_0001:James", "Stuart Marshall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marshall:Stuart"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2010", "pages": 15}
