In particular, our approach accepts more type-correct programs than previous approaches when they do not employ type annotations. A side benefit of our approach is that it can detect a wide range of runtime errors that are missed by previous approaches. Our method is based on the idea to represent type refinements in pattern-matching branches by choice types, which facilitate a separation of the typing and reconciliation phases and thus support case expressions. This idea is formalized in a type system, which is both sound and a conservative extension of the classical Hindley-Milner system. We present the results of an empirical evaluation that compares our algorithm with previous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Sheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0008:Sheng", "Martin Erwig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erwig:Martin"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
