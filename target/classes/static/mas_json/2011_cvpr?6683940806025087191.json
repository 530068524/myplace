We explore the use of multicore CPU as well as multicore GPUs for this purpose. We show that overcoming the severe memory and bandwidth limitations of current generation GPUs not only leads to more space efficient algorithms, but also to surprising savings in runtime. Our CPU based system is up to ten times and our GPU based system is up to thirty times faster than the current state of the art methods [1], while maintaining comparable convergence behavior.
