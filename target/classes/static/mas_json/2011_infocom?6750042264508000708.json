{"title": "CABET: Connectivity-based boundary extraction of large-scale 3D sensor networks.", "fields": ["computer vision", "feature extraction", "edge detection", "skeleton", "wireless sensor network"], "abstract": "Sensor networks are invariably coupled tightly with the geometric environment in which the sensor nodes are deployed. Network boundary is one of the key features that characterize such environments. While significant advances have been made for 2D cases, so far boundary extraction for 3D sensor networks has not been thoroughly studied. We present CABET, a novel Connectivity-bAsed Boundary Extraction scheme for large-scale Three-dimensional sensor networks. To the best of our knowledge, CABET is the first 3Dcapable and pure connectivity-based solution for detecting sensor network boundaries. It is fully distributed. A highlight of CABET is its non-uniform critical node sampling, called r r\u2032-sampling, that selects landmarks to form boundary surfaces with bias toward nodes embodying salient topological features. Simulations show that CABET is able to extract a well-connected boundary in the presence of holes and shape variation, with performance superior to that of some state-of-the-art alternatives. In addition, we show how CABET benefits a range of sensor network applications including 3D skeleton extraction and 3D segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Hongbo Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Hongbo", "Shengkai Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shengkai", "Guang Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Guang", "Chonggang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chonggang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
