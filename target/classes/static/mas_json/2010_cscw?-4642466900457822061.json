Focusing on the use of Twitter, a microblogging service, we identified mechanisms of information production, distribution, and organization. The Red River event resulted in a rapid generation of Twitter communications by numerous sources using a variety of communications forms, including autobiographical and mainstream media reporting, among other types. We examine the social life of microblogged information, identifying generative, synthetic, derivative and innovative properties that sustain the broader system of interaction. The landscape of Twitter is such that the production of new information is supported through derivative activities of directing, relaying, synthesizing, and redistributing, and is additionally complemented by socio-technical innovation. These activities comprise self-organization of information.", "citation": "Citations (458)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "authors": ["Kate Starbird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Starbird:Kate", "Leysia Palen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palen:Leysia", "Amanda Lee Hughes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hughes:Amanda_Lee", "Sarah Vieweg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vieweg:Sarah"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
