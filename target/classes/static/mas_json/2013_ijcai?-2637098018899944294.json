Such qualitative information can be formulated as a Qualitative Constraint Network (QCN). In this paper, we focus on the minimal labeling problem (MLP) and we propose an algorithm to efficiently derive all the feasible base relations of a QCN. Our algorithm considers chordal QCNs and a new form of partial consistency which we define as G\u2666-consistency. Further, the proposed algorithm uses tractable subclasses of relations having a specific patchwork property for which \u22c4-consistency implies the consistency of the input QCN. Experimentations with QCNs of IA and RCC-8 show the importance and efficiency of this new approach.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Arab Open University", "university of lille", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Nouhad Amaneddine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amaneddine:Nouhad", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Condotta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Condotta:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois", "Michael Sioutis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sioutis:Michael"], "pages": 7}
