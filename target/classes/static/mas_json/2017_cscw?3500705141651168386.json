Peer assessment is found to be an effective learning tool for programming education. While many systems are proposed to support peer assessment in programming education, little effort has been devoted to finding ways to improve the peer assessment by assisting the students to understand the programs they are assessing. We introduce Eliph, a web-based peer assessment system for programming education with code history visualization. Eliph incorporates the visualization of character-level code history, selection-based history tracking and the integration of execution events to assist students in understanding programs written by peers, thereby leading to more effective peer assessment. We evaluate Eliph with an experiment in an undergraduate CS course. We show that visualization of code history has positive effects on promoting higher quality of peer feedback by understanding the intention and thought process.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "cscw", "authors": ["Jungkook Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jungkook", "Yeong Hoon Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Yeong_Hoon", "Suin Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Suin", "Alice H.
