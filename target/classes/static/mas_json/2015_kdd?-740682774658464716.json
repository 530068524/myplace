The inference of brain networks has recently attracted much interest due to the increasing availability of high-resolution brain imaging data. Sparse inverse covariance estimation with lasso and group lasso penalty has been demonstrated to be a powerful approach to discover brain networks. Motivated by the hierarchical structure of the brain networks, we consider the problem of estimating a graphical model with tree-structural regularization in this paper. The regularization encourages the graphical model to exhibit a brain-like structure. Specifically, in this hierarchical structure, hundreds of thousands of voxels serve as the leaf nodes of the tree. A node in the intermediate layer represents a region formed by voxels in the subtree rooted at that node. The whole brain is considered as the root of the tree. We propose to apply the tree-structural regularized graphical model to estimate the mouse brain network. However, the dimensionality of whole-brain data, usually on the order of hundreds of thousands, poses significant computational challenges. Efficient algorithms that are capable of estimating networks from high-dimensional data are highly desired. To address the computational challenge, we develop a screening rule which can quickly identify many zero blocks in the estimated graphical model, thereby dramatically reducing the computational cost of solving the proposed model. It is based on a novel insight on the relationship between screening and the so-called proximal operator that we first establish in this paper. We perform experiments on both synthetic data and real data from the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas; results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Alibaba Group", "Arizona State University", "Old Dominion University", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Sen Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Sen", "Qian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Qian", "Shuiwang Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Shuiwang", "Peter Wonka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wonka:Peter", "Ian Davidson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davidson:Ian", "Jieping Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Jieping"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
