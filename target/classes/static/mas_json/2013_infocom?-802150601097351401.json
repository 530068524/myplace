{"title": "How much can large-scale Video-on-Demand benefit from users' cooperation?", "fields": ["stochastic modelling", "popularity", "server", "scaling", "bandwidth", "random variable"], "abstract": "We propose an analytical framework to tightly characterize the scaling laws for the additional bandwidth that servers must supply to guarantee perfect service in peer-assisted Video-on-Demand systems, taking into account essential aspects such as peer churn, bandwidth heterogeneity, and Zipf-like video popularity. Our results reveal that the catalog size and the content popularity distribution have a huge effect on the system performance. We show that users' cooperation can effectively reduce the servers' burden for a wide range of system parameters, confirming to be an attractive solution to limit the costs incurred by content providers as the system scales to large populations of users.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Institut Eur\u00e9com", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "Dipt. di Elettr ... o, Turin, Italy", "Dipt. di Inf.,  ... o, Turin, Italy", "Dipt. di Elettr ... o, Turin, Italy"], "authors": ["Delia Ciullo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciullo:Delia", "Valentina Martina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martina:Valentina", "Michele Garetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garetto:Michele", "Emilio Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Emilio"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
