{"title": "Iris: Monoids and Invariants as an Orthogonal Basis for Concurrent Reasoning.", "fields": ["monoid", "atomicity", "higher order logic", "premise", "orthogonal basis"], "abstract": "We present Iris, a concurrent separation logic with a simple premise: monoids and invariants are all you need. Partial commutative monoids enable us to express---and invariants enable us to enforce---user-defined *protocols* on shared state, which are at the conceptual core of most recent program logics for concurrency. Furthermore, through a novel extension of the concept of a *view shift*, Iris supports the encoding of *logically atomic specifications*, i.e., Hoare-style specs that permit the client of an operation to treat the operation essentially as if it were atomic, even if it is not.", "citation": "Citations (130)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "MPI-SWS, Saarbruecken, Germany", "Mozilla Researc ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Ralf Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung_0002:Ralf", "David Swasey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swasey:David", "Filip Sieczkowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sieczkowski:Filip", "Kasper Svendsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svendsen:Kasper", "Aaron Turon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turon:Aaron", "Lars Birkedal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Birkedal:Lars", "Derek Dreyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dreyer:Derek"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2015", "pages": 14}
