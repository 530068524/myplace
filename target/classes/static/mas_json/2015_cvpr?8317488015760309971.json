{"title": "BOLD - Binary online learned descriptor for efficient image matching.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "hamming distance", "uncorrelated", "embedding", "binary number"], "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel approach to generate a binary descriptor optimized for each image patch independently. The approach is inspired by the linear discriminant embedding that simultaneously increases inter and decreases intra class distances. A set of discriminative and uncorrelated binary tests is established from all possible tests in an offline training process. The patch adapted descriptors are then efficiently built online from a subset of tests which lead to lower intra class distances thus a more robust descriptor. A patch descriptor consists of two binary strings where one represents the results of the tests and the other indicates the subset of the patch-related robust tests that are used for calculating a masked Hamming distance. Our experiments on three different benchmarks demonstrate improvements in matching performance, and illustrate that per-patch optimization outperforms global optimization.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "University of Surrey", "University of Surrey"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Vassileios Balntas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balntas:Vassileios", "Lilian Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Lilian", "Krystian Mikolajczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mikolajczyk:Krystian"], "pages": 9}
