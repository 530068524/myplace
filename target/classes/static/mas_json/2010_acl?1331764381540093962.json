Instead, separate resources are created to address such problems. In this paper we show how to improve the quality of a treebank, by integrating resources and implementing improved analyses for specific constructions.\n\nWe demonstrate this rebanking process by creating an updated version of CCG-bank that includes the predicate-argument structure of both verbs and nouns, base-NP brackets, verb-particle constructions, and restrictive and non-restrictive nominal modifiers; and evaluate the impact of these changes on a statistical parser.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "University of Groningen"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Matthew Honnibal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Honnibal:Matthew", "James R.
