{"title": "An Infinite Hidden Markov Model With Similarity-Biased Transitions.", "fields": ["variable order markov model", "hidden semi markov model", "markov kernel", "markov chain mixing time", "markov model"], "abstract": "We describe a generalization of the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) which is able to encode prior information that state transitions are more likely between \"nearby\" states. This is accomplished by defining a similarity function on the state space and scaling transition probabilities by pair-wise similarities, thereby inducing correlations among the transition distributions. We present an augmented data representation of the model as a Markov Jump Process in which: (1) some jump attempts fail, and (2) the probability of success is proportional to the similarity between the source and destination states. This augmentation restores conditional conjugacy and admits a simple Gibbs sampler. We evaluate the model and inference method on a speaker diarization task and a \"harmonic parsing\" task using four-part chorale data, as well as on several synthetic datasets, achieving favorable comparisons to existing models.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oberlin College", "Oberlin College", "Sciences Techno ...
