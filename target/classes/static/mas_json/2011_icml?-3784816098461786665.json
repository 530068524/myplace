The goal is to jointly minimize the cost of both learning and covering. We extend recent work in this setting to allow for a limited amount of adversarial noise. Certain noisy query learning problems are a special case of our problem. Crucial to our analysis is a lemma showing the logical OR of two submodular cover constraints can be reduced to a single submodular set cover constraint. Combined with known results, this new lemma allows for arbitrary monotone circuits of submodular cover constraints to be reduced to a single constraint. As an example practical application, we present a movie recommendation website that minimizes the total cost of learning what the user wants to watch and recommending a set of movies.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Andrew Guillory.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guillory:Andrew", "Jeff A.
