{"title": "Social networking site use by mothers of young children.", "fields": ["applied psychology", "social media", "sociotechnical system", "social network", "usability"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first formal study of how mothers of young children (aged three and under) use social networking sites, particularly Facebook and Twitter, including mothers' perceptions of which SNSes are appropriate for sharing information about their children, changes in post style and frequency after birth, and the volume and nature of child-related content shared in these venues. Our findings have implications for improving the utility and usability of SNS tools for mothers of young children, as well as for creating and improving sociotechnical systems related to maternal and child health.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "departments": ["Microsoft"], "authors": ["Meredith Ringel Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Meredith_Ringel"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
