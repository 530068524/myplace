We use this template to construct pseudorandom generators for combinatorial rectangles and read-once CNFs and a hitting set generator for width-3 branching programs, all of which achieve near-optimal seed-length even in the low-error regime: We get seed-length $\\tilde{O}(\\log (n/\\epsilon))$ for error $\\epsilon$. Previously, only constructions with seed-length $O(\\log^{3/2} n)$ or $O(\\log^2 n)$ were known for these classes with error $\\epsilon = 1/\\poly(n)$. The (pseudo)random restrictions we use are milder than those typically used for proving circuit lower bounds in that we only set a constant fraction of the bits at a time. While such restrictions do not simplify the functions drastically, we show that they can be derandomized using small-bias spaces.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Parikshit Gopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalan:Parikshit", "Raghu Meka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meka:Raghu", "Omer Reingold.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reingold:Omer", "Luca Trevisan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trevisan:Luca", "Salil P.
