The first signal, respiratory rate, is estimated by measuring the visual expansion and contraction of the user's chest cavity during inhalation and exhalation. Additionally, we detect a specific type of fidgeting behavior, known as \u201cleg jiggling,\u201d by measuring high-frequency vertical oscillations of the user's knees. Both of these techniques rely on the combination of skeletal tracking information with raw depth readings from the sensor to identify the cyclical patterns in jittery, low-resolution data. Such subtle nonverbal signals may be useful for informing models of users' psychological states during communication with virtual human agents, thereby improving interactions that address important societal challenges in domains including education, training, and medicine.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Nathan Burba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burba:Nathan", "Mark T.
