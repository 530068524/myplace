{"title": "Adding Semantics to Data-Driven Paraphrasing.", "fields": ["logical consequence", "nobody", "paraphrase", "wordnet", "data driven"], "abstract": "We add an interpretable semantics to the paraphrase database (PPDB). To date, the relationship between phrase pairs in the database has been weakly defined as approximately equivalent. We show that these pairs represent a variety of relations, including directed entailment (little girl/girl) and exclusion (nobody/someone). We automatically assign semantic entailment relations to entries in PPDB using features derived from past work on discovering inference rules from text and semantic taxonomy induction. We demonstrate that our model assigns these relations with high accuracy. In a downstream RTE task, our labels rival relations from WordNet and improve the coverage of a proof-based RTE system by 17%.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Groningen", "University of Groningen", "Johns Hopkins University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ellie Pavlick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pavlick:Ellie", "Johan Bos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bos:Johan", "Malvina Nissim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nissim:Malvina", "Charley Beller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beller:Charley", "Benjamin Van Durme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durme:Benjamin_Van", "Chris Callison-Burch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Callison=Burch:Chris"], "pages": 11}
