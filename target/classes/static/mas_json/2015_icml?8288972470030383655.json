When confronted with data-intensive applications, however, the algorithm may be too expensive to implement, leaving us to consider the utility of approximations such as data subsampling. In this paper I demonstrate how data subsampling fundamentally compromises the scalability of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Warwick"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Michael Betancourt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Betancourt:Michael"], "pages": 8}
