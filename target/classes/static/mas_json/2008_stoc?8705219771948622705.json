{"title": "On the constant-depth complexity of k-clique.", "fields": ["almost surely", "vertex", "circuit complexity", "finite model theory", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We prove a lower bound of \u03c9(n k/4 ) on the size of constant-depth circuits solving the k-clique problem on n-vertex graphs (for every constant k). This improves a lower bound of \u03c9(n k/89d 2  ) due to Beame where d is the circuit depth. Our lower bound has the advantage that it does not depend on the constant d in the exponent of n, thus breaking the mold of the traditional size-depth tradeoff.   Our k-clique lower bound derives from a stronger result of independent interest. Suppose f n  :0,1 n/2  \u2192 {0,1} is a sequence of functions computed by constant-depth circuits of size O(n t ). Let G be an Erdos-Renyi random graph with vertex set {1,...,n} and independent edge probabilities n -\u03b1  where \u03b1 \u2264 1/2t-1. Let A be a uniform random k-element subset of {1,...,n} (where k is any constant independent of n) and let K A  denote the clique supported on A. We prove that f n (G) = f n (G \u222a K A ) asymptotically almost surely.   These results resolve a long-standing open question in finite model theory (going back at least to Immerman in 1982). The  m-variable fragment of first-order logic , denoted by FO m , consists of the first-order sentences which involve at most m variables. Our results imply that the  bounded variable hierarchy  FO 1  \u2282 FO 2  \u2282 ... \u2282 FO m  \u2282 ... is strict in terms of expressive power on finite ordered graphs. It was previously unknown that FO 3  is less expressive than full first-order logic on finite ordered graphs.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Benjamin Rossman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossman:Benjamin"], "pages": 10}
