We use interaction analysis, communication analysis, and task analysis methods to identify the primary activities teams engaged in as they solved a complex information dependant decision-making task. These activities serve as the foundation to present findings related to common team problems and patterns of interaction associated with team performance. We found differences between high and low performing teams related to verbal equity and how they shared and synthesized information.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Marcela Borge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borge:Marcela", "Craig H.
