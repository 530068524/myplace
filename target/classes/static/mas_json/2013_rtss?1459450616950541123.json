In a system with m processors, this arrangement limits the migrating tasks to at most m/2 and the number of migrations per job to at most m-1. HIME has a utilisation bound of at least 74.9%, and can be configured to achieve 75%, the theoretical limit for semi-partitioned schemes with at most m/2 migrating tasks. Experiments show that the average system utilisation achieved by HIME is about 95%.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["International Student Exchange Programs", "Nagoya University", "Comput.
