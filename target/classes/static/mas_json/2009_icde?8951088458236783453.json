{"title": "Weighted Proximity Best-Joins for Information Retrieval.", "fields": ["cross product", "ranking", "exploit", "score", "joins"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of efficiently computing weighted proximity best-joins over multiple lists, with applications in information retrieval and extraction. We are given a multi-term query, and for each query term, a list of all its matches with scores, sorted by locations. The problem is to find the overall best matchset, consisting of one match from each list, such that the combined score according to a scoring function is maximized. We study three types of functions that consider both individual match scores and proximity of match locations in scoring a matchset. We present algorithms that exploit the properties of the scoring functions in order to achieve time complexities linear in the size of the match lists. Experiments show that these algorithms greatly outperform the naive algorithm based on taking the cross product of all match lists. Finally, we extend our algorithms for an alternative problem definition applicable to information extraction, where we need to find all good matchsets in a document.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Google", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "IBM", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Risi Thonangi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thonangi:Risi", "Hao He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Hao", "AnHai Doan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doan:AnHai", "Haixun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haixun", "Jun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Jun"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
