Many voting systems are, in the general case, computationally resistant to some of these manipulative actions. However when restricted to single-peaked electorates, these systems suddenly become easy to manipulate. Recently, Faliszewski, Hemaspaandra, and Hemaspaandra (2011b) studied the complexity of dishonest behavior in nearly single-peaked electorates. These are electorates that are not single-peaked but close to it according to some distance measure.\n\nIn this paper we introduce several new distance measures regarding single-peakedness. We prove that determining whether a given profile is nearly single-peaked is NP-complete in many cases. For one case we present a polynomial-time algorithm. Furthermore, we explore the relations between several notions of nearly single-peakedness.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of Siegen", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["G\u00e1bor Erd\u00e9lyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erd=eacute=lyi:G=aacute=bor", "Martin Lackner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lackner:Martin", "Andreas Pfandler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfandler:Andreas"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
