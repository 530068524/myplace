Privacy is typically protected by anonymization, i.e., removing names, addresses, etc.We present a framework for analyzing privacy and anonymity in social networks and develop a new re-identification algorithm targeting anonymized social-network graphs. To demonstrate its effectiveness on real-world networks, we show that a third of the users who can be verified to have accounts on both Twitter, a popular microblogging service, and Flickr, an online photo-sharing site, can be re-identified in the anonymous Twitter graph with only a 12% error rate.Our de-anonymization algorithm is based purely on the network topology, does not require creation of a large number of dummy \"sybil\" nodes, is robust to noise and all existing defenses, and works even when the overlap between the target network and the adversary's auxiliary information is small.", "citation": "Citations (1,123)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Arvind Narayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanan:Arvind", "Vitaly Shmatikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shmatikov:Vitaly"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2009", "pages": 15}
