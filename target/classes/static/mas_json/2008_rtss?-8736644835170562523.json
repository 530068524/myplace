To our best knowledge, the only known work on this problem is the test condition proposed by Baruah for non-preemptive EDF scheduling, which will reject a task set with arbitrarily low utilization if it contains a task whose execution time is equal or greater than the minimal relative deadline among all tasks. In this paper, we firstly derive a linear-time test condition which avoids the problem mentioned above, by building upon previous work for preemptive multiprocessor scheduling. This test condition works on not only non-preemptive EDF, but also any other work-conserving non-preemptive scheduling algorithms. Then we improve the analysis and present test conditions of pseudo-polynomial time-complexity for Non-preemptive Earliest Deadline First scheduling and Non-preemptive Fixed Priority scheduling respectively. Experiments with randomly generated task sets show that our proposed test conditions, especially the improved test conditions, have significant performance improvements compared with [BAR-EDF np ].", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Nan Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Nan", "Wang Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi_0001:Wang", "Zonghua Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Zonghua", "Qingxu Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Qingxu", "Ge Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Ge"], "pages": 10}
