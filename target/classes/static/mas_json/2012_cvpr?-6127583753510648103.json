{"title": "General and nested Wiberg minimization.", "fields": ["bundle adjustment", "successive linear programming", "matrix decomposition", "factorization", "matrix"], "abstract": "Wiberg matrix factorization breaks a matrix Y into low-rank factors U and V by solving for V in closed form given U, linearizing V (U) about U, and iteratively minimizing \u2016Y-UV (U)\u2016 2  with respect to U only. This approach factors the matrix while effectively removing V from the minimization. Recently Eriksson and van den Hengel extended this approach to L 1 , minimizing \u2016Y-UV (U)\u2016 1 . We generalize their approach beyond factorization to minimize an arbitrary function that is nonlinear in each of two sets of variables. We demonstrate the idea with a practical Wiberg algorithm for L 1  bundle adjustment. We also show that one Wiberg minimization can be nested inside another, effectively removing two of three sets of variables from a minimization. We demonstrate this idea with a nested Wiberg algorithm for L 1  projective bundle adjustment, solving for camera matrices, points, and projective depths. We also revisit L 1  factorization, giving a greatly simplified presentation of Wiberg L 1  factorization, and presenting a successive linear programming factorization algorithm. Successive linear programming outperforms L 1  Wiberg for most large inputs, establishing a new state-of-the-art for for those cases.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Google"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dennis Strelow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strelow:Dennis"], "pages": 8}
