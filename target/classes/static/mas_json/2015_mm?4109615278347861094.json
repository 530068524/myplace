{"title": "Video Killed The Data Store: Extending the n-Dimensional Display Interface for Full Screen Video.", "fields": ["computer hardware", "framebuffer", "multimedia", "architecture", "data transmission"], "abstract": "Prior research introduced the n-Dimensional Display Interface (NDDI) as a new \" narrow waist \" for the display pipeline. In this paper, we extend the NDDI architecture to provide a blending feature. We then utilize that new feature for full screen video playback, leveraging application-level framing to realize a significant data transmission reduction. We then explore new NDDI configurations for effective rate control under highly constrained transmission budgets.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Charles D.
