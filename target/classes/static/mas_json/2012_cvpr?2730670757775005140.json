Outdoor webcams produce a large set of uncontrolled images subject to varying lighting and weather conditions. We first automatically select a suitable subset of the captured frames for further processing, reducing the dataset size by several orders of magnitude. A camera calibration step is applied to recover the camera response function, the absolute camera orientation, and to compute the light directions for each image. Finally, we describe a new photometric stereo technique for non-Lambertian scenes and unknown light source intensities to recover normal maps and spatially varying materials of the scene.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jens Ackermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ackermann:Jens", "Fabian Langguth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langguth:Fabian", "Simon Fuhrmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuhrmann:Simon", "Michael Goesele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goesele:Michael"], "pages": 8}
