However, how their interior bezels affect user performance and behavior has not been fully understood. We conducted three controlled experiments to investigate effects of tiled-monitor interior bezels on visual search, straight-tunnel steering, and target selection tasks. The conclusions of our paper are: 1) interior bezels do not affect visual search time nor error rate; however, splitting objects across bezels is detrimental to search accuracy, 2) interior bezels are detrimental to straight-tunnel steering, but not to target selection. In addition, we discuss how inte-rior bezels affect user behaviors, and suggest guidelines for effectively using tiled-monitor large displays and designing user interfaces suited to them.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Xiaojun Bi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bi:Xiaojun", "Seok-Hyung Bae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bae:Seok=Hyung", "Ravin Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Ravin"], "pages": 10}
