{"title": "A General Analysis of the Convergence of ADMM.", "fields": ["convex function", "rate of convergence", "dynamical system", "convergence", "compact convergence"], "abstract": "We provide a new proof of the linear convergence of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) when one of the objective terms is strongly convex. Our proof is based on a framework for analyzing optimization algorithms introduced in Lessard et al. (2014), reducing algorithm convergence to verifying the stability of a dynamical system. This approach generalizes a number of existing results and obviates any assumptions about specific choices of algorithm parameters. On a numerical example, we demonstrate that minimizing the derived bound on the convergence rate provides a practical approach to selecting algorithm parameters for particular ADMM instances. We complement our upper bound by constructing a nearly-matching lower bound on the worst-case rate of convergence.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Robert Nishihara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishihara:Robert", "Laurent Lessard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lessard:Laurent", "Benjamin Recht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Recht:Benjamin", "Andrew Packard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Packard:Andrew", "Michael I.
