Among various threats, dangerous goods such as gas and hazardous chemicals transported through and around cities have increasingly become the deadly \"bomb\" we sleep with every day. In both academia and government, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to dealing with dangerous goods transportation (DGT) issues, but further study is still in great need to quantify the problem and explore its intrinsic dynamics in a big data perspective. In this paper, we present a novel system called DGeye, which features a \"duet\" between DGT trajectory data and human mobility data for risky zones identification. Moreover, DGeye innovatively takes risky patterns as the keystones in DGT management, and builds causality networks among them for pain point identification, attribution and prediction. Experiments on both Beijing and Tianjin cities demonstrate the effectiveness of DGeye. In particular, the report generated by DGeye driven the Beijing government to lay down gas pipelines for the famous Guijie food street.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University", "Beihang University"], "authors": ["Jingyuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingyuan", "Chao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chao", "Junjie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Junjie", "Zhang Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Zhang"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
