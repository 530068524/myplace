{"title": "Dominant orientation templates for real-time detection of texture-less objects.", "fields": ["parsing", "limit set", "branch and bound", "template", "image texture"], "abstract": "We present a method for real-time 3D object detection that does not require a time consuming training stage, and can handle untextured objects. At its core, is a novel template representation that is designed to be robust to small image transformations. This robustness based on dominant gradient orientations lets us test only a small subset of all possible pixel locations when parsing the image, and to represent a 3D object with a limited set of templates. We show that together with a binary representation that makes evaluation very fast and a branch-and-bound approach to efficiently scan the image, it can detect untextured objects in complex situations and provide their 3D pose in real-time.", "citation": "Citations (229)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Department of C ...
