By performing adaptation against a word lattice, correct models are more likely to be used in estimating a transform. Further, a particular type of lattice proposed herein enables the use of a natural confidence measure given by the posterior occupancy probability of a state, that is, the statistics of a particular state will be updated with the current frame only if the a posteriori probability of the state at that particular time is greater than a predetermined threshold.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Lille University of Science and Technology", "University of Rennes", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Lille University of Science and Technology", "University of Rennes", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Lille University of Science and Technology", "University of Rennes", "Indiana University Bloomington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Cadi Ayyad University", "Cadi Ayyad University", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of South Florida", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "National University of Singapore", "University of Texas at Austin", "National University of Singapore", "SUNY, Korea"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Eric K.
