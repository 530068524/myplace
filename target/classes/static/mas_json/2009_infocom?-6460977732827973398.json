{"title": "Privacy in VoIP Networks: A k-Anonymity Approach.", "fields": ["public switched telephone network", "voice over ip", "information privacy", "call forwarding", "personalization"], "abstract": "Peer-to-peer VoIP (voice over IP) networks, exemplified by Skype, are becoming increasingly popular due to their significant cost advantage and richer call forwarding features than traditional public switched telephone networks. One of the most important features of a VoIP network is privacy (for VoIP clients). Unfortunately, most peer-to-peer VoIP networks neither provide personalization nor guarantee a quantifiable privacy level. In this paper we propose novel flow analysis attacks that demonstrate the vulnerabilities of peer-to-peer VoIP networks to privacy attacks. We present detailed experimental evaluation that demonstrates these attacks quantifying performance and scalability degradation.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Mudhakar Srivatsa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivatsa:Mudhakar", "Arun Iyengar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iyengar:Arun", "Ling Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ling"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
