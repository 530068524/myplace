We adopt a general model where the agents update their opinions in rounds to a weighted average of the opinions in their neighborhoods. For fixed neighborhoods, we present a simple randomized protocol that converges in expectation to the stable state of the Friedkin-Johnsen model. For opinion-dependent neighborhoods, we show that the Hegselmann-Krause model converges to a stable state if each agent's neighborhood is restricted either to a subset of her acquaintances or to a small random subset of agents. Our experimental findings indicate that for a wide range of parameters, the convergence time and the number of opinion clusters of the neighborhood-restricted variants are comparable to those of the standard Hegselmann-Krause model.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Dimitris Fotakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fotakis:Dimitris", "Dimitris Palyvos-Giannas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palyvos=Giannas:Dimitris", "Stratis Skoulakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skoulakis:Stratis"], "pages": 7}
