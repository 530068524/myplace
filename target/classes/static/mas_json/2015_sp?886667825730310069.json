{"title": "Micro-Policies: Formally Verified, Tag-Based Security Monitors.", "fields": ["the symbolic", "correctness", "cache", "memory safety", "instruction set", "controller", "security policy", "linker", "loader"], "abstract": "Recent advances in hardware design have demonstrated mechanisms allowing a wide range of low-level security policies (or micro-policies) to be expressed using rules on metadata tags. We propose a methodology for defining and reasoning about such tag-based reference monitors in terms of a high-level \"symbolic machine\" and we use this methodology to define and formally verify micro-policies for dynamic sealing, compartmentalization, control-flow integrity, and memory safety, in addition, we show how to use the tagging mechanism to protect its own integrity. For each micro-policy, we prove by refinement that the symbolic machine instantiated with the policy's rules embodies a high-level specification characterizing a useful security property. Last, we show how the symbolic machine itself can be implemented in terms of a hardware rule cache and a software controller.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Pennsylvania", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Arthur Azevedo de Amorim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amorim:Arthur_Azevedo_de", "Maxime D\u00e9n\u00e8s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=eacute=n=egrave=s:Maxime", "Nick Giannarakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giannarakis:Nick", "Catalin Hritcu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hritcu:Catalin", "Benjamin C.
