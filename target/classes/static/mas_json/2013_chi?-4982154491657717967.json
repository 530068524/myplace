We compared performance between older adults and younger adults on four desktop and touchscreen tasks: pointing, dragging, crossing and steering. On the touchscreen, we also examined pinch-to-zoom. Our results show that while older adults were significantly slower than younger adults in general, the touchscreen reduced this performance gap relative to the desktop and mouse. Indeed, the touchscreen resulted in a significant movement time reduction of 35% over the mouse for older adults, compared to only 16% for younger adults. Error rates also decreased.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Washington", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Leah Findlater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Findlater:Leah", "Jon Froehlich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Froehlich:Jon", "Kays Fattal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fattal:Kays", "Jacob O.
