We show that it is PPAD-hard to compute an approximate Arrow-Debreu market equilibrium in markets with linear and non-monotone utilities. Building on this result, we settle the long-standing open problem regarding the computation of an approximate Arrow-Debreu market equilibrium in markets with CES utilities, by proving that it is PPAD-complete when the Constant Elasticity of Substitution parameter, \u03c1, is any constant less than -1.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Columbia University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xi", "Dimitris Paparas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paparas:Dimitris", "Mihalis Yannakakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yannakakis:Mihalis"], "pages": 10}
