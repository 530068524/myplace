{"title": "Experience design theatre: exploring the role of live theatre in scaffolding design dialogues.", "fields": ["ageing", "scaffold", "experience design", "social group", "theatre director"], "abstract": "While theatre has been used in HCI as a tool for engaging participants in design processes, the specific benefits of using live theatre over other communicative mediums, remains underexplored. In this paper we introduce  Experience Design Theatre  (EDT) as an approach to undertaking experience-centered design with multiple parties in the early stages of design. EDT was motivated by a need to involve several diverse groups of people in the design of a digitally coordinated care service - NetCarers. We used live theatre as a way to engage small groups of participants in dialogues around the design of NetCarers, to qualify their contributions in a refined performance, and to communicate their concerns and aspirations to domain experts. We highlight key benefits to using live theatre in experience-centered design and offer insights for researchers undertaking similar work in the future.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["John Vines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vines:John", "Tess Denman-Cleaver.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denman=Cleaver:Tess", "Paul Dunphy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunphy:Paul", "Peter C.
