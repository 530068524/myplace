We address the problem of vertical selection, predicting relevant verticals (if any) for queries issued to the search engine's main web search page. In contrast to prior query classification and resource selection tasks, vertical selection is associated with unique resources that can inform the classification decision. We focus on three sources of evidence: (1) the query string, from which features are derived independent of external resources, (2) logs of queries previously issued directly to the vertical, and (3) corpora representative of vertical content. We focus on 18 different verticals, which differ in terms of semantics, media type, size, and level of query traffic. We compare our method to prior work in federated search and retrieval effectiveness prediction. An in-depth error analysis reveals unique challenges across different verticals and provides insight into vertical selection for future work.", "citation": "Citations (177)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Yahoo!", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Jaime Arguello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arguello:Jaime", "Fernando Diaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diaz_0001:Fernando", "Jamie Callan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Callan:Jamie", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Crespo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crespo:Jean=Fran=ccedil=ois"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
