As this logic naturally captures multi-player games with imperfect information, the problem turns out to be undecidable. We introduce a syntactical class of \u201chierarchical instances\u201d for which, intuitively, as one goes down the syntactic tree of the formula, strategy quantifications are concerned with finer observations of the model. We prove that model-checking SL ii  restricted to hierarchical instances is decidable. This result, because it allows for complex patterns of existential and universal quantification on strategies, greatly generalises previous ones, such as decidability of multi-player games with imperfect information and hierarchical observations, and decidability of distributed synthesis for hierarchical systems. To establish the decidability result, we introduce and study QCTL ii *, an extension of QCTL (itself an extension of CTL with second-order quantification over atomic propositions) by parameterising its quantifiers with observations. The simple syntax of QCTL ii * allows us to provide a conceptually neat reduction of SL ii  to QCTL ii * that separates concerns, allowing one to forget about strategies and players and focus solely on second-order quantification. While the model-checking problem of QCTL ii * is, in general, undecidable, we identify a syntactic fragment of hierarchical formulas and prove, using an automata-theoretic approach, that it is decidable. The decidability result for SL ii  follows since the reduction maps hierarchical instances of SL ii  to hierarchical formulas of QCTL ii *.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Rice University", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... , Naples, Italy", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... , Naples, Italy", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... , Naples, Italy"], "authors": ["Rapha\u00ebl Berthon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berthon:Rapha=euml=l", "Bastien Maubert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maubert:Bastien", "Aniello Murano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murano:Aniello", "Sasha Rubin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubin:Sasha", "Moshe Y.
