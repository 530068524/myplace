{"title": "An Efficient Minibatch Acceptance Test for Metropolis-Hastings.", "fields": ["metropolis hastings algorithm", "statistics", "acceptance testing", "machine learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "We present a novel Metropolis-Hastings method for large datasets that uses small expected-size minibatches of data. Previous work on reducing the cost of Metropolis-Hastings tests yield variable data consumed per sample, with only constant factor reductions versus using the full dataset for each sample. Here we present a method that can be tuned to provide arbitrarily small batch sizes, by adjusting either proposal step size or temperature. Our test uses the noise-tolerant Barker acceptance test with a novel additive correction variable. The resulting test has similar cost to a normal SGD update. Our experiments demonstrate several order-of-magnitude speedups over previous work.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Google", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Daniel Seita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seita:Daniel", "Xinlei Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Xinlei", "Haoyu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Haoyu", "John F.
