The proposed framework first estimates both blurring kernel and transformations of multiple LR faces by robust deblurring and registration in PCA subspace. A patch-wise mixture of probabilistic PCA prior is then incorporated for face super-resolution. Previous work on face SR using PCA prior can be viewed as special cases of the framework. Experimental results in both simulated and real LR sequences demonstrate very promising performance of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yonggang Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Yonggang", "Christos-Savvas Bouganis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouganis:Christos=Savvas"], "pages": 9}
