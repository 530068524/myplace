We use this perspective to compute (approximate) pathwise gradients for probability distributions not directly amenable to the reparameterization trick: Gamma, Beta, and Dirichlet. We further observe that when the reparameterization trick is applied to the Cholesky-factorized multivariate Normal distribution, the resulting gradients are suboptimal in the sense of optimal transport. We derive the optimal gradients and show that they have reduced variance in a Gaussian Process regression task. We demonstrate with a variety of synthetic experiments and stochastic variational inference tasks that our pathwise gradients are competitive with other methods.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Uber AI Labs", "Uber AI Labs"], "authors": ["Martin Jankowiak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jankowiak:Martin", "Fritz Obermeyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Obermeyer:Fritz"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
