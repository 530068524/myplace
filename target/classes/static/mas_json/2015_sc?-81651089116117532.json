{"title": "An input-adaptive and in-place approach to dense tensor-times-matrix multiply.", "fields": ["operand", "heuristic", "matrix multiplication", "multilinear algebra", "code generation"], "abstract": "This paper describes a novel framework, called I n T ens L i  (\"intensely\"), for producing fast single-node implementations of dense tensor-times-matrix multiply (T tm ) of arbitrary dimension. Whereas conventional implementations of T tm  rely on explicitly converting the input tensor operand into a matrix---in order to be able to use any available and fast general matrix-matrix multiply (G emm ) implementation---our framework's strategy is to carry out the T tm   in-place , avoiding this copy. As the resulting implementations expose tuning parameters, this paper also describes a heuristic empirical model for selecting an optimal configuration based on the T tm 's inputs. When compared to widely used single-node T tm  implementations that are available in the Tensor Toolbox and Cyclops Tensor Framework (C tf ), In-TensLi's in-place and input-adaptive T tm  implementations achieve 4\u00d7 and 13\u00d7 speedups, showing Gemm-like performance on a variety of input sizes.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Jiajia Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiajia", "Casey Battaglino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Battaglino:Casey", "Ioakeim Perros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perros:Ioakeim", "Jimeng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jimeng", "Richard W.
