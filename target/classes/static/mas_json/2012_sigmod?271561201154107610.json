Although plain MapReduce systems provide several benefits, they carry certain limitations that impact developer productivity and optimization opportunities. Higher level programming languages plus conceptual data models have recently emerged to address such limitations. These languages offer a single machine programming abstraction and are able to perform sophisticated query optimization and apply efficient execution strategies. In massively distributed computation, data shuffling is typically the most expensive operation and can lead to serious performance bottlenecks if not done properly. An important optimization opportunity in this environment is that of judicious placement of repartitioning operators and choice of alternative implementations. In this paper we discuss advanced partitioning strategies, their implementation, and how they are integrated in the Microsoft Scope system. We show experimentally that our approach significantly improves performance for a large class of real-world jobs.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jingren Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Jingren", "Nicolas Bruno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruno:Nicolas", "Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Wei"], "pages": 12}
