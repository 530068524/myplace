{"title": "TraceMatch: a computer vision technique for user input by tracing of animated controls.", "fields": ["ubiquitous computing", "tracing", "remote control", "gesture", "input device"], "abstract": "Recent works have explored the concept of movement correlation interfaces, in which moving objects can be selected by matching the movement of the input device to that of the desired object. Previous techniques relied on a single modality (e.g. gaze or mid-air gestures) and specific hardware to issue commands.  TraceMatch  is a computer vision technique that enables input by movement correlation while abstracting from any particular input modality. The technique relies only on a conventional webcam to enable users to produce matching gestures with any given body parts, even whilst holding objects. We describe an implementation of the technique for acquisition of orbiting targets, evaluate algorithm performance for different target sizes and frequencies, and demonstrate use of the technique for remote control of graphical as well as physical objects with different body parts.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "University of Milan", "Edinburgh Napier University", "University of Melbourne", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["Christopher Clarke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clarke:Christopher", "Alessio Bellino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellino:Alessio", "Augusto Esteves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esteves:Augusto", "Eduardo Velloso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Velloso:Eduardo", "Hans Gellersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gellersen:Hans"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 6}
