To explore the use of tags for communication in these systems, we report results from 33 user interviews and employ the concept of social roles to describe audience-oriented tagging, including roles of community-seeker, community-builder, evangelist, publisher, and team-leader. These roles contribute to our understanding of the motivations and rationales behind social tagging in an international company, and suggest new features and services to support social software in the enterprise.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Cornell University", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jennifer Thom-Santelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thom=Santelli:Jennifer", "Michael J.
