{"title": "Concentration of Multilinear Functions of the Ising Model with Applications to Network Data.", "fields": ["logarithm", "polynomial", "ising model", "multilinear map", "concentration of measure"], "abstract": "We prove near-tight concentration of measure for polynomial functions of the Ising model, under high temperature, improving the radius of concentration guaranteed by known results by polynomial factors in the dimension (i.e.~the number of nodes in the Ising model). We show that our results are optimal up to logarithmic factors in the dimension. We obtain our results by extending and strengthening the exchangeable-pairs approach used to prove concentration of measure in this setting by Chatterjee. We demonstrate the efficacy of such functions as statistics for testing the strength of interactions in social networks in both synthetic and real world data.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Constantinos Daskalakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daskalakis:Constantinos", "Nishanth Dikkala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dikkala:Nishanth", "Gautam C.
