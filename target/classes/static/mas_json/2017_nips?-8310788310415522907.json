The approach we take approximates the triggering function $f_{i,j}(t)$ by functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and maximizes a time-discretized version of the log-likelihood, with Tikhonov regularization. Theoretically, our algorithm achieves an $\\calO(\\log T)$ regret bound. Numerical results show that our algorithm offers a competing performance to that of the nonparametric batch learning algorithm, with a run time comparable to the parametric online learning algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yingxiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yingxiang", "Jalal Etesami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etesami:Jalal", "Niao He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Niao", "Negar Kiyavash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiyavash:Negar"], "pages": 10}
