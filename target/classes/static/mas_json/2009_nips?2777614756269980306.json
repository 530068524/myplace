Drawing inspiration from robust statistical model fitting, we estimate putative subspace hypotheses from the data. However, instead of ranking them we encapsulate the hypotheses in a novel Mercer kernel which elicits the potential of two point trajectories to have emerged from the same subspace. The kernel permits the application of well-established statistical learning methods for effective outlier rejection, automatic recovery of the number of motions and accurate segmentation of the point trajectories. The method operates well under severe outliers arising from spurious trajectories or mistracks. Detailed experiments on a recent benchmark dataset (Hopkins 155) show that our method is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of recovering the number of motions, segmentation accuracy, robustness against gross outliers and computational efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tat-Jun Chin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chin:Tat=Jun", "Hanzi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hanzi", "David Suter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suter:David"], "pages": 9}
