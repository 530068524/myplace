It manages metadata that are localized both temporally and spatially. They can also be hierarchical. Several visualization plugins have already been developped, enabling amalia.js to be deployed in a huge variety of web applications. We believe it can be used in various research areas to quickly visualize analysis results and to share them with the community. Amalia.js is an open-source software under a GPL license.
