Any such shape must have volume 1 and hence surface area at least that of the volume-1 ball, namely Omega(radicd). Our main result is a construction with surface area O(radicd), matching the lower bound up to a constant factor of 2radic2pi/eap3. The best previous tile known was only slightly better than the cube, having surface area on the order of d. We generalize this to give a construction that tiles Ropf d  by translations of any full rank discrete lattice Lambda with surface area 2piparV -1 par fb , where V is the matrix of basis vectors of Lambda, and par.par fb  denotes the Frobenius norm. We show that our bounds are optimal within constant factors for rectangular lattices. Our proof is via a random tessellation process, following recent ideas of Raz in the discrete setting. Our construction gives an almost optimal noise-resistant rounding scheme to round points in Ropf d  to rectangular lattice points.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Institute for Advanced Study"], "authors": ["Guy Kindler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kindler:Guy", "Ryan O'Donnell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Donnell:Ryan", "Anup Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Anup", "Avi Wigderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigderson:Avi"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
