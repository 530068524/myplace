To boost the performance of multi-view clustering, numerous subspace learning algorithms have been developed in recent years, but with rare exploitation of the representation complementarity between different views as well as the indicator consistency among the representations, let alone considering them simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view subspace clustering model that attempts to harness the complementary information between different representations by introducing a novel position-aware exclusivity term. Meanwhile, a consistency term is employed to make these complementary representations to further have a common indicator. We formulate the above concerns into a unified optimization framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets are conducted to reveal the effectiveness of our algorithm over other state-of-the-arts.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Tianjin University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xiaobo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaobo", "Xiaojie Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Xiaojie", "Zhen Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Zhen", "Changqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Changqing", "Stan Z.
