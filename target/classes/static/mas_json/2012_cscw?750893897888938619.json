{"title": "Finding a new normal: the role of technology in life disruptions.", "fields": ["social psychology", "computer supported cooperative work", "psychology", "domestic violence"], "abstract": "In recent years, the HCI and CSCW communities have begun to examine the role technology plays in personal, rather than professional settings. Part of this work has begun to address a specific class of life events that are unpredictable, uncontrollable, and destabilizing - what we refer to as  life disruptions . While each disruption is unique, we find that patterns of social and technical reconfigurations occur in a variety of different contexts. Drawing on three case studies of severe life disruptions - intimate partner violence, homelessness, and death - we remark on the ways that life disruptions prompt a journey towards a \"new normal.\" We enumerate the common lessons learned among our case studies and seek to inform future technology research and design work which may involve life disruptions.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Michael Massimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massimi:Michael", "Jill P.
