In this tutorial, we give an overview of the state-of-the-art techniques for supporting keyword search on structured and semi-structured data, including query result definition, ranking functions, result generation and top-k query processing, snippet generation, result clustering, query cleaning, performance optimization, and search quality evaluation. Various data models will be discussed, including relational data, XML data, graph-structured data, data streams, and workflows. We also discuss applications that are built upon keyword search, such as keyword based database selection, query generation, and analytical processing. Finally we identify the challenges and opportunities of future research to advance the field.", "citation": "Citations (199)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "University of New South Wales", "Arizona State University", "University of New South Wales"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Yi", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0011:Wei", "Ziyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ziyang", "Xuemin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xuemin"], "pages": 6}
