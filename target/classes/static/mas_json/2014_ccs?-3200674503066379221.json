As in functional encryption, C-FE allows a user (client) to learn only certain functions of encrypted data, using keys obtained from an authority. However, we allow (and require) the client to send a fresh key request to the authority every time it wants to evaluate a function on a ciphertext. We obtain efficient solutions by carefully combining CCA2 secure public-key encryption (or rerandomizable RCCA secure public-key encryption, depending on the nature of security desired) with Yao's garbled circuit. Our main contributions in this work include developing and for- mally defining the notion of C-FE; designing theoretical and practical constructions of C-FE schemes achieving these definitions for specific and general classes of functions; and evaluating the performance of our constructions on various application scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Indiana University Bloomington", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Muhammad Naveed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naveed_0001:Muhammad", "Shashank Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Shashank", "Manoj Prabhakaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakaran:Manoj", "XiaoFeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:XiaoFeng", "Erman Ayday.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ayday:Erman", "Jean-Pierre Hubaux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hubaux:Jean=Pierre", "Carl A.
