Given multiple images with different exposures, the proposed approach is capable of producing a pleasant tonemapped-like high dynamic range (HDR) image by compositing them seamlessly with the guidance of gradient-based quality assessment. Especially, two novel quality measures: visibility and consistency, are developed based on the observations of gradient changes among different exposures. Experiments in various static and dynamic scenes are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0021:Wei", "Wai-kuen Cham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cham:Wai=kuen"], "pages": 7}
