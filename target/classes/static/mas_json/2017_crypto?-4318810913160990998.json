Our scheme is secure based on the learning with errors (LWE) assumption. Our construction implies:\n\n1.\n\nA new construction for reusable garbled circuits that achieves stronger security than the only known prior construction [GKP+13].\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\nA new construction for bounded collusion functional encryption with substantial efficiency benefits: our public parameters and ciphertext size incur an additive growth of \\(O(Q^2)\\), where Q is the number of permissible queries (We note that due to a lower bound [AGVW13], the ciphertext size must necessarily grow with Q). Additionally, the ciphertext of our scheme is succinct, in that it does not depend on the size of the circuit. By contrast, the prior best construction [GKP+13, GVW12] incurred a multiplicative blowup of \\(O(Q^4)\\) in both the public parameters and ciphertext size. However, our scheme is secure in a weaker game than [GVW12].", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Madras"], "authors": ["Shweta Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Shweta"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 33}
