While 3D navigation is a core component of VR applications, certain situations, like remote displays in public or large visualization environments, do not allow for using a navigation controller or prop. NuNav3D maps hand motions, obtained from a pose recognition framework which is driven by a depth sensor, to a virtual camera manipulator, allowing for direct control of 4 DOFs of navigation. We present the NuNav3D navigation scheme and our preliminary user study results under two scenarios, a path-following case with tight geometrical constraints and an open space exploration case, while comparing our method against a traditional joypad controller.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Charilaos Papadopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadopoulos:Charilaos", "Daniel Sugarman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugarman:Daniel", "Arie E.
