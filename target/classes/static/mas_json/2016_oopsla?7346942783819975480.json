{"title": "GEMs: shared-memory parallel programming for Node.js.", "fields": ["web application", "abstraction", "javascript", "concurrency control", "thread safety"], "abstract": "JavaScript is the most popular programming language for client-side Web applications, and Node.js has popularized the language for server-side computing, too. In this domain, the minimal support for parallel programming remains however a major limitation. In this paper we introduce a novel parallel programming abstraction called  Generic Messages  (GEMs). GEMs allow one to combine message passing and shared-memory parallelism, extending the classes of parallel applications that can be built with Node.js. GEMs have customizable semantics and enable several forms of thread safety, isolation, and concurrency control. GEMs are designed as convenient JavaScript abstractions that expose high-level and safe parallelism models to the developer. Experiments show that GEMs outperform equivalent Node.js applications thanks to their usage of shared memory.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "JKU Linz, Austria"], "authors": ["Daniele Bonetta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonetta:Daniele", "Luca Salucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salucci:Luca", "Stefan Marr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marr:Stefan", "Walter Binder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Binder:Walter"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2016", "pages": 17}
