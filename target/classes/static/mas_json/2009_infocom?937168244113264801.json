{"title": "Exploiting Internet Delay Space Properties for Selecting Distinct Network Locations.", "fields": ["network model", "network delay", "adversary", "overlay network", "network performance"], "abstract": "Recent studies have discovered that the Internet delay space has many interesting properties such as triangle inequality violations (TIV), clustering structures and constrained growth. Understanding these properties has so far benefited the design of network models and network-performance-aware systems. In this paper, we consider an interesting, previously unexplored connection between Internet delay space properties and network locations. We show that this connection can be exploited to select nodes from distinct network locations for applications such as replica placement in overlay networks even when an adversary is trying to mis-guide the selection process.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Bo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Bo", "T.
