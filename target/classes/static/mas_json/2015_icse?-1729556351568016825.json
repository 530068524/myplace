{"title": "AutoCSP: Automatically Retrofitting CSP to Web Applications.", "fields": ["content security policy", "scripting language", "cross site scripting", "regression testing", "taint checking"], "abstract": "Web applications often handle sensitive user data, which makes them attractive targets for attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS). Content security policy (CSP) is a content-restriction mechanism, now supported by all major browsers, that offers thorough protection against XSS. Unfortunately, simply enabling CSP for a web application would affect the application's behavior and likely disrupt its functionality. To address this issue, we propose A uto CSP, an automated technique for retrofitting CSP to web applications. A uto CSP (1) leverages dynamic taint analysis to identify which content should be allowed to load on the dynamically-generated HTML pages of a web application and (2) automatically modifies the server-side code to generate such pages with the right permissions. Our evaluation, performed on a set of real-world web applications, shows that A uto CSP can retrofit CSP effectively and efficiently.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "National University of Singapore", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Mattia Fazzini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fazzini:Mattia", "Prateek Saxena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saxena:Prateek", "Alessandro Orso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orso:Alessandro"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
