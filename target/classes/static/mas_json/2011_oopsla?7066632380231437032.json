Because overlapping subproblems may not be apparent in the specification, it is desirable to obtain the algorithm directly from the specification. We describe a semi-automatic synthesizer of linear-time dynamic programming algorithms. The programmer supplies a declarative specification of the problem and the operators that might appear in the solution. The synthesizer obtains the algorithm by searching a space of candidate algorithms; internally, the search is implemented with constraint solving. The space of candidate algorithms is defined with a program template reusable across all linear-time dynamic programming algorithms, which we characterize as first-order recurrences. This paper focuses on how to write the template so that the constraint solving process scales to real-world linear-time dynamic programming algorithms. We show how to reduce the space with (i)~symmetry reduction and (ii)~domain knowledge of dynamic programming algorithms. We have synthesized algorithms for variants of maximal substring matching, an assembly-line optimization, and the extended Euclid algorithm. We have also synthesized a problem outside the class of first-order recurrences, by composing three instances of the algorithm template.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Yewen Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Yewen", "Rastislav Bod\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bod=iacute=k:Rastislav", "Saurabh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava_0001:Saurabh"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2011", "pages": 16}
