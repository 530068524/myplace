In C++, one place developers can find documentation is in a header file. When information is missing, they may look at the corresponding implementation code. To understand what's missing from C++ API documentation and the factors influencing whether it will be fixed, we conducted a mixed-methods study involving two experience sampling surveys with hundreds of developers at the moment they visited implementation code, interviews with 18 of those developers, and interviews with 8 API maintainers. In many cases, updating documentation may provide only limited value for developers, while requiring effort maintainers don't want to invest. We identify a set of questions maintainers and tool developers should consider when improving API-level documentation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Google", "North Carolina State University", "Google"], "authors": ["Andrew Head.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Head:Andrew", "Caitlin Sadowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadowski:Caitlin", "Emerson R.
