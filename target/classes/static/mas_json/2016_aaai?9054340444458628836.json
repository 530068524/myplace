It can discover sub-events from large amount of noisy event-related information in Twitter and semantically represent them. The task is challenging because tweets are short, informal and noisy. To solve this problem, we consider leveraging event-related hashtags that contain many locations, dates and concise sub-event related descriptions to enhance sub-event discovery. To this end, we propose a hashtag-based mutually generative Latent Dirichlet Allocation model(MGe-LDA). In MGe-LDA, hashtags and topics of a tweet are mutually generated by each other. The mutually generative process models the relationship between hashtags and topics of tweets, and highlights the role of hashtags as a semantic representation of the corresponding tweets. Experimental results show that MGe-LDA can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods for sub-event discovery.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Nankai University", "Nankai University", "Nankai University", "Nankai University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Chen Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Chen", "Yuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuan", "Jie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0007:Jie", "Yalou Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Yalou", "Wei-Ying Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Wei=Ying"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
