However, the technical trend of future data center design poses new challenges for efficient and scalable Multicast routing. First, the densely connected networks make traditional receiver-driven Multicast routing protocols inefficient in Multicast tree formation. Second, it is quite difficult for the low-end switches largely used in data centers to hold the routing entries of massive Multicast groups.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Dan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Dan", "Jiangwei Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jiangwei", "Junbiao Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Junbiao", "Jianping Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jianping"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
