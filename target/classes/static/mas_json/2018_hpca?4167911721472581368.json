{"title": "Comprehensive VM Protection Against Untrusted Hypervisor Through Retrofitted AMD Memory Encryption.", "fields": ["hypervisor", "protection mechanism", "page table", "memory management", "data security"], "abstract": "The confidentiality of tenant\u2019s data is confronted with high risk when facing hardware attacks and privileged malicious software. Hardware-based memory encryption is one of the promising means to provide strong guarantees of data security. Recently AMD has proposed its new memory encryption hardware called SME and SEV, which can selectively encrypt memory regions in a fine-grained manner, e.g., by setting the C-bits in the page table entries. More importantly, SEV further supports encrypted virtual machines. This, intuitively, has provided a new opportunity to protect data confidentiality in guest VMs against an untrusted hypervisor in the cloud environment. In this paper, we first provide a security analysis on the (in)security of SEV and uncover a set of security issues of using SEV as a means to defend against an untrusted hypervisor. Based on the study, we then propose a software-based extension to the SEV feature, namely Fidelius, to address those issues while retaining performance efficiency. Fidelius separates the management of critical resources from service provisioning and revokes the permissions of accessing specific resources from the un-trusted hypervisor. By adopting a sibling-based protection mechanism with non-bypassable memory isolation, Fidelius embraces both security and efficiency, as it introduces no new layer of abstraction. Meanwhile, Fidelius reuses the SEV API to provide a full VM life-cycle protection, including two sets of para-virtualized I/O interfaces to encode the I/O data, which is not considered in the SEV hardware design. A detailed and quantitative security analysis shows its effectiveness in protecting tenant\u2019s data from a variety of attack surfaces, and the performance evaluation confirms the performance efficiency of Fidelius.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Yuming Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yuming", "Yutao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yutao", "Ruifeng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ruifeng", "Haibo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Haibo", "Binyu Zang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zang:Binyu", "Haibing Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Haibing"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2018", "pages": 13}
