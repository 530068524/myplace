We describe in this paper activity recognition from patterns of object use for activities and a combined activity ontology. Activity-object use patterns are discovered to provide the knowledge of object concepts for routine activity concepts for an enhanced ontology-driven activity recognition.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of East London", "University of East London", "University of East London"], "authors": ["Isibor Kennedy Ihianle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ihianle:Isibor_Kennedy", "Usman Naeem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naeem:Usman", "Syed Islam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Islam:Syed"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
