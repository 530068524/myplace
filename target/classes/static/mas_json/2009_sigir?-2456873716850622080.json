{"title": "Ranking community answers by modeling question-answer relationships via analogical reasoning.", "fields": ["relational model", "semantic gap", "analogy", "thread", "user generated content"], "abstract": "The method of finding high-quality answers has significant impact on user satisfaction in community question answering systems. However, due to the lexical gap between questions and answers as well as spam typically existing in user-generated content, filtering and ranking answers is very challenging. Previous solutions mainly focus on generating redundant features, or finding textual clues using machine learning techniques; none of them ever consider questions and their answers as relational data but instead model them as independent information. Moreover, they only consider the answers of the current question, and ignore any previous knowledge that would be helpful to bridge the lexical and semantic gap. We assume that answers are connected to their questions with various types of latent links, i.e. positive indicating high-quality answers, negative links indicating incorrect answers or user-generated spam, and propose an analogical reasoning-based approach which measures the analogy between the new question-answer linkages and those of relevant knowledge which contains only positive links; the candidate answer which has the most analogous link is assumed to be the best answer. We conducted experiments based on 29.8 million Yahoo!Answer question-answer threads and showed the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Huazhong Scienc ... y, Wuhan, China", "Huazhong Scienc ... y, Wuhan, China"], "authors": ["Xin-Jing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xin=Jing", "Xudong Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Xudong", "Dan Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Dan", "Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lei"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
