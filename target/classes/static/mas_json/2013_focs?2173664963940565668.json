We present the first efficient algebraic algorithm to find an f-factor. The time is O(f(V ) \u03c9 ). More generally for graphs with integral edge weights of maximum absolute value W we find a maximum weight f-factor in time O\u0303(Wf(V ) \u03c9 ). (The algorithms are correct with high probability and can be made Las Vegas.) We also present three specializations of these algorithms: For maximum weight perfect f-matching the algorithm is considerably simpler (and almost identical to its special case of ordinary weighted matching). For the single-source shortestpath problem in undirected graphs with conservative edge weights, we define a generalization of the shortest-path tree, and we compute it in \u0303O\u0303(Wn \u03c9 ) time. For bipartite graphs, we improve the known complexity bounds for vertex-capacitated max-flow and min-cost max-flow on a subclass of graphs.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Warsaw"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Harold N.
