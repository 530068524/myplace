{"title": "Pushing Forward Marginal MAP with Best-First Search.", "fields": ["heuristics", "branch and bound", "search algorithm", "best first search", "graphical model"], "abstract": "Marginal MAP is known to be a difficult task for graphical models, particularly because the evaluation of each MAP assignment involves a conditional likelihood computation. In order to minimize the number of likelihood evaluations, we focus in this paper on best-first search strategies for exploring the space of partial MAP assignments. We analyze the potential relative benefits of several best-first search algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness against recent branch and bound schemes through extensive empirical evaluations. Our results show that best-first search improves significantly over existing depth-first approaches, in many cases by several orders of magnitude, especially when guided by relatively weak heuristics.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["IBM", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Radu Marinescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marinescu_0002:Radu", "Rina Dechter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dechter:Rina", "Alexander T.
