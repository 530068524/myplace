{"title": "Autonomous Skill Acquisition on a Mobile Manipulator.", "fields": ["mobile manipulator", "computer science", "dreyfus model of skill acquisition", "robot", "simulation"], "abstract": "We describe a robot system that autonomously acquires skills through interaction with its environment. The robot learns to sequence the execution of a set of innate controllers to solve a task, extracts and retains components of that solution as portable skills, and then transfers those skills to reduce the time required to learn to solve a second task.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["George Konidaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konidaris:George", "Scott Kuindersma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuindersma:Scott", "Roderic A.
