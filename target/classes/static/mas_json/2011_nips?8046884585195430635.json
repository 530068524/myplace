In many of these problems the amount of data in practice is so large that there is a constant need for faster algorithms. In this work we present the first sublinear time approximation algorithm for semidefinite programs which we believe may be useful for such problems in which the size of data may cause even linear time algorithms to have prohibitive running times in practice. We present the algorithm and its analysis alongside with some theoretical lower bounds and an improved algorithm for the special problem of supervised learning of a distance metric.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Dan Garber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garber:Dan", "Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
