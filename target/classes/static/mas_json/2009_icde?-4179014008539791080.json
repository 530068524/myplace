Here, an l-keyword query is specified by a set of l keywords, {k1, k2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , kl}. It finds how the tuples that contain the keywords are connected in a relational database via the possible foreign key references. Conceptually, it is to find some structural information in a database graph, where nodes are tuples and edges are foreign key references. The existing work studied how to find connected trees for an l-keyword query. However, a tree may only show partial information about how those tuples that contain the keywords are connected. In this paper, we focus on finding communities for an l-keyword query. A community is an induced subgraph that contains all the l-keywords within a given distance. We propose new efficient algorithms to find all/top-k communities which consume small memory, for an l-keyword query. For top kl-keyword queries, our algorithm allows users to interactively enlarge k at run time. We conducted extensive performance studies using two large real datasets to confirm the efficiency of our algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Lu Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Lu", "Jeffrey Xu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jeffrey_Xu", "Lijun Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Lijun", "Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
