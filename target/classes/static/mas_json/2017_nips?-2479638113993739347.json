Here we introduce a cognitive model capable of constructing human-like questions. Our approach treats questions as formal programs that, when executed on the state of the world, output an answer. The model specifies a probability distribution over a complex, compositional space of programs, favoring concise programs that help the agent learn in the current context. We evaluate our approach by modeling the types of open-ended questions generated by humans who were attempting to learn about an ambiguous situation in a game. We find that our model predicts what questions people will ask, and can creatively produce novel questions that were not present in the training set. In addition, we compare a number of model variants, finding that both question informativeness and complexity are important for producing human-like questions.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Anselm Rothe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rothe:Anselm", "Brenden M.
