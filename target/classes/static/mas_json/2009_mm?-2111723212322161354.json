This paper proposes a novel interactive approach for various and interesting 3D caricature generation based on double sampling. Firstly, according to user's operation, we obtain a coarse 3D caricature with local features transformation by sampling in well-built principle component analysis (PCA) subspace. Secondly, to utilize information of the 2D caricature dataset, we sample in the local linear embedding (LLE) manifold subspace. Finally, we use the learned 2D caricature information to further refine the coarse caricature by applying Kriging interpolation. The experiments show that the 3D caricature generated by our method can preserve highly artistic styles and also reflect the user's intention.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Xiangtan University", "Institute of Co ...
