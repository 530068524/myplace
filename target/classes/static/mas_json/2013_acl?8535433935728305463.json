This has motivated us to investigate two novel tasks: predicting the emotion of the addressee and generating a response that elicits a specific emotion in the addressee\u2019s mind. We target Japanese Twitter posts as a source of dialogue data and automatically build training data for learning the predictors and generators. The feasibility of our approaches is assessed by using 1099 utterance-response pairs that are built by five human workers.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Takayuki Hasegawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasegawa:Takayuki", "Nobuhiro Kaji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaji:Nobuhiro", "Naoki Yoshinaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshinaga_0001:Naoki", "Masashi Toyoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toyoda:Masashi"], "pages": 9}
