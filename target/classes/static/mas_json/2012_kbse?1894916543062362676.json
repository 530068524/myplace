Locating code that corresponds to features in such families is an important task in many software development activities, such as support for sharing features between different products of the family or refactoring the code into product line representations that eliminate duplications and facilitate reuse. We suggest two heuristics for improving the accuracy of existing feature location techniques when locating distinguishing features \u2013 those that are present in one product variant while absent in another. Our heuristics are based on identifying code regions that have a high potential to implement a feature of interest. We refer to these regions as diff sets and compute them by comparing product variants to each other. We exemplify our approach on a small but realistic example and describe initial evaluation results.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Julia Rubin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubin:Julia", "Marsha Chechik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechik:Marsha"], "pages": 4}
