{"title": "Modeling video viewing behaviors for viewer state estimation.", "fields": ["cognition", "computer vision", "gaze", "multimedia", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "Human gaze behaviors when watching videos reflect their cognitive states as well as characteristics of the video scenes being watched. Our goal is to establish a method to estimate the viewer states from his/her eye movements toward general videos, such as TV news and commercials. The proposed method is based on a novel model of video viewing behaviors, which takes into account structural and statistical relationships between video dynamics, gaze dynamics and viewer states. This model realizes statistical learning of gaze information while considering dynamic characteristics of video scenes to achieve viewer-state estimation. In this paper, we present an overview of the viewer-state estimation method based on the model of video-viewing behaviors, including several past work done by the author's team.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Kyoto University"], "authors": ["Ryo Yonetani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yonetani:Ryo"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
