Our approach was motivated by recent efforts in HCI to more closely align the development of interaction design theory to the craft knowledge and experiences of designers themselves. The resulting insights enhance our understanding of design approaches that a diverse group of ARG producers follow to create interactive, participatory narratives. We outline narrative-specific themes to support designers who craft similar interactive experiences.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Brigham Young University", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Elizabeth M.
