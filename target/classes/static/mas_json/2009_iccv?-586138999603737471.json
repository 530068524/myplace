However, having access to an object's silhouette assumes correct figure-ground segmentation, leading to a disconnect with the mainstream categorization community, which attempts to recognize objects from cluttered images. In this paper, we present a novel approach to recovering and grouping the symmetric parts of an object from a cluttered scene. We begin by using a multiresolution superpixel segmentation to generate medial point hypotheses, and use a learned affinity function to perceptually group nearby medial points likely to belong to the same medial branch. In the next stage, we learn higher granularity affinity functions to group the resulting medial branches likely to belong to the same object. The resulting framework yields a skeletal approximation that's free of many of the instabilities plaguing traditional skeletons. More importantly, it doesn't require a closed contour, enabling the application of skeleton-based categorization systems to more realistic imagery", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Bonn", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Bonn"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Alex Levinshtein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levinshtein:Alex", "Sven J.
