{"title": "A Partitioning Algorithm for Maximum Common Subgraph Problems.", "fields": ["subgraph isomorphism problem", "maximum common subgraph isomorphism problem", "speedup", "out of memory", "induced subgraph isomorphism problem"], "abstract": "We introduce a new branch and bound algorithm for the maximum common subgraph and maximum common connected subgraph problems which is based around vertex labelling and partitioning. Our method in some ways resembles a traditional constraint programming approach, but uses a novel compact domain store and supporting inference algorithms which dramatically reduce the memory and computation requirements during search, and allow better dual viewpoint ordering heuristics to be calculated cheaply. Experiments show a speedup of more than an order of magnitude over the state of the art, and demonstrate that we can operate on much larger graphs without running out of memory.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "authors": ["Ciaran McCreesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCreesh:Ciaran", "Patrick Prosser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prosser:Patrick", "James Trimble.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trimble_0001:James"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
