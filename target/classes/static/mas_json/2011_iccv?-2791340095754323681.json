The approach is based on the standard structure of cognitive visual attention models, but realizes the computation of saliency in each feature dimension in an information-theoretic way. The method allows a consistent computation of all feature channels and a well-founded fusion of these channels to a saliency map. Our framework enables the computation of arbitrarily scaled features and local center-surround pairs in an efficient manner. We show that our approach outperforms eight state-of-the-art saliency detectors in terms of precision and recall.", "citation": "Citations (245)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Bonn", "University of Bonn"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Dominik A.
