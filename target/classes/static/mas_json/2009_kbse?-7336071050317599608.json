In this paper, we introduce Clever, a novel clone-aware software configuration management (SCM) system. In addition to traditional SCM functionality, Clever provides clone management support, including clone detection and update, clone change management, clone consistency validating, clone synchronizing, and clone merging. Clever represents source code and clones as (sub)trees in Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), measures code similarity based on structural characteristic vectors, and describes code changes as tree editing scripts. The key techniques of Clever include the algorithms to compute tree editing scripts; to detect and update code clones and their groups; and to analyze the changes of cloned code to validate their consistency and recommend the relevant synchronization. Our empirical study on many real-world programs shows that Clever is highly efficient and accurate in clone detection and updating, and provides useful analysis of clone changes.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Tung Thanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Tung_Thanh", "Hoan Anh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hoan_Anh", "Nam H.
