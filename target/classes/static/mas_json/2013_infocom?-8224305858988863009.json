{"title": "Detecting encrypted botnet traffic.", "fields": ["encryption", "deep packet inspection", "network security", "cryptography", "botnet"], "abstract": "Bot detection methods that rely on deep packet inspection (DPI) can be foiled by encryption. Encryption, however, increases entropy. This paper investigates whether adding high-entropy detectors to an existing bot detection tool that uses DPI can restore some of the bot visibility. We present two high-entropy classifiers, and use one of them to enhance BotHunter. Our results show that while BotHunter misses about 50% of the bots when they employ encryption, our high-entropy classifier restores most of its ability to detect bots, even when they use encryption.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Colorado State University", "Colorado State University", "Colorado State University"], "authors": ["Han Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Han", "Christos Papadopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadopoulos:Christos", "Daniel Massey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massey:Daniel"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
