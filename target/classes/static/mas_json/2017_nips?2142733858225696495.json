Central to models of human visual attention is the saliency map. We propose a hierarchical visual architecture that operates on a saliency map and uses a novel attention mechanism to sequentially focus on salient regions and take additional glimpses within those regions. The architecture is motivated by human visual attention, and is used for multi-label image classification on a novel multiset task, demonstrating that it achieves high precision and recall while localizing objects with its attention. Unlike conventional multi-label image classification models, the model supports multiset prediction due to a reinforcement-learning based training process that allows for arbitrary label permutation and multiple instances per label.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Sean Welleck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welleck:Sean", "Jialin Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Jialin", "Kyunghyun Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Kyunghyun", "Zheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zheng"], "pages": 11}
