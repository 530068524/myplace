{"title": "Multiple Constraint Acquisition.", "fields": ["constraint learning", "drawback", "constraint logic programming", "hybrid algorithm", "constraint"], "abstract": "QUACQ is a constraint acquisition system that assists a non-expert user to model her problem as a constraint network by classifying (partial) examples as positive or negative. For each negative example, QUACQ focuses onto a constraint of the target network. The drawback is that the user may need to answer a great number of such examples to learn all the constraints. In this paper, we provide a new approach that is able to learn a maximum number of constraints violated by a given negative example. Finally we give an experimental evaluation that shows that our approach improves the state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Montpellier", "University of Montpellier", "University of Montpellier"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Robin Arcangioli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arcangioli:Robin", "Christian Bessiere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bessiere:Christian", "Nadjib Lazaar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazaar:Nadjib"], "pages": 7}
