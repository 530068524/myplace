{"title": "Assessing the Readability of Web Search Results for Searchers with Dyslexia.", "fields": ["cognition", "web page", "information retrieval", "readability", "dyslexia"], "abstract": "Standards organizations, (e.g., the World Wide Web Consortium), are placing increased importance on the cognitive accessibility of online systems, including web search. Previous work has shown an association between query-document relevance judgments, and query-independent assessments of document readability. In this paper we study the lexical and aesthetic features of web documents that may underlie this relationship. Leveraging a data set consisting of relevance and readability judgments for 200 web pages as assessed by 174 adults with dyslexia and 172 adults without dyslexia, we answer the following research questions: (1) Which web page features are most associated with readability? (2) To what extent are these features also associated with relevance? And, (3) are any features associated with the differences in readability/relevance judgments observed between dyslexic and non-dyslexic populations? Our findings have implications for improving the cognitive accessibility of search systems and web documents.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Adam Fourney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fourney:Adam", "Meredith Ringel Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Meredith_Ringel", "Abdullah Ali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ali:Abdullah", "Laura Vonessen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vonessen:Laura"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
