Discovery Dashboard offers interactive exploration tools and a data mining motif discovery algorithm to help researchers formulate hypotheses, discover trends and patterns, and ultimately gain a deeper understanding of their data. Discovery Dashboard emphasizes user freedom and flexibility during the data exploration process and enables researchers to do things previously challenging or impossible to do --- in the web-browser and in real time. We demonstrate our system visualizing data from a mobile sensor study conducted at the University of Minnesota that included 52 participants who were trying to quit smoking.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Memphis", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Dezhi Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Dezhi", "Fred Hohman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hohman:Fred", "Peter J.
