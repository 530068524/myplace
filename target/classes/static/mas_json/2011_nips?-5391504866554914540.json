{"title": "Similarity-based Learning via Data Driven Embeddings.", "fields": ["heuristic", "machine learning", "data driven", "adaptability", "sampling"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of classification using similarity/distance functions over data. Specifically, we propose a framework for defining the goodness of a (dis)similarity function with respect to a given learning task and propose algorithms that have guaranteed generalization properties when working with such good functions. Our framework unifies and generalizes the frameworks proposed by [1] and [2]. An attractive feature of our framework is its adaptability to data - we do not promote a fixed notion of goodness but rather let data dictate it. We show, by giving theoretical guarantees that the goodness criterion best suited to a problem can itself be learned which makes our approach applicable to a variety of domains and problems. We propose a landmarking-based approach to obtaining a classifier from such learned goodness criteria. We then provide a novel diversity based heuristic to perform task-driven selection of landmark points instead of random selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our goodness criteria learning method as well as the landmark selection heuristic on a variety of similarity-based learning datasets and benchmark UCI datasets on which our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Purushottam Kar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kar:Purushottam", "Prateek Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0002:Prateek"], "pages": 9}
