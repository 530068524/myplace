We follow the classic long take directing and editing schemes. This system automatically adjusts the projection velocity of raw video clips to enhance the aesthetic interest. We build up the mathematical model for projection rhythm manipulation based on film theories. The system segments interesting sub-shots and ordinary sub-shots within the single video clip. Different sub-shots are projected to different duration to maximize the video interest. The output video is rendered according to adjusted projection duration. Within this framework, we transform the screen rhythm and camera motion of a given single video shot. Motion interests of frames are re-distributed in projection duration modification and certain special projection patterns are introduced to enhance the aesthetic interest of original video. The user study shows that our scheme is very effective.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yang Yang Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Yang_Yang", "Mohan S.
