{"title": "Stratification driven placement of complex data: A framework for distributed data analytics.", "fields": ["programmer", "service layer", "agile software development", "data analysis", "complex data type"], "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of XML data stores, social networks and Web 2.0 and 3.0 applications, complex data formats, such as trees and graphs, are becoming ubiquitous. Managing and processing such large and complex data stores, on modern computational eco-systems, to realize actionable information efficiently, is an important challenge. A critical element at the heart of this challenge relates to the placement, storage and access of such tera- and peta- scale data. In this work we develop a novel distributed framework to ease the burden on the programmer and propose an agile and intelligent placement service layer as a flexible yet unified means to address this challenge. Central to our framework is the notion of stratification which seeks to initially group structurally (or semantically) similar entities into strata. Subsequently strata are partitioned within this ecosystem according to the needs of the application to maximize locality, balance load, or minimize data skew. Results on several real-world applications validate the efficacy and efficiency of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Ye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ye", "Srinivasan Parthasarathy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parthasarathy_0001:Srinivasan", "P.
