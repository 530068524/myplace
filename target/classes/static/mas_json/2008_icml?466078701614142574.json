Unfortunately, most POMDPs are defined with a large number of parameters which are difficult to specify only from domain knowledge. In this paper, we present an approximation approach that allows us to treat the POMDP model parameters as additional hidden state in a \"model-uncertainty\" POMDP. Coupled with model-directed queries, our planner actively learns good policies. We demonstrate our approach on several POMDP problems.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "McGill University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "McGill University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Finale Doshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doshi:Finale", "Joelle Pineau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pineau:Joelle", "Nicholas Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Nicholas"], "pages": 8}
