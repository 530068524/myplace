{"title": "A Semantic Approach for Iterated Revision in Possibilistic Logic.", "fields": ["operator", "algorithm", "satisfiability", "computation", "iterated function"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new approach for iterated revision in possibilistic logic by applying a one-step revision operator. We first argue that the set of KM postulates for revision is too strong to define a practical one-step revision operator and some of them should be weakened. We then present a semantic approach for iterated revision in possibilistic logic using a one-step revision operator. The computation of the semantic approach is given. We show that our revision approach satisfies almost all the DP postulates for iterated revision and some other important logical properties.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Guilin Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Guilin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
