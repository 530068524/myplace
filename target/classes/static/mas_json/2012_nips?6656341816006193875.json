{"title": "Approximating Concavely Parameterized Optimization Problems.", "fields": ["oracle", "optimization problem", "support vector machine", "parameterized complexity", "matrix completion"], "abstract": "We consider an abstract class of optimization problems that are parameterized concavely in a single parameter, and show that the solution path along the parameter can always be approximated with accuracy e > 0 by a set of size O(1/\u221ae). A lower bound of size \u03a9(1/\u221ae) shows that the upper bound is tight up to a constant factor. We also devise an algorithm that calls a step-size oracle and computes an approximate path of size O(1/\u221ae). Finally, we provide an implementation of the oracle for soft-margin support vector machines, and a parameterized semi-definite program for matrix completion.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Jena", "University of Jena", "University of Jena", "University of Jena"], "authors": ["Joachim Giesen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giesen:Joachim", "Jens K.
