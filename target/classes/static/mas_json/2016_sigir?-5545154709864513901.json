The model learns tweet embeddings using character-level CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder. We trained our model on 3 million, randomly selected English-language tweets. The model was evaluated using two methods: tweet semantic similarity and tweet sentiment categorization, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art in both tasks. The evaluations demonstrate the power of the tweet embeddings generated by our model for various tweet categorization tasks. The vector representations generated by our model are generic, and hence can be applied to a variety of tasks. Though the model presented in this paper is trained on English-language tweets, the method presented can be used to learn tweet embeddings for different languages.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Soroush Vosoughi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vosoughi:Soroush", "Prashanth Vijayaraghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vijayaraghavan:Prashanth", "Deb Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Deb"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
