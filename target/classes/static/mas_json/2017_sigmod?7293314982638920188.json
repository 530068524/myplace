Crowd Entity Resolution uses humans, in addition to machine algorithms, to improve the quality of the outcome. We study a hybrid approach that combines two common interfaces for human tasks in Crowd Entity Resolution, taking into account key observations about the advantages and disadvantages of the two interfaces. We give a formal definition to the problem of human task selection and we derive algorithms with strong optimality guarantees. Our experiments with four real-world datasets show that our hybrid approach gives an improvement of 50% to 300% in the crowd cost to resolve a dataset, compared to using a single interface.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Vasilis Verroios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verroios:Vasilis", "Hector Garcia-Molina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia=Molina:Hector", "Yannis Papakonstantinou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papakonstantinou:Yannis"], "pages": 16}
