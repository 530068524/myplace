{"title": "High-coverage, unbounded sound predictive race detection.", "fields": ["soundness", "real time computing", "dynamic program analysis", "java", "computer science"], "abstract": "Dynamic program analysis can predict data races knowable from an observed execution, but existing predictive analyses either miss races or cannot analyze full program executions. This paper presents Vindicator, a novel, sound (no false races) predictive approach that finds more data races than existing predictive approaches. Vindicator achieves high coverage by using a new, efficient analysis that finds all possible predictable races but may detect false races. Vindicator ensures soundness using a novel algorithm that checks each potential race to determine whether it is a true predictable race. An evaluation using large Java programs shows that Vindicator finds hard-to-detect predictable races that existing sound predictive analyses miss, at a comparable performance cost.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Jake Roemer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roemer:Jake", "Kaan Gen\u00e7.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gen=ccedil=:Kaan", "Michael D.
