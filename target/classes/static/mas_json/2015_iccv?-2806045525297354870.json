{"title": "Multi-label Cross-Modal Retrieval.", "fields": ["subspace topology", "pairing", "discriminative model", "linear subspace", "visual word"], "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of cross-modal retrieval in presence of multi-label annotations. In particular, we introduce multi-label Canonical Correlation Analysis (ml-CCA), an extension of CCA, for learning shared subspaces taking into account high level semantic information in the form of multi-label annotations. Unlike CCA, ml-CCA does not rely on explicit pairing between modalities, instead it uses the multi-label information to establish correspondences. This results in a discriminative subspace which is better suited for cross-modal retrieval tasks. We also present Fast ml-CCA, a computationally efficient version of ml-CCA, which is able to handle large scale datasets. We show the efficacy of our approach by conducting extensive cross-modal retrieval experiments on three standard benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed approach achieves state of the art retrieval performance on the three datasets.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "Yahoo!", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Viresh Ranjan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranjan:Viresh", "Nikhil Rasiwasia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rasiwasia:Nikhil", "C.
