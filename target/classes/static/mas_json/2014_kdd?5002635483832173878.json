In order to parallelize SGD, minibatch training needs to be employed to reduce the communication cost. However, an increase in minibatch size typically decreases the rate of convergence. This paper introduces a technique based on approximate optimization of a conservatively regularized objective function within each minibatch. We prove that the convergence rate does not decrease with increasing minibatch size. Experiments demonstrate that with suitable implementations of approximate optimization, the resulting algorithm can outperform standard SGD in many scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (194)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Baidu", "Baidu", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Mu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mu", "Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Tong", "Yuqiang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yuqiang", "Alexander J.
