In this paper, we therefore introduce a framework for proving 2-hypersafety properties by means of abstract interpretation. The main idea is to apply abstract interpretation on the self-compositions of the control flow graphs of programs. As a result, our method is inherently capable of analyzing relational properties of even dissimilar programs.   Constructing self-compositions of control flow graphs is nontrivial. Therefore, we present an algorithm for constructing quality self-compositions driven by a tree distance measure between the abstract syntax trees of subprograms. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the approach by proving intricate information flow properties of programs written in a simple language for tree manipulation motivated by the Web Services Business Process Execution Language.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Saarland University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["M\u00e1t\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kov=aacute=cs:M=aacute=t=eacute=", "Helmut Seidl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seidl:Helmut", "Bernd Finkbeiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finkbeiner:Bernd"], "pages": 12}
