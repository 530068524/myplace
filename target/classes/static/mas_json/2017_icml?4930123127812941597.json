Minimizing the standard notion of regret is computationally intractable. Thus, we define a natural notion of regret which permits efficient optimization and generalizes offline guarantees for convergence to an approximate local optimum. We give gradient-based methods that achieve optimal regret, which in turn guarantee convergence to equilibrium in this framework.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad", "Karan Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Karan", "Cyril Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Cyril"], "pages": 9}
