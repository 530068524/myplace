To meet the challenge caused by the delicate nature of thin branches, we make three innovations to cope with the sensitivity to image quality and calibration. First, we model the background as a harmonic function to improve the segmentation of the root in each 2D image. Second, we develop the concept of the regularized visual hull which reduces the effect of jittering and refraction by ensuring consistency with one 2D image. Third, we guarantee connectedness through adjustments to the 3D reconstruction that minimize global error. Our software is part of a biological phenotype/genotype study of agricultural root systems. It has been tested on more than 40 plant roots and results are promising in terms of reconstruction quality and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ying Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Ying", "Steve Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Steve", "Herbert Edelsbrunner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edelsbrunner:Herbert", "Carlo Tomasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomasi:Carlo", "Philip Benfey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benfey:Philip"], "pages": 8}
