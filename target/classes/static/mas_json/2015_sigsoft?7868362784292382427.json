UMTG employs Natural Language Processing (NLP), a restricted form of use case specifications, and constraint solving. Use cases are expected to follow a template with restriction rules that reduce imprecision and enable NLP. NLP is used to capture the control flow implicitly described in use case specifications. Finally, to generate test input, constraint solving is applied to OCL constraints referring to the domain model of the system. UMTG is integrated with two tools that are widely adopted in industry, IBM Doors and Rhapsody. UMTG has been successfully evaluated on an industrial case study.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences"], "authors": ["Chunhui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chunhui", "Fabrizio Pastore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pastore:Fabrizio", "Arda Goknil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goknil:Arda", "Lionel C.
