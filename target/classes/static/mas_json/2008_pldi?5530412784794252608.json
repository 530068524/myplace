{"title": "Immix: a mark-region garbage collector with space efficiency, fast collection, and mutator performance.", "fields": ["tracing", "free list", "copying", "garbage", "defragmentation"], "abstract": "Programmers are increasingly choosing managed languages for modern applications, which tend to allocate many short-to-medium lived small objects. The garbage collector therefore directly determines program performance by making a classic space-time tradeoff that seeks to provide space efficiency, fast reclamation, and mutator performance. The three canonical tracing garbage collectors: semi-space, mark-sweep, and mark-compact each sacrifice one objective. This paper describes a collector family, called  mark-region , and introduces  opportunistic  defragmentation, which mixes copying and marking in a single pass. Combining both, we implement  immix , a novel high performance garbage collector that achieves all three performance objectives. The key insight is to allocate and reclaim memory in contiguous regions, at a coarse  block  grain when possible and otherwise in groups of finer grain  lines . We show that immix outperforms existing canonical algorithms, improving total application performance by 7 to 25% on average across 20 benchmarks. As the mature space in a generational collector, immix matches or beats a highly tuned generational collector, e.g. it improves jbb2000 by 5%. These innovations and the identification of a new family of collectors open new opportunities for garbage collector design.", "citation": "Citations (139)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Stephen M.
