Our motivating application is guaranteed display advertising, a multi-billion dollar industry, whereby advertisers can buy targeted (high-dimensional) user visits from publishers many months or even years in advance. Forecasting high-dimensional data is challenging because of the many possible attribute combinations that need to be forecast. To address this issue, we propose a method whereby only a  sub-set  of attribute combinations are explicitly forecast and stored, while the other combinations are dynamically forecast on-the-fly using high-dimensional attribute correlation models. We evaluate various attribute correlation models, from simple models that assume the independence of attributes to more sophisticated sample-based models that fully capture the correlations in a high-dimensional space. Our evaluation using real-world display advertising data sets shows that fully capturing high-dimensional correlations leads to significant forecast accuracy gains. A variant of the proposed method has been implemented in the context of Yahoo!'s guaranteed display advertising system.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Deepak Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Deepak", "Datong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Datong", "Long-ji Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Long=ji", "Jayavel Shanmugasundaram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shanmugasundaram:Jayavel", "Erik Vee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vee:Erik"], "pages": 10}
