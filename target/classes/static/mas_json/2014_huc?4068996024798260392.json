The system employs Ubicomp technology to educate children on the importance of a balanced diet while motivating proper eating behavior. To sense a child's eating behavior, we have designed and prototyped a sensor-embedded digital fork, called the Sensing Fork. Furthermore, we have developed a story-book and persuasive game, called the Hungry Panda, on a smartphone. This capitalizes on the capabilities of the Sensing Fork to interact with and modify children's eating behavior during mealtime. We report the results of a real-life study that involves mother-child subjects and tested the effectiveness of the Sensing Fork and Hungry Panda game in addressing children's eating problems. Our findings exhibit positive effects for changing children's eating behavior.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Ochanomizu University", "National Taiwan University", "Future University Hakodate", "National Taiwan University", "Ochanomizu University"], "authors": ["Azusa Kadomura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kadomura:Azusa", "Cheng-Yuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Cheng=Yuan", "Koji Tsukada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsukada:Koji", "Hao-Hua Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Hao=Hua", "Itiro Siio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siio:Itiro"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
