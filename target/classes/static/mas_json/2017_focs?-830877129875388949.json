Our lightness bound is \\[O\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_H}{\u2265ilon^3}\\log \\frac{1}{\u2265ilon}\\right)\\] where \\sigma_H = |V(H)|\u221a{\\log |V(H)|} is the sparsity coefficient of H-minor-free graphs. That is, it has a practical dependency on the size of the minor H. Our result also implies that the polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) in H-minor-free graphs by Demaine, Hajiaghayi and Kawarabayashi is an efficient PTAS whose running time is 2^{O_H\\left(\\frac{1}{\u2265ilon^4}\\log \\frac{1}{\u2265ilon}\\right)}n^{O(1)} where O_H ignores dependencies on the size of H. Our techniques significantly deviate from existing lines of research on spanners for H-minor-free graphs, but build upon the work of Chechik and Wulff-Nilsen for spanners of general graphs[6].", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "University of Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Glencora Borradaile.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borradaile:Glencora", "Hung Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Hung", "Christian Wulff-Nilsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulff=Nilsen:Christian"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
