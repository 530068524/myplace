{"title": "Secure text processing with applications to private DNA matching.", "fields": ["substring", "pattern matching", "secure multi party computation", "text processing", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Motivated by the problem of private DNA matching, we consider the design of efficient protocols for secure text processing. Here, informally, a party P 1  holds a text T and a party P 2  holds a pattern p and some additional information y, and P 2  wants to learn {f(T,j,y)} for all locations j where p is found as a substring in T. (In particular, this generalizes the basic pattern matching problem.) We aim for protocols with full security against a malicious P 2  that also preserve privacy against a malicious P 1  (i.e., one-sided security). We show how to modify Yao's garbled circuit approach to obtain a protocol where the size of the garbled circuit is linear in the number of occurrences of p in T (rather than linear in $|T|$). Along the way we show a new keyword search protocol that may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Jonathan Katz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katz:Jonathan", "Lior Malka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malka:Lior"], "pages": 8}
