In this paper we explore the challenge of deriving methods that consider constraints on computation, appropriately schedule the next best computation to perform and finally have the capability of producing reasonable results at any time when a solution is required. We specifically derive an approach for the task of object category localization and classification in cluttered, natural scenes that can not only produce anytime results but also utilize the principle of value-of-information in order to provide the most recognition bang for the computational buck. Experiments on two standard object detection challenges show that the proposed framework can triage computation effectively and attain state-of-the-art results when allowed to run till completion. Additionally, the real benefit of the proposed framework is highlighted in the experiments where we demonstrate that the method can provide reasonable recognition results even if the procedure needs to terminate before completion.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vijayanarasimhan:Sudheendra", "Ashish Kapoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapoor:Ashish"], "pages": 8}
