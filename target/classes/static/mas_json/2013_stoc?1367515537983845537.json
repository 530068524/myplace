A key question is, how big is the advantage of exact quantum algorithms over their classical counterparts: deterministic algorithms? We present the first example of a total Boolean function $f(x_1,\\ldots, x_N)$ for which exact quantum algorithms have superlinear advantage over deterministic algorithms. Any deterministic algorithm that computes our function must use $N$ queries but an exact quantum algorithm can compute it with $O(N^{0.8675\\ldots})$ queries. A modification of our function gives a similar result for communication complexity: there is a function $f$ which can be computed by an exact quantum protocol that communicates $O(N^{0.8675\\ldots}\\log N)$ quantum bits but requires $\\Omega(N)$ bits of communication for classical protocols.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Latvia"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Andris Ambainis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ambainis:Andris"], "pages": 10}
