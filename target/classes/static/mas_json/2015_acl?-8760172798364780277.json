{"title": "Scalable Semantic Parsing with Partial Ontologies.", "fields": ["ontology", "noun phrase", "referring expression", "semantic analytics", "parsing"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of building scalable semantic parsers for Freebase, and present a new approach for learning to do partial analyses that ground as much of the input text as possible without requiring that all content words be mapped to Freebase concepts. We study this problem on two newly introduced large-scale noun phrase datasets, and present a new semantic parsing model and semi-supervised learning approach for reasoning with partial ontological support. Experiments demonstrate strong performance on two tasks: referring expression resolution and entity attribute extraction. In both cases, the partial analyses allow us to improve precision over strong baselines, while parsing many phrases that would be ignored by existing techniques.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Eunsol Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Eunsol", "Tom Kwiatkowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwiatkowski:Tom", "Luke Zettlemoyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zettlemoyer:Luke"], "pages": 10}
