{"title": "Dependency Hashing for n-best CCG Parsing.", "fields": ["semantic equivalence", "oracle", "natural language processing", "hash function", "parsing"], "abstract": "Optimising for one grammatical representation, but evaluating over a different one is a particular challenge for parsers and n-best CCG parsing. We find that this mismatch causes many n-best CCG parses to be semantically equivalent, and describe a hashing technique that eliminates this problem, improving oracle n-best F-score by 0.7% and reranking accuracy by 0.4%. We also present a comprehensive analysis of errors made by the C&C CCG parser, providing the first breakdown of the impact of implementation decisions, such as supertagging, on parsing accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Sydney", "University of Sydney"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Dominick Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Dominick", "James R.
