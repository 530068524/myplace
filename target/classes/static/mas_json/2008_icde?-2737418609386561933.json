{"title": "Network-Aware Join Processing in Global-Scale Database Federations.", "fields": ["hash join", "schedule", "overhead", "concurrent computing", "sort merge join"], "abstract": "We introduce join scheduling algorithms that employ a balanced network utilization metric to optimize the use of all network paths in a global-scale database federation. This metric allows algorithms to exploit excess capacity in the network, while avoiding narrow, long-haul paths. We give a two- approximate, polynomial-time algorithm for serial (left-deep) join schedules. We also present extensions to this algorithm that explore parallel schedules, reduce resource usage, and define tradeoffs between computation and network utilization. We evaluate these techniques within the SkyQuery federation of Astronomy databases using spatial-join queries submitted by SkyQuery's users. Experiments show that our algorithms realize near-optimal network utilization with minor computational overhead.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Xiaodan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaodan", "Randal C.
