This relies on well-timed and accurate information. Designing an in-vehicle information system it is important to ensure that the information for the driver does not negatively affect cognitive processing and driving performance. This study investigates levels of information accuracy necessary in in-vehicle information systems to elicit positive behavioral and attitudinal responses from the driver. In a 2 (gender) by 5 (accuracy: 100%, 88%, 76%, 64% and no system) between-participants study, 100 participants drove in a driving simulator for 25 minutes with an in-vehicle information system designed to inform the driver of hazard and traffic events. Results show that decreasing the accuracy of the system decreased both driving performance and trust and liking of car and in-vehicle system. Female drivers in particular benefit from the in-vehicle system and show higher tolerance of inaccuracies. Design implications for in-vehicle systems are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Link\u00f6ping University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ing-Marie Jonsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jonsson:Ing=Marie", "Helen Harris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harris:Helen", "Clifford Nass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nass:Clifford"], "pages": 10}
