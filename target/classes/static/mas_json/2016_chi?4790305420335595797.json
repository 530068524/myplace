However, quickly and accurately estimating the state of an RFID tag is difficult. In this work, we show how to achieve low-latency manipulation and movement sensing with off-the-shelf RFID tags and readers. Our approach couples a probabilistic filtering layer with a monte-carlo-sampling-based interaction layer, preserving uncertainty in tag reads until they can be resolved in the context of interactions. This allows designers' code to reason about inputs at a high level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a number of interactive objects, along with a library of components that can be combined to make new designs.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Disney Research", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Disney Research"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Andrew Spielberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spielberg:Andrew", "Alanson P.
