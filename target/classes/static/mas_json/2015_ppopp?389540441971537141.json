We evaluate 5 different synchronization techniques through a series of 31 data structure algorithms from the recent literature on 3 multicore platforms from Intel, Sun Microsystems and AMD. To this end, we developed in C/C++ and Java a new micro-benchmark suite, called Synchrobench, hence helping the community evaluate new data structures and synchronization techniques. The main conclusion of this evaluation is threefold: (i) although compare-and-swap helps achieving the best performance on multicores, doing so correctly is hard; (ii) optimistic locking offers varying performance results while transactional memory offers more consistent results; and (iii) copy-on-write and read-copy-update suffer more from contention than any other technique but could be combined with others to derive efficient algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Sydney"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Vincent Gramoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gramoli:Vincent"], "pages": 10}
