In this paper, we study multilayer adaptation for MGS-based bitstream. Our adaptation method not only considers which packets to be dropped, but also modifies layer dependency of NAL units to maintain bitstream conformance. Compared to conventional method of SVC, the proposed method can both expand the range of supported bitrates and improve the quality.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute", "Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute", "Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute", "Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"], "authors": ["Truong Cong Thang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thang:Truong_Cong", "Jung Won Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Jung_Won", "Jeong-Ju Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Jeong=Ju", "Jae-Gon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jae=Gon"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
