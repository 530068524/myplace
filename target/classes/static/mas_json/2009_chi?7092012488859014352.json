Such knowledge opens the door to a variety of innovations, ranging from improved Web page design to the creation of compact, yet recognizable, visual representations of long pages. We present an eye-tracking study in which 20 users viewed 361 Web pages while engaged in information foraging and page recognition tasks. From this data, we describe general location-based characteristics of visual attention for Web pages dependent on different tasks and demographics, and generate a model for predicting the visual attention that individual page elements may receive. Finally, we introduce the concept of fixation impact, a new method for mapping gaze data to visual scenes that is motivated by findings in vision research.", "citation": "Citations (250)", "departments": ["German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Georg Buscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buscher:Georg", "Edward Cutrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cutrell:Edward", "Meredith Ringel Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Meredith_Ringel"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
