Recently, researchers have devoted significant effort to devising new fuzzing techniques, strategies, and algorithms. Such new ideas are primarily evaluated experimentally so an important question is: What experimental setup is needed to produce trustworthy results? We surveyed the recent research literature and assessed the experimental evaluations carried out by 32 fuzzing papers. We found problems in every evaluation we considered. We then performed our own extensive experimental evaluation using an existing fuzzer. Our results showed that the general problems we found in existing experimental evaluations can indeed translate to actual wrong or misleading assessments. We conclude with some guidelines that we hope will help improve experimental evaluations of fuzz testing algorithms, making reported results more robust.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["George Klees.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klees:George", "Andrew Ruef.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruef:Andrew", "Benji Cooper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cooper:Benji", "Shiyi Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Shiyi", "Michael Hicks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hicks_0001:Michael"], "pages": 16}
