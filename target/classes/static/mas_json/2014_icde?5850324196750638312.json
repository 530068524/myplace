{"title": "Blazes: Coordination analysis for distributed programs.", "fields": ["declarative programming", "debugging", "program analysis", "scalability", "server"], "abstract": "Distributed consistency is perhaps the most discussed topic in distributed systems today. Coordination protocols can ensure consistency, but in practice they cause undesirable performance unless used judiciously. Scalable distributed architectures avoid coordination whenever possible, but undercoordinated systems can exhibit behavioral anomalies under fault, which are often extremely difficult to debug. This raises significant challenges for distributed system architects and developers. In this paper we present BLAZES, a cross-platform program analysis framework that (a) identifies program locations that require coordination to ensure consistent executions, and (b) automatically synthesizes application-specific coordination code that can significantly outperform general-purpose techniques. We present two case studies, one using annotated programs in the Twitter Storm system, and another using the Bloom declarative language.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Portland State University"], "authors": ["Peter Alvaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alvaro:Peter", "Neil Conway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conway:Neil", "Joseph M.
