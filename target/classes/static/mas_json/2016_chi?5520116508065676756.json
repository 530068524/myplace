{"title": "Virtual Objects as Spatial Cues in Collaborative Mixed Reality Environments: How They Shape Communication Behavior and User Task Load.", "fields": ["deixis", "workload", "mixed reality", "gesture", "user experience design"], "abstract": "In collaborative activities, collaborators can use physical objects in their shared environment as spatial cues to guide each other's attention. Collaborative mixed reality environments (MREs) include both, physical and digital objects. To study how virtual objects influence collaboration and whether they are used as spatial cues, we conducted a controlled lab experiment with 16 dyads. Results of our study show that collaborators favored the digital objects as spatial cues over the physical environment and the physical objects: Collaborators used significantly less deictic gestures in favor of more disambiguous verbal references and a decreased subjective workload when virtual objects were present. This suggests adding additional virtual objects as spatial cues to MREs to improve user experience during collaborative mixed reality tasks.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jens M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:Jens", "Roman R\u00e4dle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=dle:Roman", "Harald Reiterer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reiterer:Harald"], "pages": 5}
