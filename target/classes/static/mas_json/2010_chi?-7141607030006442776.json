{"title": "Multitasking and monotasking: the effects of mental workload on deferred task interruptions.", "fields": ["user experience design", "real time computing", "workload", "distributed computing", "human multitasking"], "abstract": "Recent research has found that forced interruptions at points of higher mental workload are more disruptive than at points of lower workload. This paper investigates a complementary idea: when users experience deferrable interruptions at points of higher workload, they may tend to defer processing of the interruption until times of lower workload. In an experiment, users performed a mail-browser primary task while being occasionally interrupted by a secondary chat task, evenly distributed between points of higher and lower workload. Analysis showed that 94% of the time, users switched to the interrupting task during periods of lower workload, versus only 6% during periods of higher workload. The results suggest that when interruptions can be deferred, users have a strong tendency to ''monotask'' until primary-task mental workload has been minimized.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dario D.
