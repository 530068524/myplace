{"title": "Virtual Team Networks: How Group Social Capital Affects Team Success in a Massively Multiplayer Online Game.", "fields": ["virtual team", "guild", "server log", "operationalization", "team effectiveness"], "abstract": "Virtual teams have become a ubiquitous form of organizing, but the impact of social structures within and between teams on group performance remains understudied. This paper uses the case study of a massively multiplayer online game and server log data from over 10,000 players to examine the connection between group social capital (operationalized through guild network structure measures) and team effectiveness, given a variety of in-game social networks. Three different networks, social, task, and exchange networks, are compared and contrasted while controlling for group size, group age, and player experience. Team effectiveness is maximized at a roughly moderate level of closure across the networks, suggesting that this is the optimal level of the group\u00e2  s network density. Guilds with high brokerage, meaning they have diverse connections with other groups, were more effective in achievement-oriented networks. In addition, guilds with central leaders were more effective when they teamed up with other guild leaders.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Grace A.
