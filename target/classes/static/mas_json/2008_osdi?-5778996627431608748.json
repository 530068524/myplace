{"title": "Mencius: Building Efficient Replicated State Machine for WANs.", "fields": ["paxos", "strong consistency", "low latency", "wide area network", "state machine replication"], "abstract": "We present a protocol for general state machine replication - a method that provides strong consistency - that has high performance in a wide-area network. In particular, our protocol Mencius has high throughput under high client load and low latency under low client load even under changing wide-area network environment and client load. We develop our protocol as a derivation from the well-known protocol Paxos. Such a development can be changed or further refined to take advantage of specific network or application requirements.", "citation": "Citations (152)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Yahoo!", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Yanhua Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Yanhua", "Flavio Paiva Junqueira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Junqueira:Flavio_Paiva", "Keith Marzullo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marzullo:Keith"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2008", "pages": 16}
