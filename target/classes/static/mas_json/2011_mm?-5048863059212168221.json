Our projected video profile contains both spatial and temporal information inclusively in a 2D image scroll that is continuous, compact, scalable, and indexing to each frame. To profile various types of video clips, we investigate the global flow field under all camera actions, and propose a uniformed scheme that uses a sampling line to cut the video volume across the major optical flow field. The resulting profile obtains an intrinsic scene space less influenced by the camera actions, and can be displayed in a video track to guide the access to video frames, and facilitate video browsing, editing, and retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis"], "authors": ["Hongyuan Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Hongyuan", "Jiang Yu Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Jiang_Yu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
