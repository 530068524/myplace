{"title": "Emulation and Approximation of a Flexible Delay Line by Parallel Non-Overtaking Delay Lines.", "fields": ["queuing delay", "end to end delay", "transmission delay", "processing delay", "elmore delay"], "abstract": "In this paper we propose to construct an flexible delay line with maximum delay d by parallel non-overtaking delay lines. We show that for a fixed number of non-overtaking delay lines, an optimal policy to minimize packet losses is to assign arriving packets to the non-overtaking delay line that has the largest residual service time while maintaining the FIFO order for each non-overtaking delay lines. Based on this optimal policy we show that to exactly emulate an flexible delay line, one needs [(d + 1)/2] non-overtaking delay lines. We also show that if one can tolerate a small packet loss probability, one just needs O(radic(d)) non-overtaking delay lines. In this case, we show that the residual service times of the non-overtaking delay lines behaved as if they followed the order statistics of uniform random variables.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University"], "authors": ["Duan-Shin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Duan=Shin", "Kai-Jie Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Kai=Jie", "Cheng-Shang Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Cheng=Shang", "Jay Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Jay"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
