Continuous model checking from revision to revision is not yet established as a standard practice, because the enormous resource consumption makes its application impractical. Model checkers compute a large number of verification facts that are necessary for verifying if a given specification holds. We have identified a category of such intermediate results that are easy to store and efficient to reuse: abstraction precisions. The precision of an abstract domain specifies the level of abstraction that the analysis works on. Precisions are thus a precious result of the verification effort and it is a waste of resources to throw them away after each verification run. In particular, precisions are reasonably small and thus easy to store; they are easy to process and have a large impact on resource consumption. We experimentally show the impact of precision reuse on industrial verification problems created from 62 Linux kernel device drivers with 1119 revisions.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "ISP RAS, Russia"], "authors": ["Dirk Beyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beyer_0001:Dirk", "Stefan L\u00f6we.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=ouml=we:Stefan", "Evgeny Novikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novikov:Evgeny", "Andreas Stahlbauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stahlbauer:Andreas", "Philipp Wendler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wendler:Philipp"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 11}
