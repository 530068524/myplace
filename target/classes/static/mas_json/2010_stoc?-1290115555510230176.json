Our main result is that random sparse linear codes are locally list-decodable and locally testable in the  high-error  regime with only a  constant  number of queries. More precisely, we show that for all constants c> 0 and \u03b3 > 0, and for every linear code C \u2286 0,1 N  which is:  sparse : |C| \u2264 N c , and  unbiased : each nonzero codeword in C has weight in (1/2 - N -\u03b3 , 1/2 + N -\u03b3 ), C is locally testable and locally list-decodable from (1/2 - e)-fraction worst-case errors using only poly(1/e) queries to a received word. We also give  subexponential time  algorithms for list-decoding arbitrary unbiased (but not necessarily sparse) linear codes in the high-error regime. In particular, this yields the first subexponential time algorithm even for the problem of (unique) decoding random linear codes of inverse-polynomial rate from a fixed positive fraction of errors. Earlier, Kaufman and Sudan had shown that sparse, unbiased codes can be locally (unique) decoded and locally tested from a constant fraction of errors, where this constant fraction tends to 0 as the number of codewords grows. Our results significantly strengthen their results, while also having significantly simpler proofs. At the heart of our algorithms is a natural \"self-correcting\" operation defined on codes and received words. This self-correcting operation transforms a code C with a received word  w  into a simpler code C' and a related received word w', such that w is close to C if and only if w' is close to C'. Starting with a sparse, unbiased code C and an arbitrary received word w, a constant number of applications of the self-correcting operation reduces us to the case of local list-decoding and testing for the   Hadamard code , for which the well known algorithms of Goldreich-Levin and Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld are available. This yields the constant-query local algorithms for the original code C. Our algorithm for decoding unbiased linear codes in subexponential time proceeds similarly. Applying the self-correcting operation to an unbiased code C and an arbitrary received word a super-constant number of times, we get reduced to the problem of  learning noisy parities , for which non-trivial subexponential time algorithms were recently given by Blum-Kalai-Wasserman and Feldman-Gopalan-Khot-Ponnuswami. Our result generalizes a result of Lyubashevsky, which gave a subexponential time algorithm for decoding random linear codes of inverse-polynomial rate from  random errors .", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Swastik Kopparty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopparty:Swastik", "Shubhangi Saraf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saraf:Shubhangi"], "pages": 10}
