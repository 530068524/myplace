Increasing pathdiversity by advertising multiple paths is an effective strategyto achieve reliable interdomain routing. However, designing ascalable and ef\ufb01cient multiple path advertisement to enhancethe reliability of interdomain routing is still challenging. In thispaper, we propose two path diversity aware routing protocols,D-BGP and B-BGP, to improve the resilience of interdomainrouting. The two protocols can establish multiple paths with lowrouting overhead by exploiting the path diversity existing in theunderlying network infrastructure. We evaluate the reliabilityimprovements by simulation. I. I NTRODUCTION With the continued growth of the Internet, new and largescale mission critical applications, such as Voice-over-IP(VoIP) applications, multiplayer games, and video confer-encing, are widely deployed. The reliability of the Internetbecomes very important to maintain the performance of thoseapplications. Unfortunately, Internet path failures are fairlycommon and can impact those applications [11], [10]. Tosupport these applications in the face of failures, it is cru-cial that the underlying network infrastructure provides highredundancy and that the routing system can fully exploit theredundancy of the underlying network infrastructure to quicklyrecover from failures.However, BGP, the current", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Liberty University", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Feng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0017:Feng", "Lixin Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Lixin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
