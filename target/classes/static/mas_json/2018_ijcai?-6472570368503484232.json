We show how questions on the complexity of their subclasses can be solved using existing results via the powerful use of primitive positive (pp) interpretations and pp-homotopy. We demonstrate the methodology by giving a full complexity classification of all constraint languages that are first-order definable in Allen's Interval Algebra and contain the basic relations (s) and (f). In the case of the Rectangle Algebra we answer in the affirmative the old open question as to whether ORD-Horn is a maximally tractable subset among the (disjunctive, binary) relations. We then generalise our results for the Rectangle Algebra to the r-dimensional Block Algebra.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Link\u00f6ping University", "Durham University", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Manuel Bodirsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bodirsky:Manuel", "Peter Jonsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jonsson:Peter", "Barnaby Martin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martin:Barnaby", "Antoine Mottet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mottet:Antoine"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
