A general secret sharing scheme for  n  parties is associated to a monotone function  F :{0,1}  n  \u2192{0,1}. In such a scheme, a dealer distributes shares of a secret  s  among  n  parties. Any subset of parties  T  \u2286 [ n ] should be able to put together their shares and reconstruct the secret  s  if  F ( T )=1, and should have no information about  s  if  F ( T )=0. One of the major long-standing questions in information-theoretic cryptography is to minimize the (total) size of the shares in a secret-sharing scheme for arbitrary monotone functions  F .    There is a large gap between lower and upper bounds for secret sharing. The best known scheme for general  F  has shares of size 2  n \u2212 o ( n ) , but the best lower bound is \u03a9( n  2 /log n ). Indeed, the exponential share size is a direct result of the fact that in all known secret-sharing schemes, the share size grows with the size of a circuit (or formula, or monotone span program) for  F . Indeed, several researchers have suggested the existence of a  representation size barrier  which implies that the right answer is closer to the upper bound, namely, 2  n \u2212 o ( n ) .    In this work, we overcome this barrier by constructing a secret sharing scheme for any access structure with shares of size 2 0.994 n   and a linear secret sharing scheme for any access structure with shares of size 2 0.999 n  . As a contribution of independent interest, we also construct a secret sharing scheme with shares of size 2 O(\u221a n )  for 2  n   n /2  monotone access structures, out of a total of 2  n   n /2\u00b7 (1+ O (log n / n ))  of them. Our construction builds on recent works that construct better protocols for the conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) problem.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Tianren Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Tianren", "Vinod Vaikuntanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaikuntanathan:Vinod"], "pages": 10}
