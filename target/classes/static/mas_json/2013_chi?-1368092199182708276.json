Simple living refers to a lifestyle which is voluntarily simple out of concern for both the environment and quality of life. Our goal was to learn about a holistic view on sustainability and the role of ICT in helping and hindering families to live simply. The study contributes new insights about how holistic sustainability could be a valuable lens for HCI, revealing that sustainability is important to a wider range of areas in HCI than previously discussed. We conclude with implications for HCI for how to support sustainable practices beyond being \"about\" being green.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Maria H\u00e5kansson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=aring=kansson:Maria", "Phoebe Sengers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sengers:Phoebe"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
