{"title": "Space Defragmentation Heuristic for 2D and 3D Bin Packing Problems.", "fields": ["bin", "shuffling", "bin packing problem", "packing problems", "defragmentation"], "abstract": "One of main difficulties of multi-dimensional packing problems is the fragmentation of free space into several unusable small parts after a few items are packed. This study proposes a defragmentation technique to combine the fragmented space into a continuous usable space, which potentially allows the packing of additional items. We illustrate the effectiveness of this technique on the two-and three-dimensional Bin Packing Problems. In conjunction with a bin shuffling strategy for incremental improvement, our resultant algorithm outperforms all leading meta-heuristic approaches.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "City Univ. of H ... ong, HK S.A.R.", "City Univ. of H ... ong, HK S.A.R."], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhaoyi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhaoyi", "Songshan Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Songshan", "Wenbin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Wenbin", "Wee-Chong Oon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oon:Wee=Chong", "Andrew Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Andrew"], "pages": 6}
