First, we show that the resolution rule for Max-SAT can be safely applied as dictated by the resolution proof associated with an unsatisfiable core when such proof is read-once, that is, each clause is used at most once in the resolution process. Second, we study how this property can be integrated in an unsatisfiability-based solver. In particular, the resolution rule for Max-SAT is applied to read-once proofs or to read-once subparts of a general proof. Finally, we perform an empirical investigation on structured instances from recent Max-SAT evaluations. Preliminary results show that the use of read-once resolution substantially improves the performance of the solver.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University College Dublin", "University College Dublin"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Federico Heras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heras:Federico", "Jo\u00e3o Marques-Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marques=Silva:Jo=atilde=o"], "pages": 6}
