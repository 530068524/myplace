This problem is a very challenging combinatorial optimization problem and has attracted much academic attention. To solve it, most of the literature articles adopted heuristic approaches in which the solution is represented by a set of delivery patterns, and the search operators were derived from the traditional VRP operators. Differently, our approach employs the combination of a set of routes and a forest to represent the solution. Several forest-based operators are accordingly introduced. We integrate the new operators into a simple tabu search framework and then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by conducting experiments on existing benchmark instances.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "City University of Hong Kong", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Zizhen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zizhen", "Huang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Huang", "Zhixing Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Zhixing", "Hu Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Hu", "Songshan Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Songshan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
