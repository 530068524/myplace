We show that the cocktail party problem, or the speech separation problem, can be effectively approached via structured prediction. To account for temporal dynamics in speech, we employ conditional random fields (CRFs) to classify speech dominance within each time-frequency unit for a sound mixture. To capture complex, nonlinear relationship between input and output, both state and transition feature functions in CRFs are learned by deep neural networks. The formulation of the problem as classification allows us to directly optimize a measure that is well correlated with human speech intelligibility. The proposed system substantially outperforms existing ones in a variety of noises.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Yuxuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuxuan", "DeLiang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:DeLiang"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
