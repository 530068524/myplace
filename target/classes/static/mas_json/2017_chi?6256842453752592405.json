However, the Stories feature of Snapchat offers a different perspective of ephemeral content sharing, with pictures and videos that are available for friends to watch an unlimited number of times for 24 hours. We conduct-ed an in-depth qualitative investigation by interviewing 18 participants and reviewing 14 days of their Stories posts. We identify five themes focused on how participants perceive and use the Stories feature, and apply a Goffmanesque metaphor to our analysis. We relate the Stories medium to other research on self-presentation and identity curation in social media.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sarah McRoberts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McRoberts:Sarah", "Haiwei Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Haiwei", "Andrew Hall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hall:Andrew", "Svetlana Yarosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yarosh:Svetlana"], "pages": 10}
