We adopt and analyze a synchronous K-step averaging stochastic gradient descent algorithm which we call K-AVG. We establish the convergence results of K-AVG for nonconvex objectives and explain why the K-step delay is necessary and leads to better performance than traditional parallel stochastic gradient descent which is a special case of K-AVG with $K=1$. We also show that K-AVG scales better than ASGD. Another advantage of K-AVG over ASGD is that it allows larger stepsizes. On a cluster of $128$ GPUs, K-AVG is faster than ASGD implementations and achieves better accuracies and faster convergence for \\cifar dataset.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "IBM"], "authors": ["Fan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Fan", "Guojing Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Guojing"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
