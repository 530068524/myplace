In this paper, we extend classical AI behavior composition to manufacturing settings. We first introduce a novel solution concept for manufacturing composition, target production processes, that are able to manufacture multiple instances of a product simultaneously in a given production plant. We then propose a technique for synthesizing the largest target production process, together with an associated controller for the machines in the plant.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "RMIT University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Paolo Felli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felli:Paolo", "Brian Logan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Logan:Brian", "Sebastian Sardi\u00f1a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sardi=ntilde=a:Sebastian"], "pages": 8}
