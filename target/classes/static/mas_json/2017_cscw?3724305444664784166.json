{"title": "Socially Embedded Work: A Study of Wheelchair Users Performing Online Crowd Work in China.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "wheelchair", "information and communications technology", "workforce", "embeddedness"], "abstract": "Information and Communications Technology (ICT) affords new opportunities for people with disabilities to participate in the workforce. However, little research has investigated how people with disabilities access and perform work through ICT. This paper presents a study of how people with disabilities, particularly those who are wheelchair users, perform online crowd work in China. We highlight an online crowd work practice that is highly embedded in social relationships that are developed through ICT over time. We call this socially embedded work to distinguish it from previous studies describing online crowd work as being devoid of social relationships. Our study uncovers the unique developmental dynamics of the online crowd work community self-organized by wheelchair users in China. Findings suggest that an ecosystem that focuses on fostering social relationships among the stakeholders can potentially address the wide range of issues of online crowd work reported in current crowd work literature.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Xianghua Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Xianghua", "Patrick C.
