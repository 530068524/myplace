We provide both a narrowblock design StE and a wideblock design EtE. Our proofs assume only standard PRP-CCA security of the underlying tweakable ciphers.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "IBM", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "David Cash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cash:David", "Sriram Keelveedhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keelveedhi:Sriram"], "pages": 10}
