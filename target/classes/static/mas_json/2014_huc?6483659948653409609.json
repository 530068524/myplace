In this paper, we present a thermal power harvester that utilizes naturally changing ambient temperature in the environment as the power source. In contrast to traditional thermoelectric power harvesters, our approach does not require a spatial temperature gradient; instead it relies on temperature fluctuations over time, enabling it to be used freestanding in any environment in which temperature changes throughout the day. By mechanically coupling linear motion harvesters with a temperature sensitive bellows, we show the capability of harvesting up to 21 mJ of energy per cycle of temperature variation within the range 5 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C. We also demonstrate the ability to power a sensor node, transmit sensor data wirelessly, and update a bistable E-ink display after as little as a 0.25 \u00b0C ambient temperature change.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Chen Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Chen", "Sam Yisrael.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yisrael:Sam", "Joshua R.
