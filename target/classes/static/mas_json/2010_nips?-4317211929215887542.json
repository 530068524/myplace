This class includes drawable (D), canonical (C) and regular vines developed in [5] and [4]. Estimation and model selection methods are studied both in a classical as well as in a Bayesian setting. This flexible class of multivariate copulas can be applied to model complex dependencies. Literature to applications in modeling financial data as well as Bayesian belief networks are provided. It closes with a section on open problems.", "citation": "Citations (208)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "University of Minnesota", "Kansas State University", "University of Minnesota", "Woosuk University", "Seoul National University", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Matem\u00e1ticas", "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Matem\u00e1ticas", "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Matem\u00e1ticas", "University of Strathclyde", "Cranfield University", "University of Strathclyde", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Gal Elidan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elidan:Gal"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
