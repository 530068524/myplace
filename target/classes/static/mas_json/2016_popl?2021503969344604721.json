{"title": "Automatic patch generation by learning correct code.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "test case", "software", "correctness", "ranking"], "abstract": "We present Prophet, a novel patch generation system that works with a set of successful human patches obtained from open- source software repositories to learn a probabilistic, application-independent model of correct code. It generates a space of candidate patches, uses the model to rank the candidate patches in order of likely correctness, and validates the ranked patches against a suite of test cases to find correct patches. Experimental results show that, on a benchmark set of 69 real-world defects drawn from eight open-source projects, Prophet significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art patch generation system.", "citation": "Citations (194)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Fan Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Fan", "Martin Rinard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rinard:Martin"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2016", "pages": 15}
