{"title": "Commitment Tracking via the Reactive Event Calculus.", "fields": ["domain knowledge", "logic programming", "cache", "event calculus", "abductive logic programming"], "abstract": "Runtime commitment verification is an important, open issue in multiagent research. To address it, we build on Yolum and Singh's formalization of commitment operations, on Chittaro and Montanari's cached event calculus, and on the SCIFF abductive logic programming proof-procedure. We propose a framework consisting of a declarative and compact language to express the domain knowledge, and a reactive and complete procedure to track the status of commitments effectively, producing provably sound and irrevocable answers.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["University of Bologna", "University of Bologna", "University of Bologna", "University of Bologna"], "authors": ["Federico Chesani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chesani:Federico", "Paola Mello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mello:Paola", "Marco Montali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montali:Marco", "Paolo Torroni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torroni:Paolo"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
