Often, researchers analyze instrumented behavior in isolation from other data. The problem with collecting instrumented behaviors without attitudinal, demographic, and contextual data is that researchers have no way to answer the 'why' behind the 'what'. We have combined the collection and analysis of behavioral instrumentation with other HCI methods to develop a system for Tracking Real-Time User Experience (TRUE). Using two case studies as examples, we demonstrate how we have evolved instrumentation methodology and analysis to extensively improve the design of video games. It is our hope that TRUE is adopted and adapted by the broader HCI community, becoming a useful tool for gaining deep insights into user behavior and improvement of design for other complex systems.", "citation": "Citations (277)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jun H.
