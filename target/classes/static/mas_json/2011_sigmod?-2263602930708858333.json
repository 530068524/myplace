{"title": "Inspector gadget: a framework for custom monitoring and debugging of distributed dataflows.", "fields": ["debugging", "java", "computer architecture", "dataflow", "gadget", "algorithmic program debugging", "custom", "computer science"], "abstract": "We demonstrate a novel dataflow introspection framework called Inspector Gadget, which makes it easy to create custom monitoring and debugging add-ons to an existing dataflow engine such as Pig. The framework is motivated by a series of informal user interviews, which revealed that dataflow monitoring and debugging needs are both pressing and diverse. Of the 14 monitoring/debugging behaviors requested by users, we were able to implement 12 in Inspector Gadget, in just a few hundred lines of (Java) code each.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Christopher Olston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olston:Christopher", "Benjamin Reed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reed:Benjamin"], "pages": 4}
