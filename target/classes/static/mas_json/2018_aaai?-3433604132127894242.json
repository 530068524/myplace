{"title": "Schur Number Five.", "fields": ["automated proof checking", "massively parallel", "existential quantification", "correctness", "trustworthiness"], "abstract": "We present the solution of a century-old problem known as Schur Number Five: What is the largest (natural) number $n$ such that there exists a five-coloring of the positive numbers up to $n$ without a monochromatic solution of the equation $a + b = c$? We obtained the solution, $n = 160$, by encoding the problem into propositional logic and applying massively parallel satisfiability solving techniques on the resulting formula. We constructed and validated a proof of the solution to increase trust in the correctness of the multi-CPU-year computations. The proof is two petabytes in size and was certified using a formally verified proof checker, demonstrating that any result by satisfiability solvers---no matter how large---can now be validated using highly trustworthy systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Marijn J.
