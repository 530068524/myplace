However, in order to be practically applicable, it must be able to cater for soft and hard real-world constraints and should, ideally, report a test priority order that maximises earliest fault detection. We show that we can achieve the highest strength CIT in 5.65 minutes on average. This was previously thought to be too computationally expensive to be feasible. Furthermore, we show that higher strength suites find more faults, while prioritisations using lower strengths are no worse at achieving early fault revelation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "University College London"], "authors": ["Justyna Petke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petke:Justyna", "Shin Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Shin", "Myra B.
