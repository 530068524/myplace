{"title": "Human Action Recognition Using a Temporal Hierarchy of Covariance Descriptors on 3D Joint Locations.", "fields": ["motion capture", "multimedia information retrieval", "discriminative model", "annotation", "covariance"], "abstract": "Human action recognition from videos is a challenging machine vision task with multiple important application domains, such as human-robot/machine interaction, interactive entertainment, multimedia information retrieval, and surveillance. In this paper, we present a novel approach to human action recognition from 3D skeleton sequences extracted from depth data. We use the covariance matrix for skeleton joint locations over time as a discriminative descriptor for a sequence. To encode the relationship between joint movement and time, we deploy multiple covariance matrices over sub-sequences in a hierarchical fashion. The descriptor has a fixed length that is independent from the length of the described sequence. Our experiments show that using the covariance descriptor with an off-the-shelf classification algorithm outperforms the state of the art in action recognition on multiple datasets, captured either via a Kinect-type sensor or a sophisticated motion capture system. We also include an evaluation on a novel large dataset using our own annotation.", "citation": "Citations (279)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Alexandria University", "Alexandria University", "Alexandria University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Mohamed E.
