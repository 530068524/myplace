(SIGMOD '04) for allowing efficient range queries on encrypted data. Interestingly, we first show that a straightforward relaxation of standard security notions for encryption such as indistinguishability against chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) is unachievable by a practical OPE scheme. Instead, we propose a security notion in the spirit of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and related primitives asking that an OPE scheme look \"as-random-as-possible\" subject to the order-preserving constraint. We then design an efficient OPE scheme and prove its security under our notion based on pseudorandomness of an underlying blockcipher. Our construction is based on a natural relation we uncover between a random order-preserving function and the hypergeometric probability distribution. In particular, it makes black-box use of an efficient sampling algorithm for the latter.", "citation": "Citations (757)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Alexandra Boldyreva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boldyreva:Alexandra", "Nathan Chenette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chenette:Nathan", "Younho Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Younho", "Adam O'Neill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Neill:Adam"], "pages": 18}
