This task presents a number of challenges, including the scarcity of labeled data and the difficulties in finding the relevant portions of the text. We investigate the use of annotator rationales to overcome these challenges, proposing several new ways of utilizing rationales and showing that through judicious use of the rationales, it is possible to achieve significant improvement over a unigram SVM baseline.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Muhammad Arshad Ul Abedin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abedin:Muhammad_Arshad_Ul", "Vincent Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Vincent", "Latifur Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Latifur"], "pages": 6}
