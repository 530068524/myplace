{"title": "Multi-query Stream Processing on FPGAs.", "fields": ["stream processing", "pipeline", "reconfigurable computing", "event stream processing", "complex event processing"], "abstract": "We present an efficient multi-query event stream platform to support query processing over high-frequency event streams. Our platform is built over reconfigurable hardware -- FPGAs -- to achieve line-rate multi-query processing by exploiting unprecedented degrees of parallelism and potential for pipelining, only available through custom-built, application-specific and low-level logic design. Moreover, a multi-query event stream processing engine is at the core of a wide range of applications including real-time data analytics, algorithmic trading, targeted advertisement, and (complex) event processing.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Mohammad Sadoghi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadoghi:Mohammad", "Rija Javed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Javed:Rija", "Naif Tarafdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarafdar:Naif", "Harsh Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Harsh", "Rohan Palaniappan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palaniappan:Rohan", "Hans-Arno Jacobsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobsen:Hans=Arno"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
