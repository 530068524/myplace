{"title": "CERN: Confidence-Energy Recurrent Network for Group Activity Recognition.", "fields": ["large hadron collider", "training set", "softmax function", "activity recognition", "hierarchy"], "abstract": "This work is about recognizing human activities occurring in videos at distinct semantic levels, including individual actions, interactions, and group activities. The recognition is realized using a two-level hierarchy of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, forming a feed-forward deep architecture, which can be trained end-to-end. In comparison with existing architectures of LSTMs, we make two key contributions giving the name to our approach as Confidence-Energy Recurrent Network \u2013 CERN. First, instead of using the common softmax layer for prediction, we specify a novel energy layer (EL) for estimating the energy of our predictions. Second, rather than finding the common minimum-energy class assignment, which may be numerically unstable under uncertainty, we specify that the EL additionally computes the p-values of the solutions, and in this way estimates the most confident energy minimum. The evaluation on the Collective Activity and Volleyball datasets demonstrates: (i) advantages of our two contributions relative to the common softmax and energy-minimization formulations and (ii) a superior performance relative to the state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Oregon State University", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tianmin Shu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shu:Tianmin", "Sinisa Todorovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Todorovic:Sinisa", "Song-Chun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Song=Chun"], "pages": 9}
