In this paper, we present a novel graph embedding method called \"AnnexML\". At the training step, AnnexML constructs a  k -nearest neighbor graph of label vectors and attempts to reproduce the graph structure in the embedding space. The prediction is efficiently performed by using an approximate nearest neighbor search method that efficiently explores the learned  k -nearest neighbor graph in the embedding space. We conducted evaluations on several large-scale real-world data sets and compared our method with recent state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that our AnnexML can significantly improve prediction accuracy, especially on data sets that have larger a label space. In addition, AnnexML improves the trade-off between prediction time and accuracy. At the same level of accuracy, the prediction time of AnnexML was up to 58 times faster than that of SLEEC, which is a state-of-the-art embedding-based method.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Kyoto University"], "authors": ["Yukihiro Tagami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tagami:Yukihiro"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
