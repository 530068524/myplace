{"title": "GROPG: a graphical on-phone debugger.", "fields": ["debugging", "android", "background debug mode interface", "debugger", "algorithmic program debugging"], "abstract": "Debugging mobile phone applications is hard, as current debugging techniques either require multiple computing devices or do not support graphical debugging. To address this problem we present GROPG, the first graphical on-phone debugger. We implement GROPG for Android and perform a preliminary evaluation on third-party applications. Our experiments suggest that GROPG can lower the overall debugging time of a comparable text-based on-phone debugger by up to 2/3.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Tuan Anh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Tuan_Anh", "Christoph Csallner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Csallner:Christoph", "Nikolai Tillmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tillmann:Nikolai"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
