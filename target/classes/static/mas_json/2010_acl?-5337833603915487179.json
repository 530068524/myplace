We make use of the collocation probabilities, which are estimated from monolingual corpora, in two aspects, namely improving word alignment for various kinds of SMT systems and improving phrase table for phrase-based SMT. The experimental results show that our method improves the performance of both word alignment and translation quality significantly. As compared to baseline systems, we achieve absolute improvements of 2.40 BLEU score on a phrase-based SMT system and 1.76 BLEU score on a parsing-based SMT system.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Baidu", "Baidu", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhanyi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhanyi", "Haifeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haifeng", "Hua Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0003:Hua", "Sheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Sheng"], "pages": 9}
