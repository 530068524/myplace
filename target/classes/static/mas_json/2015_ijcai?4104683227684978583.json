{"title": "Verifying Emergent Properties of Swarms.", "fields": ["mathematics", "swarm behaviour", "decision problem", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We investigate the general problem of establishing whether a swarm satisfies an emergent property. We put forward a formal model for swarms that accounts for their nature of unbounded collections of agents following simple local protocols. We formally define the decision problem of determining whether a swarm satisfies an emergent property. We introduce a sound and complete procedure for solving the problem. We illustrate the technique by applying it to the Beta aggregation algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Panagiotis Kouvaros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kouvaros:Panagiotis", "Alessio Lomuscio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lomuscio:Alessio"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
