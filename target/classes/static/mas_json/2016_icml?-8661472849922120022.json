{"title": "How to Fake Multiply by a Gaussian Matrix.", "fields": ["total variation", "non negative matrix factorization", "gaussian", "probability of error", "matrix"], "abstract": "Have you ever wanted to multiply an n \u00d7 d matrix X, with n \u226b d, on the left by an m \u00d7 n matrix G of i.i.d. Gaussian random variables, but could not afford to do it because it was too slow? In this work we propose a new randomized m \u00d7 n matrix T, for which one can compute T \u010b X in only O(nnz(X)) + O(m1.5 \u010b d3) time, for which the total variation distance between the distributions T \u010b X and G \u010b X is as small as desired, i.e., less than any positive constant. Here nnz(X) denotes the number of non-zero entries of X. Assuming nnz(X) \u226b m1.5 \u010b d3, this is a significant savings over the naive O(nnz(X)m) time to compute G \u010b X Moreover, since the total variation distance is small, we can provably use T \u010b X in place of G \u010b X in any application and have the same guarantees as if we were using G \u010b X, up to a small positive constant in error probability. We apply this transform to nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and support vector machines (SVM).", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "IBM", "Comcast Cable, Washington, DC"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Michael Kapralov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapralov:Michael", "Vamsi K.
