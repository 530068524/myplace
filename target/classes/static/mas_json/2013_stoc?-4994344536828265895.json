{"title": "Sparsest cut on bounded treewidth graphs: algorithms and hardness results.", "fields": ["1 planar graph", "unique games conjecture", "treewidth", "partial k tree", "bounded function"], "abstract": "We give a 2-approximation algorithm for the non-uniform Sparsest Cut problem that runs in time n O(k) , where k is the treewidth of the graph. This improves on the previous 2 2 k  -approximation in time poly(n) 2 O(k)  due to Chlamtac et al. [18].   To complement this algorithm, we show the following hardness results: If the non-uniform Sparsest Cut has a \u03c1-approximation for series-parallel graphs (where \u03c1 \u2265 1), then the MaxCut problem has an algorithm with approximation factor arbitrarily close to 1/\u03c1. Hence, even for such restricted graphs (which have treewidth 2), the Sparsest Cut problem is NP-hard to approximate better than 17/16 - e for e > 0; assuming the Unique Games Conjecture the hardness becomes 1/\u03b1 GW  - e. For graphs with large (but constant) treewidth, we show a hardness result of 2 - e assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.   Our algorithm rounds a linear program based on (a subset of) the Sherali-Adams lift of the standard Sparsest Cut LP. We show that even for treewidth-2 graphs, the LP has an integrality gap close to 2 even after polynomially many rounds of Sherali-Adams. Hence our approach cannot be improved even on such restricted graphs without using a stronger relaxation.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anupam Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Anupam", "Kunal Talwar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talwar:Kunal", "David Witmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Witmer:David"], "pages": 10}
