{"title": "Trustworthy by design.", "fields": ["mobile device", "data collection", "mobile computing", "trustworthiness", "usability"], "abstract": "Driven by changes in working practices and technology trends, organizations are increasingly reliant on mobile workers and the data they capture. However, while significant work has been carried out on increasing the usability of mobile devices and applications, little attention has been paid to the quality of data captured by mobile workers. If this data is inaccurate or untrustworthy, serious consequences can ensue. In this paper we study a system targeted at mobile workers in the highways sector that is deliberately designed to increase the accuracy and trustworthiness of the data collected. The resulting Inspections application has been very positively received by workers and we present lessons that we believe can be applied to other applications of this type.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "InTouch Ltd., M ...
