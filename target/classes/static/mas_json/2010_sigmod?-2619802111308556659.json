The GRN modeling framework is capable of representing a much wider range of tuple dependency structure. We show that a GRN representation of a probabilistic database may undergo transitions induced by imposing constraints or evaluating queries. We formalize procedures for these two types of transitions such that the resulting graphical models after transitions remain as GRNs. This formalism makes GRN a self-contained modeling framework and a closed representation system for probabilistic databases - a property that is lacking in most existing models. In addition, we show that exploiting the transitional mechanisms allows a systematic approach to constructing GRNs for arbitrary probabilistic data at arbitrary stages. Advantages of GRNs in query evaluation are also demonstrated.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "School of Informatics"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ruiwen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ruiwen", "Yongyi Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Yongyi", "Iluju Kiringa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiringa:Iluju"], "pages": 12}
