{"title": "Precise Concurrent Zero Knowledge.", "fields": ["commitment scheme", "quadratic equation", "zero knowledge proof", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Precise zero knowledge introduced by Micali and Pass (STOC'06) guarantees that the view of any verifier V can be simulated in time closely related to the actual (as opposed to worst-case) time spent by V in the generated view. We provide the first constructions of precise concurrent zero-knowledge protocols. Our constructions have essentially optimal precision; consequently this improves also upon the previously tightest non-precise concurrent zero-knowledge protocols by Kilian and Petrank (STOC'01) and Prabhakaran, Rosen and Sahai (FOCS'02) whose simulators have a quadratic worst-case overhead. Additionally, we achieve a statistically-precise concurrent zero-knowledge property-which requires simulation of unbounded verifiers participating in an unbounded number of concurrent executions; as such we obtain the first (even non-precise) concurrent zero-knowledge protocols which handle verifiers participating in a super-polynomial number of concurrent executions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Cornell University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Omkant Pandey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandey:Omkant", "Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit", "Wei-Lung Dustin Tseng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tseng:Wei=Lung_Dustin", "Muthuramakrishnan Venkitasubramaniam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkitasubramaniam:Muthuramakrishnan"], "pages": 18}
