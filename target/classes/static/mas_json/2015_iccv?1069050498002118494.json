{"title": "Training a Feedback Loop for Hand Pose Estimation.", "fields": ["theano", "training set", "pose", "convolutional neural network", "cuda"], "abstract": "We propose an entirely data-driven approach to estimating the 3D pose of a hand given a depth image. We show that we can correct the mistakes made by a Convolutional Neural Network trained to predict an estimate of the 3D pose by using a feedback loop. The components of this feedback loop are also Deep Networks, optimized using training data. They remove the need for fitting a 3D model to the input data, which requires both a carefully designed fitting function and algorithm. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and is efficient as our implementation runs at over 400 fps on a single GPU.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Markus Oberweger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oberweger:Markus", "Paul Wohlhart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wohlhart:Paul", "Vincent Lepetit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepetit:Vincent"], "pages": 9}
