Omnipedia highlights the similarities and differences that exist among Wikipedia language editions, and makes salient information that is unique to each language as well as that which is shared more widely. We detail solutions to numerous front-end and algorithmic challenges inherent to providing users with a multilingual Wikipedia experience. These include visualizing content in a language-neutral way and aligning data in the face of diverse information organization strategies. We present a study of Omnipedia that characterizes how people interact with information using a multilingual lens. We found that users actively sought information exclusive to unfamiliar language editions and strategically compared how language editions defined concepts. Finally, we briefly discuss how Omnipedia generalizes to other domains facing language barriers.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Patti Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Patti", "Brent J.
