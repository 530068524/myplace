{"title": "Mining smartphone data to classify life-facets of social relationships.", "fields": ["mobile social network", "human computer interaction", "call duration", "channel", "social network"], "abstract": "People engage with many overlapping social networks and enact diverse social roles across different facets of their lives. Unfortunately, many online social networking services reduce most people's contacts to \"friend\". A richer computational model of relationships would be useful for a number of applications such as managing privacy settings and organizing communications. In this paper, we take a step towards a richer computational model by using call and text message logs from mobile phones to classifying contacts according to life facet ( family, work , and  social ). We extract various features such as communication intensity, regularity, medium, and temporal tendency, and classify the relationships using machine-learning techniques. Our experimental results on 40 users showed that we could classify life facets with up to 90.5% accuracy. The most relevant features include call duration, channel selection, and time of day for the communication.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Jun-Ki Min.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Min:Jun=Ki", "Jason Wiese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiese:Jason", "Jason I.
