Our model proceeds on a per-frame basis, guided by the output of the previous frame towards the object of interest in the next frame. We demonstrate that highly accurate object segmentation in videos can be enabled by using a convolutional neural network (convnet) trained with static images only. The key component of our approach is a combination of offline and online learning strategies, where the former produces a refined mask from the previous frame estimate and the latter allows to capture the appearance of the specific object instance. Our method can handle different types of input annotations such as bounding boxes and segments while leveraging an arbitrary amount of annotated frames. Therefore our system is suitable for diverse applications with different requirements in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In our extensive evaluation, we obtain competitive results on three different datasets, independently from the type of input annotation.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Federico Perazzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perazzi:Federico", "Anna Khoreva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khoreva:Anna", "Rodrigo Benenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benenson:Rodrigo", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt", "Alexander Sorkine-Hornung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sorkine=Hornung:Alexander"], "pages": 10}
