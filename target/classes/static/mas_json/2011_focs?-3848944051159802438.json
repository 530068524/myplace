We present a parallel algorithm, which given an instance of a positive semi definite program of size N and an approximation factor e >, 0, runs in (parallel) time poly(1/e) polylog(N), using poly(N) processors, and outputs a value which is within multiplicative factor of (1+ e) to the optimal. Our result generalizes analogous result of Luby and Nisan (1993) for positive linear programs and our algorithm is inspired by their algorithm of [10].", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Rahul Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain_0001:Rahul", "Penghui Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Penghui"], "pages": 9}
