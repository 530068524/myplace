As a consequence, such tools cannot guarantee suitable coverage of test cases commonly required for database testing. In this paper, we investigate the problem of generating queries that satisfy cardinality constraints on intermediate subexpressions when executed on a given test database. Such queries are required to test the performance of a database system under different operating conditions.   We formally analyze this problem, quantify its difficulty and follow up this analysis with a description of a practical algorithm which utilizes sampling and space pruning techniques to quickly generate test queries that have desired properties. We present the results of an experimental evaluation of our approach as implemented in an open source data manager, demonstrating the utility of our proposal.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "IBM"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Chaitanya Mishra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mishra:Chaitanya", "Nick Koudas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koudas:Nick", "Calisto Zuzarte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuzarte:Calisto"], "pages": 12}
