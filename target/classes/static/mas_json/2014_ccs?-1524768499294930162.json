We introduce the design and implementation of Address Translation Redirection Attack (ATRA) that enables complete evasion of the hardware-based external monitor that anchors its trust on a separate processor. ATRA circumvents the external monitor by redirecting the memory access to critical kernel objects into a non-monitored region. Despite the seriousness of the ATRA issue, the address translation integrity has been assumed in many hardware-based external monitors and the possibility of its exploitation has been suggested yet many considered hypothetical. We explore the intricate details of ATRA, explain major challenges in realizing ATRA in practice, and address them with two types of ATRA called Memory-bound ATRA and Register-bound ATRA. Our evaluations with benchmarks show that ATRA does not introduce a noticeable performance degradation to the host system, proving practical applicability of the attack to alert the researchers to seriously address ATRA in designing future external monitors.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["DaeHee Jang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jang:DaeHee", "Hojoon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hojoon", "Minsu Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Minsu", "Daehyeok Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Daehyeok", "Daegyeong Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Daegyeong", "Brent ByungHoon Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Brent_ByungHoon"], "pages": 12}
