The main contributions are new feasibility tests to integrate the hand-eye calibration problem into a branch-and-bound parameter space search. The presented method constitutes the first guaranteed globally optimal estimator for simultaneous optimization of both components with respect to a cost function based on reprojection errors. The system is evaluated in both synthetic and real world scenarios. The employed benchmark dataset is published online 1  to create a common point of reference for evaluation of hand-eye self-calibration algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Ulm", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Daimler AG"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Thomas Ruland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruland:Thomas", "Tom\u00e1s Pajdla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pajdla:Tom=aacute=s", "Lars Kr\u00fcger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=uuml=ger:Lars"], "pages": 8}
