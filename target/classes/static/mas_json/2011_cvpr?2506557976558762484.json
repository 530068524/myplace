{"title": "Space-time super-resolution from a single video.", "fields": ["superresolution", "aliasing", "phenomenon", "motion blur", "pixel"], "abstract": "Spatial Super Resolution (SR) aims to recover fine image details, smaller than a pixel size. Temporal SR aims to recover rapid dynamic events that occur faster than the video frame-rate, and are therefore invisible or seen incorrectly in the video sequence. Previous methods for Space-Time SR combined information from multiple video recordings of the same dynamic scene. In this paper we show how this can be done from a single video recording. Our approach is based on the observation that small space-time patches (\u2018ST-patches\u2019, e.g., 5\u00d75\u00d73) of a single \u2018natural video\u2019, recur many times inside the same video sequence at multiple spatio-temporal scales. We statistically explore the degree of these ST-patch recurrences inside \u2018natural videos\u2019, and show that this is a very strong statistical phenomenon. Space-time SR is obtained by combining information from multiple ST-patches at sub-frame accuracy. We show how finding similar ST-patches can be done both efficiently (with a randomized-based search in space-time), and at sub-frame accuracy (despite severe motion aliasing). Our approach is particularly useful for temporal SR, resolving both severe motion aliasing and severe motion blur in complex \u2018natural videos\u2019.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Oded Shahar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shahar:Oded", "Alon Faktor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faktor:Alon", "Michal Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Michal"], "pages": 8}
