The model is defined as a factored three-way Boltzmann machine, in which hidden variables collaborate to define the joint correlation matrix for image pairs. Modeling the joint distribution over pairs makes it possible to efficiently match images that are the same according to a learned measure of similarity. We apply the model to several face matching tasks, and show that it learns to represent the input images using task-specific basis functions. Matching performance is superior to previous similar generative models, including recent conditional models of transformations. We also show that the model can be used as a plug-in matching score to perform invariant classification.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of Toronto", "Goethe University Frankfurt", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Joshua M.
