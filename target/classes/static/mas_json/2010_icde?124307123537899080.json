In most real-world situations, however, there may exist multiple cost types involved in transportation decision making. For example, the different costs of a road segment could be its Euclidean length, the driving time, the walking time, possible toll fee, etc. The relative significance of these cost types may vary from user to user. In this paper we consider such multi-cost transportation networks (MCN), where each edge (road segment) is associated with multiple cost values. We formulate skyline and top-k queries in MCNs and design algorithms for their efficient processing. Our solutions have two important properties in preference-based querying; the skyline methods are progressive and the top-k ones are incremental. The performance of our techniques is evaluated with experiments on a real road network.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Kyriakos Mouratidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mouratidis:Kyriakos", "Yimin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Yimin", "Man Lung Yiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yiu:Man_Lung"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
