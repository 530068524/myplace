{"title": "Large Graph Construction for Scalable Semi-Supervised Learning.", "fields": ["strength of a graph", "graph bandwidth", "graph energy", "null graph", "adjacency matrix"], "abstract": "In this paper, we address the scalability issue plaguing graph-based semi-supervised learning via a small number of anchor points which adequately cover the entire point cloud. Critically, these anchor points enable nonparametric regression that predicts the label for each data point as a locally weighted average of the labels on anchor points. Because conventional graph construction is inefficient in large scale, we propose to construct a tractable large graph by coupling anchor-based label prediction and adjacency matrix design. Contrary to the Nystrom approximation of adjacency matrices which results in indefinite graph Laplacians and in turn leads to potential non-convex optimization over graphs, the proposed graph construction approach based on a unique idea called AnchorGraph provides nonnegative adjacency matrices to guarantee positive semidefinite graph Laplacians. Our approach scales linearly with the data size and in practice usually produces a large sparse graph. Experiments on large datasets demonstrate the significant accuracy improvement and scalability of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (359)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Wei", "Junfeng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Junfeng", "Shih-Fu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Shih=Fu"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
