This seems to be the first type-preserving store-passing translation for general references. It can be viewed as a purely syntactic account of a possible worlds model.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Pottier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pottier:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
