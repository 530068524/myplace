But HTML pages still contain large amounts of \"design scaffolding\" needed to hierarchically layer content for proper presentation. This paper presents Cascading Tree Sheets (CTS), a CSS-like language for separating this presentational HTML from real content. With CTS, authors can use standard CSS selectors to describe how to graft presentational scaffolding onto their pure-content HTML. This improved separation of content from presentation enables even naive authors to incorporate rich layouts (including interactive Javascript) into their own pages simply by linking to a  tree sheet  and adding some class names to their HTML.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Edward Benson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benson:Edward", "David R.
