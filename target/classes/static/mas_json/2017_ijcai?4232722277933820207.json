{"title": "Dynamical System-Based Motion Planning for Multi-Arm Systems: Reaching for Moving Objects.", "fields": ["dynamical system", "lyapunov stability", "motion planning", "dynamical systems theory", "virtual image"], "abstract": "The use of coordinated multi-arm robotic systems allows to preform manipulations of heavy or bulky objects that would otherwise be infeasible for a single-arm robot. This paper concisely introduces our work on coordinated multi-arm control [Salehian et al., 2016a], where we proposed a virtual object based dynamical systems (DS) control law to generate autonomous and synchronized motions for a multi-arm robot system. We show theoretically and empirically that the multi-arm + virtual object system converges asymptotically to a moving object. The proposed framework is validated on a dual-arm robotic system. We demonstrate that it can resynchronize and adapt the motion of each arm in a fraction of a second, even when the object\u2019s motion is fast and not accurately predictable.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Seyed Sina Mirrazavi Salehian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salehian:Seyed_Sina_Mirrazavi", "Nadia Figueroa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Figueroa:Nadia", "Aude Billard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Billard:Aude"], "pages": 5}
