{"title": "A Machine Learning Approach to Musically Meaningful Homogeneous Style Classification.", "fields": ["homogeneous", "classical music", "elements of music", "interpretability", "discriminative model"], "abstract": "Recent literature has demonstrated the difficulty of classifying between composers who write in extremely similar styles (homogeneous style). Additionally, machine learning studies in this field have been exclusively of technical import with little musicological interpretability or significance. We present a supervised machine learning system which addresses the difficulty of differentiating between stylistically homogeneous composers using foundational elements of music, their complexity and interaction. Our work expands on previous style classification studies by developing more complex features as well as introducing a new class of musical features which focus on local irregularities within musical scores. We demonstrate the discriminative power of the system as applied to Haydn and Mozart's string quartets. Our results yield interpretable musicological conclusions about Haydn's and Mozart's stylistic differences while distinguishing between the composers with higher accuracy than previous studies in this domain.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of Pennsylvania", "Bar-Ilan University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["William Herlands.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herlands:William", "Ricky Der.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Der:Ricky", "Yoel Greenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenberg:Yoel", "Simon A.
