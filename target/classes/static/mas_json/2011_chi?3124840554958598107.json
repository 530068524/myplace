We studied aiming to a target in four tasks requiring varying precision after acquisition. Our results present the first evidence that the intended use of a target affects its acquisition in terms of movement time and motion kinematics for computer aiming. Important for researchers who model 2D targeting, our results also have particular impact for HCI research that uses motion kinematics.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Regan L.
