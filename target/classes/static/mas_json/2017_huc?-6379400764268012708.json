Presently, in the Information era, our cognitive capacities cannot simply rely on natural evolution to keep up with the immense advancements in the field of Ubiquitous technologies, which remain largely uninformed about our cognitive states. As a result, a so-called \"cognitive gap\" is forming between the human (users) and the machine (systems) preventing us from fully harnessing the benefits of modern technologies. We argue that a \"cognitive information layer\", placed in-between human and machine, could bridge that gap, informing the machine side about aspects of our cognition in real time (e.g., attention levels). In this position paper, we present our vision for such a software architecture, we describe how it could serve as a framework for designing and developing cognition-aware applications, and we showcase some application scenarios as a roadmap towards human-machine convergence and symbiosis.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano", "Universidade da ... nchal, Portugal"], "authors": ["Evangelos Niforatos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niforatos:Evangelos", "Athanasios Vourvopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vourvopoulos:Athanasios", "Marc Langheinrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langheinrich:Marc"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
