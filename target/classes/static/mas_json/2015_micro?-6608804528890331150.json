Once the interposer has been paid for, there are new opportunities to exploit the interposer. Recent work considers using the routing resources of the interposer to improve the network-on-chip's (NoC) capabilities. In this work, we exploit the interposer to \"disintegrate\" a multi-core CPU chip into smaller chips that individually and collectively cost less to manufacture than a single large chip. However, this fragments the overall NoC, which decreases performance as core-to-core messages between chips must now route through the interposer. We study the performance-cost trade-offs of interposer based, multi-chip, multi-core systems and propose new interposer NoC organizations to mitigate the performance challenges while preserving the cost benefits.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Advanced Micro Devices"], "authors": ["Ajaykumar Kannan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kannan:Ajaykumar", "Natalie D.
