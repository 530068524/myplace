{"title": "Graph-based Dependency Parsing with Bidirectional LSTM.", "fields": ["treebank", "factorization", "embedding", "dependency grammar", "sentence"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a neural network model for graph-based dependency parsing which utilizes Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) to capture richer contextual information instead of using high-order factorization, and enable our model to use much fewer features than previous work. In addition, we propose an effective way to learn sentence segment embedding on sentence-level based on an extra forward LSTM network. Although our model uses only first-order factorization, experiments on English Peen Treebank and Chinese Penn Treebank show that our model could be competitive with previous higher-order graph-based dependency parsing models and state-of-the-art models.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Wenhui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wenhui", "Baobao Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Baobao"], "pages": -1}
