This analysis has a dual purpose. Firstly, the properties of the bound on localization error may help to design efficient localization algorithm. For example, utilizing one of the properties, we propose a way to define weights for a weighted K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) scheme which is shown to perform better than the K-NN algorithm. Secondly, it provides suggestions for a positioning system design by revealing error trends associated with the system deployment. In both cases, detailed analysis as well as experimental results are presented in order to support our claims.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["A.
