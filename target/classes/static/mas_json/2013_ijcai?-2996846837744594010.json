{"title": "Kemeny Elections with Bounded Single-Peaked or Single-Crossing Width.", "fields": ["bounded function", "time complexity", "voting", "data structure", "computational social choice"], "abstract": "This paper is devoted to complexity results regarding specific measures of proximity to single-peakedness and single-crossingness, called \"single-peaked width\" [Cornaz et al., 2012] and \"single-crossing width\". Thanks to the use of the PQ-tree data structure [Booth and Lueker, 1976], we show that both problems are polynomial time solvable in the general case (while it was only known for single-peaked width and in the case of narcissistic preferences). Furthermore, we establish one of the first results (to our knowledge) concerning the effect of nearly single-peaked electorates on the complexity of an NP-hard voting system, namely we show the fixed-parameter tractability of Kemeny elections with respect to the parameters \"single-peaked width\" and \"single-crossing width\".", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Paris Dauphine University", "Paris Dauphine University", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Denis Cornaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cornaz:Denis", "Lucie Galand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galand:Lucie", "Olivier Spanjaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spanjaard:Olivier"], "pages": 7}
