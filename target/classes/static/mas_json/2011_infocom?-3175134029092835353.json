However, a critical downside of SRW - slow diffusion or exploration over the space, typically leads to longer packet delay and undermines its own benefits. Such slow-mixing problem becomes even worse under random duty cycling adopted for energy conservation. In this paper, we study how to overcome this problem without any sacrifice or tradeoff, and propose a simple modification of random duty cycling, named Smart Sleep, which achieves more power-saving as well as faster packet diffusion (or smaller delay) while retaining the benefits of SRW. We also introduce a class of p-backtracking random walks and establish its properties to analytically explain the fast packet diffusion induced by Smart Sleep. We further obtain a necessary condition to achieve an optimal performance under our Smart Sleep, and finally demonstrate remarkable performance improvement via independent simulation results over various network topologies.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Chul-Ho Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chul=Ho", "Do Young Eun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eun:Do_Young"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
