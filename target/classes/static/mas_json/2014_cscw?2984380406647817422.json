{"title": "Deep Twitter diving: exploring topical groups in microblogs at scale.", "fields": ["social media", "multimedia", "microblogging", "ranging", "computer science"], "abstract": "We present a semantic methodology to identify topical groups in Twitter on a large number of topics, each consisting of users who are experts on or interested in a specific topic. Early studies investigating the nature of Twitter suggest that it is a social media platform consisting of a relatively small section of elite users, producing information on a few popular topics such as media, politics, and music, and the general population consuming it. We show that this characterization ignores a rich set of highly specialized topics, ranging from geology, neurology, to astrophysics and karate - each being discussed by their own topical groups. We present a detailed characterization of these topical groups based on their network structures and tweeting behaviors. Analyzing these groups on the backdrop of the common identity and bond theory in social sciences shows that these groups exhibit characteristics of topical-identity based groups, rather than social-bond based ones.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Parantapa Bhattacharya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhattacharya:Parantapa", "Saptarshi Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Saptarshi", "Juhi Kulshrestha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulshrestha:Juhi", "Mainack Mondal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mondal:Mainack", "Muhammad Bilal Zafar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zafar:Muhammad_Bilal", "Niloy Ganguly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganguly:Niloy", "Krishna P.
