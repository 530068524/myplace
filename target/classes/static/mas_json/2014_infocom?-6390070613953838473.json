The former work about correlated mobility has shown the maximum throughput and the corresponding delay of several sub-cases, but the optimal throughput performances under various delay tolerant condition (the optimal delay-throughput tradeoff) remains open. We study the properties of correlated mobility model and establish the upper bound of delay-throughput tradeoff for several sub-cases. Then we find out an achievable lower bound by studying the optimal scheduling parameters and their constrains. We exploit the node correlation to achieve the delay-throughput tradeoff and give a picture that how node correlation impacts the packet delay, asymptotic throughput, and their tradeoff.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Shuochao Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Shuochao", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing", "Xiaohua Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Xiaohua", "Qian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
