We propose exact inference and sampling methodologies for two specific cases where the discontinuous dynamics is given by a Poisson process and a two-state Markovian switch. We test the methodology on simulated data, and apply it to two real data sets in finance and systems biology. Our experimental results show that the approach leads to valid inferences and non-trivial insights.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "School of Informatics"], "authors": ["Florian Stimberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stimberg:Florian", "Manfred Opper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Opper:Manfred", "Guido Sanguinetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanguinetti:Guido", "Andreas Ruttor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruttor:Andreas"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
