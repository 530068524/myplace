{"title": "Engineering inhibitory proteins with InSiPS: the in-silico protein synthesizer.", "fields": ["synthetic biology", "protein sequencing", "protein design", "target protein", "inhibitory postsynaptic potential"], "abstract": "Engineered proteins  are synthetic novel proteins (not found in nature) that are designed to fulfill a predetermined biological function. Such proteins can be used as molecular markers, inhibitory agents, or drugs. For example, a synthetic protein could bind to a critical protein of a pathogen, thereby inhibiting the function of the target protein and potentially reducing the impact of the pathogen. In this paper we present the  In-Silico Protein Synthesizer (InSiPS) , a massively parallel computational tool for the IBM Blue Gene/Q that is aimed at designing inhibitory proteins. More precisely, InSiPS designs proteins that are predicted to interact with a given target protein (and may inhibit the target's cellular functions) while leaving non-target proteins unaffected (to minimize side-effects). As proof-of-concepts, two InSiPS designed proteins have been synthesized in the lab and their inhibitory properties have been experimentally verified through wet-lab experimentation.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carleton University", "Carleton University", "Carleton University", "Carleton University", "Carleton University"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Andrew Schoenrock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schoenrock:Andrew", "Daniel J.
