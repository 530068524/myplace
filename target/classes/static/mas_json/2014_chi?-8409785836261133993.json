{"title": "Kickables: tangibles for feet.", "fields": ["foot", "human computer interaction", "multimedia", "affordance", "modalities"], "abstract": "We introduce the concept of tangibles that users can manipulate with their feet. We call them kickables. Unlike traditional tangibles, kickables allow for very large interaction surfaces as  kickables  reside on the ground. The main benefit of kickables over other foot-based modalities, such as foot touch, is their strong affordance, which we validate in two user studies. This affordance makes kickables well-suited for walk-up installations, such as tradeshows or museum exhibits.   We present a custom design as well as five families of standard kickables to help application designers create kickable applications faster. Each family supports multiple standard controls, such as push buttons, switches, dials, and sliders. Each type explores a different design principle, in particular different mechanical constraints. We demonstrate an implementation on our pressure-sensing floor.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "University of Hasselt", "University of Copenhagen", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dominik Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Dominik", "Raf Ramakers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramakers:Raf", "Esben Warming Pedersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedersen:Esben_Warming", "Johannes Jasper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jasper:Johannes", "Sven K\u00f6hler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=hler_0004:Sven", "Aileen Pohl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pohl:Aileen", "Hannes Rantzsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rantzsch:Hannes", "Andreas Rau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rau:Andreas", "Patrick Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Patrick", "Christoph Sterz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sterz:Christoph", "Yanina Yurchenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yurchenko:Yanina", "Patrick Baudisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baudisch:Patrick"], "pages": 10}
