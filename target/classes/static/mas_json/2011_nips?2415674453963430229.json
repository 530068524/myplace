We first establish that a class of special rank minimization problems has closed-form solutions. Using this result, we then propose penalty decomposition PD methods for general rank minimization problems in which each subproblem is solved by a block coordinate descent method. Under some suitable assumptions, we show that any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the PD methods satisfies the first-order optimality conditions of a nonlinear reformulation of the problems. Finally, we test the performance of our methods by applying them to the matrix completion and nearest low-rank correlation matrix problems. The computational results demonstrate that our methods are generally comparable or superior to the existing methods in terms of solution quality.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yong", "Zhaosong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhaosong"], "pages": 9}
