{"title": "POSEidon: Face-from-Depth for Driver Pose Estimation.", "fields": ["articulated body pose estimation", "deep learning", "pose", "frame rate", "3d pose estimation"], "abstract": "Fast and accurate upper-body and head pose estimation is a key task for automatic monitoring of driver attention, a challenging context characterized by severe illumination changes, occlusions and extreme poses. In this work, we present a new deep learning framework for head localization and pose estimation on depth images. The core of the proposal is a regressive neural network, called POSEidon, which is composed of three independent convolutional nets followed by a fusion layer, specially conceived for understanding the pose by depth. In addition, to recover the intrinsic value of face appearance for understanding head position and orientation, we propose a new Face-from-Depth model for learning image faces from depth. Results in face reconstruction are qualitatively impressive. We test the proposed framework on two public datasets, namely Biwi Kinect Head Pose and ICT-3DHP, and on Pandora, a new challenging dataset mainly inspired by the automotive setup. Results show that our method overcomes all recent state-of-art works, running in real time at more than 30 frames per second.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia", "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Guido Borghi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borghi:Guido", "Marco Venturelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venturelli:Marco", "Roberto Vezzani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vezzani:Roberto", "Rita Cucchiara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cucchiara:Rita"], "pages": 10}
