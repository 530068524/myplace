However, their potential impact on informing and engaging citizens on relevant issues has still been largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that visualizations displayed in public settings are able to increase social awareness and discourse by exposing underlying patterns in data that is submitted by citizens. We thus introduce the design and evaluation of  Reveal-it! , a public, interactive projection that facilitates the comparison of the energy consumptions of individuals and communities. Our in-the-wild deployment in three distinct physical locations provided insights into: 1) how people responded to this form of display in different contexts; 2) how it influenced people's perception and discussion of individual and communal data; and 3) the implications for a public visualization as a tool for increasing awareness and discourse. We conclude by discussing emerging participant behaviors, as well as some challenges involved in facilitating a socially motivated crowd-sourced visualization in the public context.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Pompeu Fabra University", "Pompeu Fabra University", "University of Sydney", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Nina Valkanova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valkanova:Nina", "Sergi Jord\u00e0.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jord=agrave=:Sergi", "Martin Tomitsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomitsch:Martin", "Andrew Vande Moere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moere:Andrew_Vande"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
