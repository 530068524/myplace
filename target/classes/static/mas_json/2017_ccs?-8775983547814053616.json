{"title": "Faulds: A Non-Parametric Iterative Classifier for Internet-Wide OS Fingerprinting.", "fields": ["network delay", "network security", "web server", "packet loss", "ip header"], "abstract": "Recent work in OS fingerprinting has focused on overcoming random distortion in network and user features during Internet-scale SYN scans. These classification techniques work under an assumption that all parameters of the profiled network are known a-priori -- the likelihood of packet loss, the popularity of each OS, the distribution of network delay, and the probability of user modification to each default TCP/IP header value. However, it is currently unclear how to obtain realistic versions of these parameters for the public Internet and/or customize them to a particular network being analyzed. To address this issue, we derive a non-parametric Expectation-Maximization (EM) estimator, which we call  Faulds , for the unknown distributions involved in single-probe OS fingerprinting and demonstrate its significantly higher robustness to noise compared to methods in prior work. We apply Faulds to a new scan of 67M webservers and discuss its findings.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Zain Shamsi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamsi:Zain", "Daren B.
