We write a natural convex relaxation and show that its optimum solution gives a cn approximation of the permanent. We further show that this factor is asymptotically tight by constructing a family of positive semidefinite matrices. We also show that our result implies an approximate version of the permanent-ontop conjecture, which was recently refuted in its original form; we show that the permanent is within a cn factor of the top eigenvalue of the Schur power matrix.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "City College of New York", "University of Washington", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Nima Anari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anari:Nima", "Leonid Gurvits.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurvits:Leonid", "Shayan Oveis Gharan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gharan:Shayan_Oveis", "Amin Saberi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saberi:Amin"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
