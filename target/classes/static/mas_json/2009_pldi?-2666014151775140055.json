{"title": "Programming model for a heterogeneous x86 platform.", "fields": ["functional reactive programming", "reactive programming", "extensible programming", "system programming", "concurrent object oriented programming"], "abstract": "The client computing platform is moving towards a heterogeneous architecture consisting of a combination of cores focused on scalar performance, and a set of throughput-oriented cores. The throughput oriented cores (e.g. a GPU) may be connected over both coherent and non-coherent interconnects, and have different ISAs. This paper describes a programming model for such heterogeneous platforms. We discuss the language constructs, runtime implementation, and the memory model for such a programming environment. We implemented this programming environment in a x86 heterogeneous platform simulator. We ported a number of workloads to our programming environment, and present the performance of our programming environment on these workloads.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Bratin Saha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saha:Bratin", "Xiaocheng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiaocheng", "Hu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hu", "Ying Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Ying", "Shoumeng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shoumeng", "Mohan Rajagopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajagopalan:Mohan", "Jesse Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Jesse", "Peinan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Peinan", "Ronny Ronen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ronen:Ronny", "Avi Mendelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mendelson:Avi"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
