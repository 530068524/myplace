This work studies how Block-Matching and 3D filtering (BM3D), a state-of-the-art denoising algorithm can be implemented to meet the demands of user-interactive (UI) applications. Denoising is the most computationally demanding stage of a CIP taking more than 95% of time on a highly-optimized software implementation [29]. We analyze the performance and energy consumption of optimized software implementations on three commodity platforms and find that their performance is inadequate.   Accordingly, we consider two alternatives: a dedicated accelerator, and running recently proposed Neural Network (NN) based approximations of BM3D [9, 27] on an NN accelerator. We develop  Image DEnoising AcceLerator(IDEAL) , a hardware BM3D accelerator which incorporates the following techniques: 1) a novel software-hardware optimization,  Matches Reuse  (MR), that exploits typical image content to reduce the computations needed by BM3D, 2) prefetching and judicious use of on-chip buffering to minimize execution stalls and off-chip bandwidth consumption, 3) a careful arrangement of specialized computing blocks, and 4) data type precision tuning. Over a dataset of images with resolutions ranging from 8 megapixel (MP) and up to 42MP, IDEAL is 11, 352\u00d7 and 591\u00d7 faster than high-end general-purpose (CPU) and graphics processor (GPU) software implementations with orders of magnitude better energy efficiency. Even when the NN approximations of BM3D are run on the DaDianNao [14] high-end hardware NN accelerator, IDEAL is 5.4\u00d7 faster and 3.95\u00d7 more energy efficient.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Stanford University", "Algolux"], "authors": ["Mostafa Mahmoud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahmoud:Mostafa", "Bojian Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Bojian", "Alberto Delmas Lascorz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lascorz:Alberto_Delmas", "Felix Heide.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heide:Felix", "Jonathan Assouline.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Assouline:Jonathan", "Paul Boucher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boucher:Paul", "Emmanuel Onzon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onzon:Emmanuel", "Andreas Moshovos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moshovos:Andreas"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
