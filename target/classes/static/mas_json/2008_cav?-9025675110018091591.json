We present our fully configurable binary analysis platform  Jakstab , which resolves indirect branches by multiple rounds of disassembly interleaved with dataflow analysis. We demonstrate that this iterative disassembling strategy achieves better results than the state-of-the-art tool IDA Pro.", "citation": "Citations (137)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Johannes Kinder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kinder:Johannes", "Helmut Veith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veith:Helmut"], "pages": 5}
