{"title": "Pliable Rejection Sampling.", "fields": ["sampling", "rejection sampling", "rejection rate", "pattern recognition", "estimator"], "abstract": "Rejection sampling is a technique for sampling from difficult distributions. However, its use is limited due to a high rejection rate. Common adaptive rejection sampling methods either work only for very specific distributions or without performance guarantees. In this paper, we present pliable rejection sampling (PRS), a new approach to rejection sampling, where we learn the sampling proposal using a kernel estimator. Since our method builds on rejection sampling, the samples obtained are with high probability i.i.d. and distributed according to f. Moreover, PRS comes with a guarantee on the number of accepted samples.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Paris-Sud", "Institut f\u00fcr Ma ... tsdam, Germany"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Akram Erraqabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erraqabi:Akram", "Michal Valko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valko:Michal", "Alexandra Carpentier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carpentier:Alexandra", "Odalric-Ambrym Maillard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maillard:Odalric=Ambrym"], "pages": 9}
