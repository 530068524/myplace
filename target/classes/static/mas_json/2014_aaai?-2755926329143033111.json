Under this circumstance, different approaches have been proposed to facilitate multimedia analysis. Several semi-supervised feature selection algorithms have been proposed to exploit both labeled and unlabeled data. However, they are implemented based on graphs, such that they cannot handle large-scale datasets. How to conduct semi-supervised feature selection on large-scale datasets has become a challenging research problem. Moreover, existing multi-label feature selection algorithms rely on eigendecomposition with heavy computational burden, which further prevent current feature selection algorithms from being applied for big data. In this paper, we propose a novel convex semi-supervised multi-label feature selection algorithm, which can be applied to large-scale datasets. We evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm over five benchmark datasets and compare the results with state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised feature selection algorithms as well as baseline using all features. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm consistently achieve superiors performances.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Queensland", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "authors": ["Xiaojun Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Xiaojun", "Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Yi", "Heng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Heng"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
