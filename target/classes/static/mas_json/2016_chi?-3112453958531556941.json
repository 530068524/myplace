{"title": "TimeAware: Leveraging Framing Effects to Enhance Personal Productivity.", "fields": ["framing", "framing effect", "dashboard", "leverage", "self monitoring"], "abstract": "To help people enhance their personal productivity by providing effective feedback, we designed and developed TimeAware, a self-monitoring system for capturing and reflecting on personal computer usage behaviors. TimeAware employs an ambient widget to promote self-awareness and to lower the feedback access burden, and web-based information dashboard to visualize people's detailed computer usage. To examine the effect of framing on individual's productivity, we designed two versions of TimeAware, each with a different framing setting-one emphasizing productive activities (positive framing) and the other emphasizing distracting activities (negative framing), and conducted an eight-week deployment study (N = 24). We found a significant effect of framing on participants' productivity: only participants in the negative framing condition improved their productivity. The ambient widget seemed to help sustain engagement with data and enhance self-awareness. We discuss how to leverage framing effects to help people enhance their productivity, and how to design successful productivity monitoring tool.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Microsoft", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Young-Ho Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Young=Ho", "Jae Ho Jeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeon:Jae_Ho", "Eun Kyoung Choe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choe:Eun_Kyoung", "Bongshin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Bongshin", "KwonHyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:KwonHyun", "Jinwook Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Jinwook"], "pages": 12}
