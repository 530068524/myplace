In this paper, this learning task is cast as combinatorial optimization problem: given a training sample formed by positive and negative feature vectors in the Euclidean space, the goal is to find a discrete linear function that minimizes the cumulative hinge loss of the sample. Since this problem is NP-hard, we examine two simple rounding algorithms that discretize the fractional solution of the problem. Generalization bounds are derived for several classes of binary-weighted linear functions, by analyzing the Rademacher complexity of these classes and by establishing approximation bounds for our rounding algorithms. Our methods are evaluated on both synthetic and real-world data.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University"], "authors": ["Yann Chevaleyre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chevaleyre:Yann", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Koriche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koriche:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Jean-Daniel Zucker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zucker:Jean=Daniel"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
