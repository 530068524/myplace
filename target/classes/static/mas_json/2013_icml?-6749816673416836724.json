As a generalization of belief propagation (BP), expectation propagation (EP) approximates exact Bayesian computation with ecient message passing updates. However, when an approximation family used by EP is far from exact posterior distributions, message passing may lead to poor approximation quality and suer from divergence. To address this issue, we propose an approximate inference method, relaxed expectation propagation (REP), based on a new divergence with al1 penalty. Minimizing this penalized divergence adaptively relaxes EP\u2019s moment matching requirement for message passing. We apply REP to Gaussian process classication and experimental results demonstrate signicant improvement of REP over EP and -divergence based power EP|in terms of algorithmic stability, estimation accuracy and predictive performance. Furthermore, we develop relaxed belief propagation (RBP), a special case of REP, to conduct inference on discrete Markov random elds (MRFs). Our results show improved estimation accuracy of RBP over BP and fractional BP when interactions between MRF nodes are strong.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Yuan Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Yuan", "Yandong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yandong"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
