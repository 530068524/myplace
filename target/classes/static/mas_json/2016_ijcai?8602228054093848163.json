Answering such questions often requires non-trivial inference and knowledge that goes beyond factoid retrieval. Yet, most systems for this task are based on relatively shallow Information Retrieval (IR) and statistical correlation techniques operating on large unstructured corpora. We propose a structured inference system for this task, formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP), that answers natural language questions using a semi-structured knowledge base derived from text, including questions requiring multi-step inference and a combination of multiple facts. On a dataset of real, unseen science questions, our system significantly outperforms (+14%) the best previous attempt at structured reasoning for this task, which used Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). It also improves upon a previous ILP formulation by 17.7%. When combined with unstructured inference methods, the ILP system significantly boosts overall performance (+10%). Finally, we show our approach is substantially more robust to a simple answer perturbation compared to statistical correlation methods.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Allen Institute ... e, Seattle, WA", "Allen Institute ... e, Seattle, WA", "Allen Institute ... e, Seattle, WA", "Allen Institute ... e, Seattle, WA"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Daniel Khashabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khashabi:Daniel", "Tushar Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Tushar", "Ashish Sabharwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabharwal:Ashish", "Peter Clark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clark:Peter", "Oren Etzioni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etzioni:Oren", "Dan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Dan"], "pages": 8}
