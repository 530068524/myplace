MobileFairPlay allows high-level programming of several secure two-party protocols, including protocols for the Millionaire problem, set intersection, etc. All these functions are useful in the context of mobile social networks and opportunistic networks, where parties are often requested to exchange sensitive information (list of contacts, interest profiles, etc.) to optimise network operation.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["IIT - CNR, Pisa, Italy", "IIT - CNR, Pisa, Italy", "IIT - CNR, Pisa, Italy", "IIT - CNR, Pisa, Italy", "IIT-CNR, Pisa, Italy", "IIT-CNR, Pisa, Italy", "IIT-CNR, Pisa, Italy", "IIT-CNR, Pisa, Italy"], "authors": ["Gianpiero Costantino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costantino:Gianpiero", "Fabio Martinelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martinelli:Fabio", "Paolo Santi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santi:Paolo", "Dario Amoruso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amoruso:Dario"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
