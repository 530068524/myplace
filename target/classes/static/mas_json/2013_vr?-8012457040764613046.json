In sports, social relationships are an important source of stimulus to achieve a goal. Better performances can be achieved when one compete against others, as well as when a group collaborate to achieve a common target. In this work we propose a motivational system to help people to perform better in exergames using a virtual environment and testing the effects of collaboration and competition in such environment.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Rio Grande", "University of Rio Grande", "University of Rio Grande"], "authors": ["Mateus Bisotto Nunes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nunes:Mateus_Bisotto", "Luciana Porcher Nedel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nedel:Luciana_Porcher", "Valter Roesler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roesler:Valter"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
