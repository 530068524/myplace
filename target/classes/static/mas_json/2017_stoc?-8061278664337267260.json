In this paper we solve the problem almost optimally and show an explicit N -biased set over  k  bits with support size  O ( k /N  2+ o (1) ). This improves upon all previous explicit constructions which were in the order of  k  2 /N  2 ,  k /N  3  or  k  5/4 /N  5/2 . The result is close to the Gilbert-Varshamov bound which is  O ( k /N  2 ) and the lower bound which is I\u00a9( k /N  2  log1/N ).   The main technical tool we use is bias amplification with the  s -wide replacement product. The sum of two independent samples from an N -biased set is N  2  biased. Rozenman and Wigderson showed how to amplify the bias more economically by choosing two samples with an expander. Based on that they suggested a recursive construction that achieves sample size  O ( k /N  4 ). We show that amplification with a long random walk over the  s -wide replacement product reduces the bias almost optimally.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Amnon Ta-Shma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Ta=Shma:Amnon"], "pages": 14}
