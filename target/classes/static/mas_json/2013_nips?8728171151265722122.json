{"title": "Compete to Compute.", "fields": ["forgetting", "machine learning", "artificial intelligence", "artificial neural network", "nonlinear system"], "abstract": "Local competition among neighboring neurons is common in biological neural networks (NNs). In this paper, we apply the concept to gradient-based, backprop-trained artificial multilayer NNs. NNs with competing linear units tend to outperform those with non-competing nonlinear units, and avoid catastrophic forgetting when training sets change over time.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research"], "authors": ["Rupesh Kumar Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Rupesh_Kumar", "Jonathan Masci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masci:Jonathan", "Sohrob Kazerounian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazerounian:Sohrob", "Faustino J.
