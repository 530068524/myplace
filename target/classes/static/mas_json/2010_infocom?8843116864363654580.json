We propose an analytical approach to compute these and study the effect of coding on the performance of the network while optimizing parameters that govern routing.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "CREATE-NET, Trento, Italy"], "authors": ["Eitan Altman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altman:Eitan", "Francesco De Pellegrini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pellegrini:Francesco_De", "Lucile Sassatelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sassatelli:Lucile"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
