The incident light undergoes multiple bounces in translucent objects, and produces a complex light field. Our method analyzes the light transport in two steps. First, single and multiple scattering are separated by projecting high-frequency stripe patterns. Then, multiple scattering is decomposed into each bounce component based on the light transport equation. The light field for each bounce is recursively estimated. Experimental results show that light transport in scattering media can be decomposed and visualized for each bounce.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yasuhiro Mukaigawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukaigawa:Yasuhiro", "Yasushi Yagi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yagi:Yasushi", "Ramesh Raskar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raskar:Ramesh"], "pages": 8}
