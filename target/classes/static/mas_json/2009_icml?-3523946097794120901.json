The factored optimistic initial model (FOIM) algorithm, maintains an empirical model of the FMDP in a conventional way, and always follows a greedy policy with respect to its model. The only trick of the algorithm is that the model is initialized optimistically. We prove that with suitable initialization (i) FOIM converges to the fixed point of approximate value iteration (AVI); (ii) the number of steps when the agent makes non-near-optimal decisions (with respect to the solution of AVI) is polynomial in all relevant quantities; (iii) the per-step costs of the algorithm are also polynomial. To our best knowledge, FOIM is the first algorithm with these properties.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University"], "authors": ["Istvan Szita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szita:Istvan", "Andr\u00e1s L\u00f6rincz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=ouml=rincz:Andr=aacute=s"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
