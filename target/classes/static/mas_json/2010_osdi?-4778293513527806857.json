Current methods of executing parallel programs deterministically, however, often incur high costs, allow misbehaved software to defeat repeatability, and transform time-dependent races into input- or path-dependent races without eliminating them. We introduce a new parallel programming model addressing these issues, and use Determinator, a proof-of-concept OS, to demonstrate the model's practicality. Determinator's microkernel API provides only \"shared-nothing\" address spaces and deterministic interprocess communication primitives to make execution of all unprivileged code--well-behaved or not-- precisely repeatable. Atop this microkernel, Determinator's user-level runtime adapts optimistic replication techniques to offer a private workspace model for both thread-level and process-level parallel programing. This model avoids the introduction of read/write data races, and converts write/write races into reliably-detected conflicts. Coarse-grained parallel benchmarks perform and scale comparably to nondeterministic systems, on both multicore PCs and across nodes in a distributed cluster.", "citation": "Citations (183)", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University"], "authors": ["Amittai Aviram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aviram:Amittai", "Shu-Chun Weng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weng:Shu=Chun", "Sen Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Sen", "Bryan Ford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ford:Bryan"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2010", "pages": 14}
