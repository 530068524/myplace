Existing approaches to inference in DGP models assume approximate posteriors that force independence between the layers, and do not work well in practice. We present a doubly stochastic variational inference algorithm, which does not force independence between layers. With our method of inference we demonstrate that a DGP model can be used effectively on data ranging in size from hundreds to a billion points. We provide strong empirical evidence that our inference scheme for DGPs works well in practice in both classification and regression.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Hugh Salimbeni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salimbeni:Hugh", "Marc Peter Deisenroth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deisenroth:Marc_Peter"], "pages": 12}
