The interest in MSP is twofold: on the one hand, there are many interesting applications of MSP, and on the other hand, there is strong hope that MSP admits $O(1)$-competitive algorithms, which is the claim of the well-known matroid secretary conjecture. Partially linked to its numerous applications in online auctions, substantial interest arose also in the study of nonlinear versions of MSP, with a focus on the submodular MSP (SMSP). The fact that submodularity captures the property of diminishing returns, a very natural property for valuation functions, is a key reason for the interest in SMSP. So far, $O(1)$-competitive algorithms have been obtained for SMSP over some basic matroid classes. This created some hope that, analogously to the matroid secretary conjecture, one may even obtain $O(1)$-competitive algorithms for SMSP over any matroid. However, up to now, most questi...", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Moran Feldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldman:Moran", "Rico Zenklusen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zenklusen:Rico"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
