We show that those recommendations are greatly affected by the business context of its use. For example, the automatic defect reduction tools explored by the ASE community are only relevant to a subset of software projects, and only according to certain value criteria. Therefore, when arguing for the value of a particular technology, that argument should include a description of the value function of the target user community.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["West Virginia University", "West Virginia University", "West Virginia University", "West Virginia University"], "authors": ["Phillip Green II.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Green_II:Phillip", "Tim Menzies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menzies:Tim", "Steve Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Steve", "Oussama El-Rawas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/El=Rawas:Oussama"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
