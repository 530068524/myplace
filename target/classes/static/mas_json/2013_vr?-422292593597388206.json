By extending POIs (Point of Interest) to objects and places with Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), we could build objects of interest for mobile AR application as DOM (Document Object Model) elements and control their behavior and user interactions through DOM events. Using our content structure, a mobile AR applications can be developed as normal HTML documents seamlessly under current web eco-system.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology, Sana'a", "Korea Institute of Science and Technology", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Sang Chul Ahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahn:Sang_Chul", "Heedong Ko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ko:Heedong", "Steven Feiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feiner:Steven"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
