{"title": "Silhouettes of jazz.", "fields": ["shadow", "jazz", "sculpture", "software walkthrough", "improvisation"], "abstract": "The viewer is guided through the history of jazz by examining sculptures that exhibit distinct silhouettes when viewed from different angles in a virtual walkthrough of a shadow art museum. Shadow art is a unique form of sculptural art that exploits the fact that we can recognize objects from their shadows or silhouettes. Improvisation, a key ingredient of jazz, is mirrored in the ambiguity of shadow sculptures, where many different 3D shapes can cast the same 2D shadow.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Switzerland"], "authors": ["Dominik K\u00e4ser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=auml=ser:Dominik"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
