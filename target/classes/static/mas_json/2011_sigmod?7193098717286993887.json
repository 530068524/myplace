Skyline queries, i.e., queries that involve computation of a skyline, can be computationally expensive, so it is natural to consider parallelized approaches which make good use of multiple processors. We approach this problem by using hyperplane projections to obtain useful partitions of the data set for parallel processing. These partitions not only ensure small local skyline sets, but enable efficient merging of results as well. Our experiments show that our method consistently outperforms similar approaches for parallel skyline computation, regardless of data distribution, and provides insights on the impacts of different optimization strategies.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Queensland", "Renmin University of China", "University of Queensland"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Henning K\u00f6hler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=hler:Henning", "Jing Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jing", "Xiaofang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiaofang"], "pages": 12}
