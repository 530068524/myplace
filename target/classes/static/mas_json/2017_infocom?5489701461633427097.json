The idea is iterating a basic contention mechanism, devised to select a sub-set of stations among the contending ones, in consecutive elimination rounds, before performing a transmission attempt. Elimination rounds can be performed in the time or frequency domain, with different overheads, according to the physical capabilities of the nodes. Closed analytical formulas are given to dimension the number of contention rounds in order to achieve an arbitrary low collision probability. Simulation results and a real implementation for the time-domain solution demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of this approach in comparison to IEEE 802.11 DCF.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Palermo", "University of Palermo", "University of Palermo", "University of R ... za, Roma, Italy"], "authors": ["Andrea Baiocchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baiocchi:Andrea", "Ilenia Tinnirello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tinnirello:Ilenia", "Domenico Garlisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garlisi:Domenico", "Alice Lo Valvo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valvo:Alice_Lo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
