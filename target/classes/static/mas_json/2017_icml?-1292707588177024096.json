We provide theoretical convergence analysis for both proposed algorithms and demonstrate our methods' computational efficiency compared to classical accelerated gradient method, and the state of the art variance-reduced stochastic gradient methods through numerical experiments in various large synthetic/real data sets.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Junqi Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Junqi", "Mohammad Golbabaee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golbabaee:Mohammad", "Mike E.
