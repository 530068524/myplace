{"title": "Comparing Touchscreen and Mouse Input Performance by People With and Without Upper Body Motor Impairments.", "fields": ["computer hardware", "touchscreen", "word error rate", "input device", "pointing device"], "abstract": "Controlled studies of touchscreen input performance for users with upper body motor impairments remain relatively sparse. To address this gap, we present a controlled lab study of mouse vs. touchscreen performance with 32 participants (16 with upper body motor impairments and 16 without). Our study examines: (1) how touch input compares to an indirect pointing device (a mouse); (2) how performance compares across a range of standard interaction techniques; and (3) how these answers differ for users with and without motor impairments. While the touchscreen was faster than the mouse overall, only participants without motor impairments benefited from a lower error rate on the touchscreen. Indeed, participants  with  motor impairments had a  three-fold increase  in pointing (tapping) errors on the touchscreen compared to the mouse. Our findings also highlight the high frequency of spurious touches for users with motor impairments and update past accessibility recommendations for minimum touchscreen target sizes to at least 18mm.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "McGill University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Leah Findlater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Findlater:Leah", "Karyn Moffatt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moffatt:Karyn", "Jon E.
