{"title": "Boosting for transfer learning with multiple sources.", "fields": ["training set", "negative transfer", "transfer of learning", "retraining", "boosting"], "abstract": "Transfer learning allows leveraging the knowledge of source domains, available a priori, to help training a classifier for a target domain, where the available data is scarce. The effectiveness of the transfer is affected by the relationship between source and target. Rather than improving the learning, brute force leveraging of a source poorly related to the target may decrease the classifier performance. One strategy to reduce this negative transfer is to import knowledge from multiple sources to increase the chance of finding one source closely related to the target. This work extends the boosting framework for transferring knowledge from multiple sources. Two new algorithms, MultiSource-TrAdaBoost, and TaskTrAdaBoost, are introduced, analyzed, and applied for object category recognition and specific object detection. The experiments demonstrate their improved performance by greatly reducing the negative transfer as the number of sources increases. TaskTrAdaBoost is a fast algorithm enabling rapid retraining over new targets.", "citation": "Citations (181)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["General Electric", "General Electric"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yi Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Yi", "Gianfranco Doretto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doretto:Gianfranco"], "pages": 8}
