This approach has several advantages over similar eye-gaze systems, including a larger password space and its cued-recall nature that can help users remember multiple distinct passwords. Our 45-participant lab study is the first evaluation of gaze-based password entry via user-selected points on images. CGP's usability is potentially acceptable, warranting further refinement and study.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Carleton University", "Carleton University", "Carleton University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alain Forget.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forget:Alain", "Sonia Chiasson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiasson:Sonia", "Robert Biddle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biddle:Robert"], "pages": 4}
