For the Poisson gamma belief network (PGBN), a recently proposed deep discrete LVM, we derive an alternative representation that is referred to as deep latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA). Exploiting data augmentation and marginalization techniques, we derive a block-diagonal Fisher information matrix and its inverse for the simplex-constrained global model parameters of DLDA. Exploiting that Fisher information matrix with stochastic gradient MCMC, we present topic-layer-adaptive stochastic gradient Riemannian (TLASGR) MCMC that jointly learns simplex-constrained global parameters across all layers and topics, with topic and layer specific learning rates. State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on big data sets.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Xidian University", "Xidian University", "Xidian University", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yulai Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Yulai", "Bo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Bo", "Hongwei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Hongwei", "Mingyuan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Mingyuan"], "pages": 10}
