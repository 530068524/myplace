In this paper we introduce a novel test suite adequacy criterion based on output uniqueness. We propose 4 definitions of output uniqueness with varying degrees of strictness. We present a preliminary evaluation for web application testing that confirms that output uniqueness enhances fault-finding effectiveness. The approach outperforms random augmentation in fault finding ability by an overall average of 280% in 5 medium sized, real world web applications.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Nadia Alshahwan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alshahwan:Nadia", "Mark Harman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harman:Mark"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
