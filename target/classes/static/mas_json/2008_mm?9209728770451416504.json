We called our system Palimpsest, referring to the tradition of medieval copies of books, when a manuscript is erased and re-written with new text. The basic idea is to combine one photograph with another on a pixel-by-pixel basis and to apply Cellular Automata rules to further mix in real-time the images together. The Cellular Automaton, will, from a series of randomly chosen seed pixels, slowly merge an image with another. It is worth noticing that more than two images can overlap at the same time. The key point is that this transformation process is part of the artwork itself, bringing some mesmerizing aspect to the flux of images.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Keio University"], "authors": ["Philippe Codognet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Codognet:Philippe"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
