Collections of squares, rectangles, polytopes, and so on, can readily be defined by means of linear systems with parameters. In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning a parameterized linear system whose class of polyhedra includes a given set of example polyhedral sets and it is minimal.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Pisa"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Salvatore Ruggieri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruggieri:Salvatore"], "pages": 7}
