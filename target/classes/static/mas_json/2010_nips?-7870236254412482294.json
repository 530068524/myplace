We conclude that this new quantity tightly characterizes the true sample complexity of large-margin classification. The bounds hold for a rich family of sub-Gaussian distributions.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Sivan Sabato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabato:Sivan", "Nathan Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nathan", "Naftali Tishby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tishby:Naftali"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
