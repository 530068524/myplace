The proof explicitly incorporates the relaxed memory semantics of x86 multiprocessors. To our knowledge, this is the first fully machine-checked proof of safety for such a garbage collector. We couch the proof in a framework that system implementers will find appealing, with the fundamental components of the system specified in a simple and intuitive programming language. The abstract model is detailed enough for its correspondence with an assembly language implementation to be straightforward.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["NICTA", "Purdue University", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Peter Gammie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gammie:Peter", "Antony L.
