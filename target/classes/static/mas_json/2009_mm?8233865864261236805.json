{"title": "What is a complete set of keywords for image description & annotation on the web.", "fields": ["probabilistic latent semantic analysis", "annotation", "generative grammar", "topic model", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "Does there exist a compact set of keywords that can completely and effectively cover the image annotation problem by expanding from it? In this paper, we answer this question by presenting a complete set framework for image annotation, which is motivated by the existence of semantic ontology. To generate this set, we propose a cross model optimization strategy from both textual and visual information for topic decomposition, based on a so-called Bipartite LSA model, which minimize multimodal error energy functions in a probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis model. To achieve complete set based annotation, we present a Gaussian-Kernel-Generative process based keyword generation procedure, which analogizes keyword annotation in a probabilistic generative manner. A group of experiments is performed on Washington University image database and 80,000 Flickr images with comparisons to the state-of-the-arts. Finally, potential advantages and future improvements of our framework are discussed outside the scope of topic modeling.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Xianming Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xianming", "Hongxun Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Hongxun", "Rongrong Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Rongrong", "Pengfei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Pengfei", "Xiaoshuai Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Xiaoshuai"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
