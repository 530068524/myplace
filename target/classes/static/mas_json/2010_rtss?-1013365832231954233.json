We focus on the transmission specification of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard to provide actual transmission estimates. The paper analyses the optimal conditions for sending periodic packets with 1 or 2 transmission times and fixed deadlines. Simulations provide the transceiver usage values under the calculated optimal scheduling conditions. The simulations extend the results by looking at 8 transmission times and an exponential distribution of packet release times. A counterintuitive result is the occurrence of a performance decrease with increasing deadline, other conditions remaining constant.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Philips", "Philips"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Marc Aoun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aoun:Marc", "Peter van der Stok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stok:Peter_van_der"], "pages": 11}
