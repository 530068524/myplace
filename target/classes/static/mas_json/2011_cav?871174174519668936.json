We present a model checking algorithm for FSMTs, which works on fully symbolic state sets containing both the clock values and the state variables. In order to verify timed automata (TAs) with our model checking algorithm, we present two different methods to convert TAs to FSMTs. In addition to pure interleaving semantics we can convert TAs to FSMTs having a parallelized interleaving behavior which allows parallelism of transitions causing no conflicts. This can dramatically reduce the number of steps during verification. Our experimental results show that our prototype implementation outperforms the state-of-the-art model checkers UPPAAL and RED.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Georges Morb\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morb=eacute=:Georges", "Florian Pigorsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pigorsch:Florian", "Christoph Scholl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scholl:Christoph"], "pages": 17}
