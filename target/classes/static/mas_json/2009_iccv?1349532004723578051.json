{"title": "A branch-and-bound algorithm for globally optimal calibration of a camera-and-rotation-sensor system.", "fields": ["data set", "rotation matrix", "branch and bound", "residual", "optical rotation"], "abstract": "We propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to obtain the globally optimal relative rotation between a camera and the rotation sensor attached to it. Compared to previous methods, our approach directly minimizes the image space error related to the measurements which is very natural for camera-based systems. Our algorithm is based on the observation that we may evaluate the residual when the rotation matrix is known. We propose a feasibility test algorithm for the branch-and-bound to efficiently reduce the search volume of the rotation domain. Experimental results are provided using synthetic and real data sets.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Sogang University", "Sogang University", "Sogang University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yongduek Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Yongduek", "Youngju Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Youngju", "Sang Wook Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sang_Wook"], "pages": 6}
