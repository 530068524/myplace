{"title": "SPOT: A System for Detecting Projected Outliers From High-dimensional Data Streams.", "fields": ["group method of data handling", "anomaly detection", "clustering high dimensional data", "data stream mining", "outlier"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new technique, called stream projected ouliter detector (SPOT), to deal with outlier detection problem in high-dimensional data streams. SPOT is unique in a number of aspects. First, SPOT employs a novel window-based time model and decaying cell summaries to capture statistics from the data stream. Second, sparse subspace template (SST), a set of top sparse subspaces obtained by unsupervised and/or supervised learning processes, is constructed in SPOT to detect projected outliers effectively. Multi-Objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is employed as an effective search method in unsupervised learning for finding outlying subspaces from training data. Finally, SST is able to carry out online self- evolution to cope with dynamics of data streams. This paper provides details on the motivation and technical challenges of detecting outliers from high-dimensional data streams, present an overview of SPOT, and give the plans for system demonstration of SPOT.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Dalhousie University", "Dalhousie University", "Saint Mary's University"], "authors": ["Ji Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ji", "Qigang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Qigang", "Hai H.
