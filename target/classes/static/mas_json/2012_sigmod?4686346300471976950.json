Existing methods to support similarity join usually adopt a prefix-filtering-based framework. They select a prefix of each object and prune object pairs whose prefixes have no overlap. We have an observation that prefix lengths have significant effect on the performance. Different prefix lengths lead to significantly different performance, and prefix filtering does not always achieve high performance. To address this problem, in this paper we propose an adaptive framework to support similarity join. We propose a cost model to judiciously select an appropriate prefix for each object. To efficiently select prefixes, we devise effective indexes. We extend our method to support similarity search. Experimental results show that our framework beats the prefix-filtering-based framework and achieves high efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (149)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jiannan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jiannan", "Guoliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Guoliang", "Jianhua Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jianhua"], "pages": 12}
