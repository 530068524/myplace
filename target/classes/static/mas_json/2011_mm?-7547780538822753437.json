In this paper, we propose a scheme to integrate rich information for video recommendation. We regard video recommendation as a ranking problem and generate multiple ranking lists by exploring different information sources. A multi-task rank aggregation approach is proposed to integrate the ranking lists for different users in a joint manner. Our scheme is flexible and can easily incorporate other methods by adding their generated ranking lists into our multi-task learning algorithm. We conduct experiments with 76 users and more than 10,000 videos. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Beihang University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Xiaojian Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xiaojian", "Guangda Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Guangda", "Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Meng", "Jin Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Jin", "Zheng-Jun Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Zheng=Jun", "Zhoujun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhoujun", "Tat-Seng Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Tat=Seng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
