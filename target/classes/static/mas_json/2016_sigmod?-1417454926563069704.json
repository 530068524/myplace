{"title": "Enabling Incremental Query Re-Optimization.", "fields": ["adaptive optimization", "datalog", "web query classification", "sargable", "query plan"], "abstract": "As declarative query processing techniques expand to the Web, data streams, network routers, and cloud platforms, there is an increasing need to re-plan execution in the presence of unanticipated performance changes. New runtime information may affect which query plan we prefer to run. Adaptive techniques require innovation both in terms of the  algorithms used to estimate costs , and in terms of the  search algorithm  that finds the best plan. We investigate how to build a cost-based optimizer that recomputes the optimal plan  incrementally  given new cost information, much as a stream engine constantly updates its outputs given new data. Our implementation especially shows benefits for stream processing workloads. It lays the foundations upon which a variety of novel adaptive optimization algorithms can be built. We start by leveraging the recently proposed approach of formulating query plan enumeration as a set of  recursive datalog queries ; we develop a variety of novel optimization approaches to ensure effective pruning in both static and incremental cases. We further show that the lessons learned in the declarative implementation can be equally applied to more traditional optimizer implementations.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Walmart Labs", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Mengmeng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Mengmeng", "Zachary G.
