In this paper, we demonstrate the Continuous Change Impact Analysis Process (CCIP) that breaks up the isolation by actively taking into account project dependencies. The implemented CCIP approach extends the traditional continuous integration (CI) process by enforcing communication between CI servers whenever new artifact updates are available. We show that the exchange of CI process results contribute to improving effectiveness of automated testing.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["TU Vienna, Austria", "TU Vienna, Austria", "TU Vienna, Austria"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Stefan D\u00f6singer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=ouml=singer:Stefan", "Richard Mordinyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mordinyi:Richard", "Stefan Biffl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biffl:Stefan"], "pages": 4}
