{"title": "Towards requirements aware systems: Run-time resolution of design-time assumptions.", "fields": ["adaptive system", "systems engineering", "formal verification", "formal specification", "satisfiability"], "abstract": "In earlier work we proposed the idea of requirements-aware systems that could introspect about the extent to which their goals were being satisfied at runtime. When combined with requirements monitoring and self adaptive capabilities, requirements awareness should help optimize goal satisfaction even in the presence of changing run-time context. In this paper we describe initial progress towards the realization of requirements-aware systems with REAssuRE. REAssuRE focuses on explicit representation of assumptions made at design time. When such assumptions are shown not to hold, REAssuRE can trigger system adaptations to alternative goal realization strategies.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Kristopher Welsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welsh:Kristopher", "Pete Sawyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sawyer:Pete", "Nelly Bencomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bencomo:Nelly"], "pages": 4}
