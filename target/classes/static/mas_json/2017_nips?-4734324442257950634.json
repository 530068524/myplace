We conjecture and provide empirical and theoretical evidence that with small enough step sizes and initialization close enough to the origin, gradient descent on a full dimensional factorization converges to the minimum nuclear norm solution.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "TTI Chicago", "Institute for Advanced Study", "TTI Chicago"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Suriya Gunasekar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gunasekar:Suriya", "Blake E.
