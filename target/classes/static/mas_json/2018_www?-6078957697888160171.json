{"title": "Subgraph-augmented Path Embedding for Semantic User Search on Heterogeneous Social Network.", "fields": ["data set", "heterogeneous network", "semantics", "baseline", "embedding"], "abstract": "Semantic user search is an important task on heterogeneous social network. Its core problem is to measure the proximity between two user objects in the network w.r.t. certain semantic user relation. The state-of-the-art solutions often take a path-based approach, which uses the sequences of objects connecting a query user and a target user to measure their proximity. Despite the success of this path-based approach, we argue that path as a low-order structure is insufficient to capture the rich semantics between two users. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a novel concept of subgraph-augmented path for semantic user search. Specifically, we consider sampling a set of object paths from a query user to a target user; then in each object path, we replace the linear object sequence between its every two neighboring users with their shared subgraph instances. Such subgraph-augmented paths are expected to leverage both path\u2019s distance awareness and subgraph\u2019s high-order structure. As it is non-trivial to model such subgraph-augmented paths, we develop a Subgraph-augmented Path Embedding (SPE) framework to accomplish the task. We evaluate our solution on six semantic user relations in three real-world public data sets, and show it outperforms the baselines.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Google", "Zhejiang University", "Alibaba Group", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Zemin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zemin", "Vincent W.
