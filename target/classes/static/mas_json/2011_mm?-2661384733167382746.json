The results demonstrate the existence of Just Noticeable Degradation and Just Unacceptable Degradation thresholds on the factor. In light of the results, we describe the design and implementation of a real-time perception-based quality adaptor for 3D tele-immersive video. Our experimental results show that the adaptation scheme can reduce resource usage while considerably enhancing the overall perceived visual quality.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Wanmin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Wanmin", "Ahsan Arefin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arefin:Ahsan", "Gregorij Kurillo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurillo:Gregorij", "Pooja Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Pooja", "Klara Nahrstedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nahrstedt:Klara", "Ruzena Bajcsy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bajcsy:Ruzena"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
