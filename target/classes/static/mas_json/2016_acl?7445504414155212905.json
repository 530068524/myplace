The basic idea is to encourage two asymmetric latent-variable translation models (i.e., source-to-target and target-to-source) to agree on identifying latent phrase and word alignments. The agreement is defined at both word and phrase levels. We develop a Viterbi EM algorithm for jointly training the two unidirectional models efficiently. Experiments on the ChineseEnglish dataset show that agreementbased learning significantly improves both alignment and translation performance.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Samsung"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Chunyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chunyang", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Yang", "Maosong Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Maosong", "Huan-Bo Luan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luan:Huan=Bo", "Heng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Heng"], "pages": -1}
