{"title": "Behavior and properties of spatio-temporal local features under visual transformations.", "fields": ["cuboid", "invariant", "multimedia", "robustness", "frame rate"], "abstract": "Successful state-of-the-art video retrieval and classification applications are predominantly carried out by means of spatio-temporal features. Typically, the evaluation of these tasks is exclusively done based on their final performance but no systematic analysis of feature robustness, invariance and stability has been done yet for large scale video retrieval. In this work, we analyze the impact of visual transformation on spatio-temporal features in large scale experiments. Following the recipe of recent state of the art evaluations, we choose the best performing approaches, namely the spatio-temporal Harris3D, Hessian3D, and Cuboid detectors and the HOG/HOF, SURF3D, and HOG3D descriptors. We show that these features have different properties and behave differently under varying transformations (challenges). This helps researchers to justify the choice of features for new applications and helps to optimize the choice of input video in terms of resolution, compression, frames per second or noise suppression. We make the extracted features accessible on-line for further independent evaluation and applications.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "University of Trento", "Information Retrieval Facility", "Technical Unive ... , Iasi, Romania"], "authors": ["Julian St\u00f6ttinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/St=ouml=ttinger:Julian", "Bogdan Tudor Goras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goras:Bogdan_Tudor", "Nicu Sebe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebe:Nicu", "Allan Hanbury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanbury:Allan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
