{"title": "Auto-patching DOM-based XSS at scale.", "fields": ["cross site scripting", "code injection", "taint checking", "string interpolation", "dynamic html"], "abstract": "DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection vulnerability that results from unsafe dynamic code generation in JavaScript applications, and has few known practical defenses. We study dynamic code evaluation practices on nearly a quarter million URLs crawled starting from the the Alexa Top 1000 websites. Of 777,082 cases of dynamic HTML/JS code generation we observe, 13.3% use unsafe string interpolation for dynamic code generation \u2014 a well-known dangerous coding practice. To remedy this, we propose a technique to generate secure patches that replace unsafe string interpolation with safer code that utilizes programmatic DOM construction techniques. Our system transparently auto-patches the vulnerable site while incurring only 5.2 \u2212 8.07% overhead. The patching mechanism requires no access to server-side code or modification to browsers, and thus is practical as a turnkey defense.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Inian Parameshwaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parameshwaran:Inian", "Enrico Budianto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Budianto:Enrico", "Shweta Shinde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shinde:Shweta", "Hung Dang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dang:Hung", "Atul Sadhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadhu:Atul", "Prateek Saxena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saxena:Prateek"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
