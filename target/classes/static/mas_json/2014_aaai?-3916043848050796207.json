{"title": "Scheduling for Transfers in Pickup and Delivery Problems with Very Large Neighborhood Search.", "fields": ["scheduling", "pickup", "simulation", "mathematical optimization", "schedule"], "abstract": "In pickup and delivery problems (PDPs), vehicles pickup and deliver a set of items under various constraints. We address the PDP with Transfers (PDP-T), in which vehicles plan to transfer items between one another to form more efficient schedules. We introduce the Very Large Neighborhood Search with Transfers (VLNS-T) algorithm to form schedules for the PDP-T. Our approach allows multiple transfers for items at arbitrary locations, and is not restricted to a set of predefined transfer points. We show that VLNS-T improves upon the best known PDP solutions for benchmark problems, and demonstrate its effectiveness on problems sampled from real world taxi data in New York City.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Brian Coltin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coltin:Brian", "Manuela M.
