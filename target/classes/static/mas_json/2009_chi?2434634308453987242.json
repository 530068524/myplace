Medical science is starting to understand and develop touch-based therapies for autism spectrum, mood, anxiety and borderline disorders. Based on the most promising touch therapy protocols, we are presenting the first devices that simulate touch through haptic devices to bring relief and assist clinical therapy for mental health. We present several haptic systems that enable medical professionals to facilitate the collaboration between patients and doctors and potentially pave the way for a new form of non-invasive treatment that could be adapted from use in care-giving facilities to public use. We developed these prototypes working closely with a team of mental health professionals.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Cati Vaucelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaucelle:Cati", "Leonardo Bonanni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonanni:Leonardo", "Hiroshi Ishii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishii_0001:Hiroshi"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
