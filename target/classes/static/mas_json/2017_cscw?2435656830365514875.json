{"title": "Parents Just Don't Understand: Why Teens Don't Talk to Parents about Their Online Risk Experiences.", "fields": ["social psychology", "psychology"], "abstract": "Past research has shown that parents tend to underestimate the frequency with which their teens experience online risks. However, little is known about whether and how teens communicate with their parents when online risks do occur. In a two-month, web-based diary study of 68 teen-parent pairs, participants provided separate accounts of the teens' weekly online risk experiences. We found that most teens had little or no communication with their parents regarding their online risk experiences, and parents and teens shared very different perceptions and reactions when risks were reported, helping explain why communication was so poor. We discuss the implications of our results and make recommendations for how researchers and designers may work to improve the state of family communication regarding adolescent online risks in the future.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Pamela J.
