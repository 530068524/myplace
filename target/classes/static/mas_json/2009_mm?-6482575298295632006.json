{"title": "TuVista: meeting the multimedia needs of mobile sports fans.", "fields": ["rapid prototyping", "non linear editing system", "video editing", "push technology", "workflow"], "abstract": "We describe the TuVista system, a service for viewing near-live sports content consisting of a multimedia editing/bundling station, a cloud-hosted metadata server, and a set of mobile clients. We begin by introducing TuVista I, a proof of concept experience prototype implemented quickly as a probe to understand multimedia needs at a live sporting event. After discussing the results of an initial field trial at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, we describe the improvements in TuVista II to address the issues identified. These include rapid editing of multiple live video streams, push notifications of new content over XMPP, and an optimized metadata workflow for the content producer that reduced content publication time from fifteen minutes to less than 30 seconds. We conclude with a discussion of rapid prototyping and field deployments as a way to quickly identify user needs.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Motorola", "Motorola"], "authors": ["Frank R.
