This connectedness is found in many incarnations: in the rapid growth of the Internet, in the ease with which global communication takes place, and in the ability of news and information as well as epidemics and financial crises to spread with surprising speed and intensity. These are phenomena that involve networks, incentives, and the aggregate behavior of groups of people; they are based on the links that connect us and the ways in which our decisions can have subtle consequences for others. This introductory undergraduate textbook takes an interdisciplinary look at economics, sociology, computing and information science, and applied mathematics to understand networks and behavior. It describes the emerging field of study that is growing at the interface of these areas, addressing fundamental questions about how the social, economic, and technological worlds are connected.", "citation": "Citations (2,264)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Institut Eur\u00e9com", "Institut Eur\u00e9com", "Northwestern University", "University of California, Berkeley", "Hewlett-Packard", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "California Inst ... e of Technology"], "authors": ["Yuezhou Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Yuezhou", "Thomas Moscibroda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moscibroda:Thomas"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
