{"title": "UFlood: High-throughput flooding over wireless mesh networks.", "fields": ["wireless mesh network", "throughput", "software", "linear network coding", "communication source"], "abstract": "This paper proposes UFlood, a flooding protocol for wireless mesh networks. UFlood targets situations such as software updates where all nodes need to receive the same large file of data, and where limited radio range requires forwarding. UFlood's goals are high throughput and low airtime, defined respectively as rate of completion of a flood to the slowest receiving node and total time spent transmitting. The key to achieving these goals is good choice of sender for each transmission opportunity. The best choice evolves as a flood proceeds in ways that are difficult to predict.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jayashree Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Jayashree", "Robert Tappan Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Robert_Tappan", "Hari Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Hari"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
