{"title": "Robust piecewise-planar 3D reconstruction and completion from large-scale unstructured point data.", "fields": ["planar", "3d reconstruction", "polygon", "point cloud", "piecewise"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel method, the first to date to our knowledge, which is capable of directly and automatically producing a concise and idealized 3D representation from unstructured point data of complex cluttered real-world scenes, with a high level of noise and a significant proportion of outliers, such as those obtained from passive stereo. Our algorithm can digest millions of input points into an optimized lightweight watertight polygonal mesh free of self-intersection, that preserves the structural components of the scene at a user-defined scale, and completes missing scene parts in a plausible manner. To achieve this, our algorithm incorporates priors on urban and architectural scenes, notably the prevalence of vertical structures and orthogonal intersections. A major contribution of our work is an adaptive decomposition of 3D space induced by planar primitives, namely a polyhedral cell complex. We experimentally validate our approach on several challenging noisy point clouds of urban and architectural scenes.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Anne-Laure Chauve.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chauve:Anne=Laure", "Patrick Labatut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Labatut:Patrick", "Jean-Philippe Pons.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pons:Jean=Philippe"], "pages": 8}
