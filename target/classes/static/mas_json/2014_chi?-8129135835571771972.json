{"title": "Bored mondays and focused afternoons: the rhythm of attention and online activity in the workplace.", "fields": ["digital media", "experience sampling method", "boredom", "end of day", "human multitasking"], "abstract": "While distractions using digital media have received attention in HCI, understanding engagement in workplace activities has been little explored. We logged digital activity and continually probed perspectives of 32 information workers for five days  in situ  to understand how attentional states change with context. We present a framework of how engagement and challenge in work relate to focus, boredom, and rote work. Overall, we find more focused attention than boredom in the workplace. Focus peaks mid-afternoon while boredom is highest in early afternoon. People are happiest doing rote work and most stressed doing focused work. On Mondays people are most bored but also most focused. Online activities are associated with different attentional states, showing different patterns at beginning and end of day, and before and after a mid-day break. Our study shows how rhythms of attentional states are associated with context and time, even in a dynamic workplace environment.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gloria Mark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mark:Gloria", "Shamsi T.
