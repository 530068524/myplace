{"title": "Flipping bits in memory without accessing them: An experimental study of DRAM disturbance errors.", "fields": ["row", "memory rank", "memory address", "universal memory", "root cause"], "abstract": "Memory isolation is a key property of a reliable and secure computing system--an access to one memory address should not have unintended side effects on data stored in other addresses. However, as DRAM process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, it becomes more difficult to prevent DRAM cells from electrically interacting with each other. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of commodity DRAM chips to disturbance errors. By reading from the same address in DRAM, we show that it is possible to corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically, activating the same row in DRAM corrupts data in nearby rows. We demonstrate this phenomenon on Intel and AMD systems using a malicious program that generates many DRAM accesses. We induce errors in most DRAM modules (110 out of 129) from three major DRAM manufacturers. From this we conclude that many deployed systems are likely to be at risk. We identify the root cause of disturbance errors as the repeated toggling of a DRAM row's wordline, which stresses inter-cell coupling effects that accelerate charge leakage from nearby rows. We provide an extensive characterization study of disturbance errors and their behavior using an FPGA-based testing platform. Among our key findings, we show that (i) it takes as few as 139K accesses to induce an error and (ii) up to one in every 1.7K cells is susceptible to errors. After examining various potential ways of addressing the problem, we propose a low-overhead solution to prevent the errors", "citation": "Citations (307)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Yoongu Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Yoongu", "Ross Daly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daly:Ross", "Jeremie Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jeremie", "Chris Fallin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fallin:Chris", "Ji-Hye Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Ji=Hye", "Donghyuk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Donghyuk", "Chris Wilkerson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilkerson:Chris", "Konrad Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Konrad", "Onur Mutlu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mutlu:Onur"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
