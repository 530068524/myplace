This promise however is yet to be fulfilled, with search for relevant literature for a given patient condition still being an active research topic. The TREC CDS track was designed to address this research gap. We developed a platform to facilitate experimentation and hypothesis testing for information retrieval researchers working on this topic. It provides a large range of query and document processing techniques that are explored in the biomedical search domain.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "University of Sydney", "RMIT University", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation"], "authors": ["Sarvnaz Karimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karimi:Sarvnaz", "Vincent Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Vincent", "Falk Scholer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scholer:Falk", "Brian Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Brian", "Sara Falamaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Falamaki:Sara"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
