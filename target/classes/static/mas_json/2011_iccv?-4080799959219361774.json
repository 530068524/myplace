We define action attributes as the verbs that describe the properties of human actions, while the parts of actions are objects and poselets that are closely related to the actions. We jointly model the attributes and parts by learning a set of sparse bases that are shown to carry much semantic meaning. Then, the attributes and parts of an action image can be reconstructed from sparse coefficients with respect to the learned bases. This dual sparsity provides theoretical guarantee of our bases learning and feature reconstruction approach. On the PASCAL action dataset and a new \u201cStanford 40 Actions\u201d dataset, we show that our method extracts meaningful high-order interactions between attributes and parts in human actions while achieving state-of-the-art classification performance.", "citation": "Citations (394)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Bangpeng Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Bangpeng", "Xiaoye Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Xiaoye", "Aditya Khosla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khosla:Aditya", "Andy Lai Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Andy_Lai", "Leonidas J.
