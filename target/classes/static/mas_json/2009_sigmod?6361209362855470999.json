{"title": "Exploring schema repositories with schemr.", "fields": ["star schema", "database schema", "search analytics", "schema migration", "information schema"], "abstract": "Schemr is a schema search engine, and provides users the ability to search for and visualize schemas stored in a metadata repository. Users may search by keywords and by example -- using schema fragments as query terms. Schemr uses a novel search algorithm, based on a combination of text search and schema matching techniques, as well as a structurally-aware scoring metric. Schemr presents search results in a GUI that allows users to explore which elements match and how well they do. The GUI supports interactions, including panning, zooming, layout and drilling-in. We demonstrate schema search and visualization, introduce Schemr as a new component of the information integration toolbox, and discuss its benefits in several applications.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kuang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Kuang", "Jayant Madhavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madhavan:Jayant", "Alon Y.
