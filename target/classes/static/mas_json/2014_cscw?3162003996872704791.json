We also find that researchers have not thoroughly investigated how different households use these systems and how their uses differ from one another. We explore these questions in a 4-10 month field deployment of a social-energy monitoring application across 15 households, in two distinct locations. We contribute results that describe conditions under which these techniques were effective and ineffective. Our results imply that understanding factors such as a building, or community's layout, context knowledge of community members, accountability and adherence to social norms, trust, and length of residence are key for future design of social-energy applications.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Tawanna Dillahunt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dillahunt:Tawanna", "Jennifer Mankoff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mankoff:Jennifer"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
