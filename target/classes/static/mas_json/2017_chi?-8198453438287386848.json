{"title": "Changing Moods: How Manual Tracking by Family Caregivers Improves Caring and Family Communication.", "fields": ["health technology", "health care", "family caregivers", "mood", "behavior change"], "abstract": "Previous research on healthcare technologies has shown how health tracking promotes desired behavior changes and effective health management. However, little is known about how the family caregivers' use of tracking technologies impacts the patient-caregiver relationship in the home. In this paper, we explore how health-tracking technologies could be designed to support family caregivers cope better with a depressed family member. Based on an interview study, we designed a simple tracking tool called Family Mood and Care Tracker (FMCT) and deployed it for six weeks in the homes of 14 family caregivers who were caring for a depressed family member. FMCT is a tracking tool designed specifically for family caregivers to record their caregiving activities and patient's conditions. Our findings demonstrate how caregivers used it to better understand the illness and cope with depressed family members. We also show how our tool improves family communication, despite the initial concerns about patient-caregiver conflicts.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "University of Tsukuba", "Future University Hakodate", "Osaka University", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Naomi Yamashita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamashita:Naomi", "Hideaki Kuzuoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuzuoka:Hideaki", "Keiji Hirata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirata:Keiji", "Takashi Kudo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kudo:Takashi", "Eiji Aramaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aramaki:Eiji", "Kazuki Hattori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hattori:Kazuki"], "pages": 12}
