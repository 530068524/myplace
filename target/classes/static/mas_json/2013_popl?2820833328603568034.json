While practical and widely used, these compilers are ad hoc: no guarantee is provided on their correctness for whole programs, nor their security for programs executed within arbitrary JavaScript contexts. This paper presents a compiler with such guarantees. We compile an ML-like language with higher-order functions and references to JavaScript, while preserving all source program properties. Relying on type-based invariants and applicative bisimilarity, we show full abstraction: two programs are equivalent in all source contexts if and only if their wrapped translations are equivalent in all JavaScript contexts. We evaluate our compiler on sample programs, including a series of secure libraries.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["C\u00e9dric Fournet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fournet:C=eacute=dric", "Nikhil Swamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swamy:Nikhil", "Juan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Juan", "Pierre-\u00c9variste Dagand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dagand:Pierre==Eacute=variste", "Pierre-Yves Strub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strub:Pierre=Yves", "Benjamin Livshits.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Livshits:Benjamin"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2013", "pages": 14}
