{"title": "Feature shaping for linear SVM classifiers.", "fields": ["perceptron", "linear classifier", "feature learning", "feature", "feature scaling"], "abstract": "Linear classifiers have been shown to be effective for many discrimination tasks. Irrespective of the learning algorithm itself, the final classifier has a weight to multiply by each feature. This suggests that ideally each input feature should be linearly correlated with the target variable (or anti-correlated), whereas raw features may be highly non-linear. In this paper, we attempt to re-shape each input feature so that it is appropriate to use with a linear weight and to scale the different features in proportion to their predictive value. We demonstrate that this pre-processing is beneficial for linear SVM classifiers on a large benchmark of text classification tasks as well as UCI datasets.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["George Forman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forman:George", "Martin Scholz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scholz:Martin", "Shyamsundar Rajaram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajaram:Shyamsundar"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
