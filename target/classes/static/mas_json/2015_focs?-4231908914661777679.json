Our proof uses an embedding of l2 into the space of matrices endowed with the trace norm with the property that the image of standard basis vectors is longer than that of unit vectors with no large coordinates. We also observe that one can obtain a tight NP-hardness result for the commutative Little Grothendieck problem; previously, this was only known based on the Unique Games Conjecture (Khot and Naor, Mathematika 2009).", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "IBM", "New York University", "New York University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Jop Bri\u00ebt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bri=euml=t:Jop", "Oded Regev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regev_0001:Oded", "Rishi Saket.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saket:Rishi"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 15}
