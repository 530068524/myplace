{"title": "Extending X3D with Perceptual Auditory Properties.", "fields": ["rendering", "augmented reality", "audio signal processing", "reverberation", "x3d"], "abstract": "In this paper we present our approach to extend X3D with audio effects like reverberation, echo or distortion. We describe our concept of \"sound textures\" and the nodes and fields we added to the X3D specification to model ambient audio environments. Furthermore we describe our implementation of our audio-visual renderer.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society", "Univ. of Appl.  ... ci., Dusseldorf"], "authors": ["Katharina Garbe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garbe:Katharina", "Iris Herbst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herbst:Iris"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
