We show that a uniformly chosen voter profile for a neutral social choice function f of q \u2265 4 alternatives and n voters will be manipulable with probability at least 10\u22124\u22082 n \u22123 q \u221230, where \u2208 is the minimal statistical distance between f and the family of dictator functions.\n\nOur results extend those of [11], which were obtained for the case of 3 alternatives, and imply that the approach of masking manipulations behind computational hardness (as considered in [4,6,9,15,7]) cannot hide manipulations completely.\n\nOur proof is geometric. More specifically it extends the method of canonical paths to show that the measure of the profiles that lie on the interface of 3 or more outcomes is large. To the best of our knowledge our result is the first isoperimetric result to establish interface of more than two bodies.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Chalmers University of Technology", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Chalmers University of Technology", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Chair at the He ... usalem, Israel"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Marcus Isaksson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isaksson:Marcus", "Guy Kindler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kindler:Guy", "Elchanan Mossel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mossel:Elchanan"], "pages": 10}
