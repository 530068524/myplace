It aims to facilitate inter-generational cultural communication by enabling young and old to interact and explore ancient Asian cultural heritage. The system uses new media to revive and model these historical philosophies and teachings, presenting them in new contexts, such as online social chat, music and food. This enables people to experience and explore ancient culture using the literacy of digital interactivity.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Adrian David Cheok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheok:Adrian_David", "Khoo Eng Tat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tat:Khoo_Eng", "Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0009:Wei", "Xiaoming Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Xiaoming", "Peter Marini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marini:Peter", "Xiao Yuan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiao_Yuan"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2008", "pages": 1}
