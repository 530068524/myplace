{"title": "Deep Feature Interpolation for Image Content Changes.", "fields": ["iterative reconstruction", "deep learning", "network architecture", "linear interpolation", "interpolation"], "abstract": "We propose Deep Feature Interpolation (DFI), a new data-driven baseline for automatic high-resolution image transformation. As the name suggests, DFI relies only on simple linear interpolation of deep convolutional features from pre-trained convnets. We show that despite its simplicity, DFI can perform high-level semantic transformations like make older/younger, make bespectacled, add smile, among others, surprisingly well\u2013sometimes even matching or outperforming the state-of-the-art. This is particularly unexpected as DFI requires no specialized network architecture or even any deep network to be trained for these tasks. DFI therefore can be used as a new baseline to evaluate more complex algorithms and provides a practical answer to the question of which image transformation tasks are still challenging after the advent of deep learning.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Cornell University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Paul Upchurch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Upchurch:Paul", "Jacob R.
