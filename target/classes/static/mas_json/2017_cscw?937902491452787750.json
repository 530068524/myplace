This paper presents qualities of effort investment that are seen to be valuable. Furthermore, we consider how these qualities might sensitise designers of communication technologies to the meaningfulness of effort. We report a qualitative study focusing on individual descriptions of meaningful effort invested into everyday correspondence. We encapsulate our findings in the form of five qualities that characterise valued effort: discretionary investment, personal craft, focused time, responsiveness to the recipient, and challenge to a sender's capacities. Drawing on ideas generated in brainstorming sessions, we present two illustrative concepts for new communication technologies, highlighting how our findings can guide the creation of designed artefacts.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Bath", "Open University", "University of Bath", "University of Bath"], "authors": ["Ryan Kelly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelly:Ryan", "Daniel Gooch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gooch:Daniel", "Bhagyashree Patil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patil:Bhagyashree", "Leon Watts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watts:Leon"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
