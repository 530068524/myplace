{"title": "Discriminatively Trained Sparse Code Gradients for Contour Detection.", "fields": ["operator", "neural coding", "sparse approximation", "rgb color model", "matching pursuit"], "abstract": "Finding contours in natural images is a fundamental problem that serves as the basis of many tasks such as image segmentation and object recognition. At the core of contour detection technologies are a set of hand-designed gradient features, used by most approaches including the state-of-the-art Global Pb (gPb) operator. In this work, we show that contour detection accuracy can be significantly improved by computing Sparse Code Gradients (SCG), which measure contrast using patch representations automatically learned through sparse coding. We use K-SVD for dictionary learning and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for computing sparse codes on oriented local neighborhoods, and apply multi-scale pooling and power transforms before classifying them with linear SVMs. By extracting rich representations from pixels and avoiding collapsing them prematurely, Sparse Code Gradients effectively learn how to measure local contrasts and find contours. We improve the F-measure metric on the BSDS500 benchmark to 0.74 (up from 0.71 of gPb contours). Moreover, our learning approach can easily adapt to novel sensor data such as Kinect-style RGB-D cameras: Sparse Code Gradients on depth maps and surface normals lead to promising contour detection using depth and depth+color, as verified on the NYU Depth Dataset.", "citation": "Citations (152)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Xiaofeng Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Xiaofeng", "Liefeng Bo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bo:Liefeng"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
