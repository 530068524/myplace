{"title": "Distributed Explicit State Model Checking of Deadlock Freedom.", "fields": ["ctl", "deadlock", "liveness", "enumeration", "deadlock prevention algorithms"], "abstract": "This paper presents a practical method and associated tool for verifying deadlock freedom properties in guarded command systems. Such properties are expressed in CTL as AGEFi\u00be? q where q is a set of quiescent states. We require the user to provide transitions of the system that are \"helpful\" in reaching quiescent states. The distributed search constructs a path consisting of helpful transitions from each reachable state to a state that is either quiescent or is known to have a path to a quiescent state. We extended the PReach model-checker with these algorithms. Performance measurements on both academic and industrial large-scale models shows that the overhead of checking deadlock-freedom compared with state-space enumeration alone is small.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "Intel", "Intel", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Brad D.
