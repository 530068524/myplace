{"title": "Efficient Query Processing on Many-core Architectures: A Case Study with Intel Xeon Phi Processor.", "fields": ["parallel database", "online analytical processing", "x86", "query optimization", "xeon phi"], "abstract": "Recently, Intel Xeon Phi is emerging as a many-core processor with up to 61 x86 cores. In this demonstration, we present PhiDB, an OLAP query processor with simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) capabilities on Xeon Phi as a case study for parallel database performance on future many-core processors. With the trend towards many-core architectures, query operator optimizations, and efficient query scheduling on such many-core architectures remain as challenging issues. This motivates us to redesign and evaluate query processors. In PhiDB, we apply Xeon Phi aware optimizations on query operators to exploit hardware features of Xeon Phi, and design a heuristic algorithm to schedule the concurrent execution of query operators for better performance, to demonstrate the performance impact of Xeon Phi aware optimizations. We have also developed a user interface for users to explore the underlying performance impacts of hardware-conscious optimizations and scheduling plans.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Huawei", "Nanyang Technological University", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Xuntao Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xuntao", "Bingsheng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Bingsheng", "Mian Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Mian", "Chiew Tong Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Chiew_Tong", "Huynh Phung Huynh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huynh:Huynh_Phung", "Rick Siow Mong Goh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goh:Rick_Siow_Mong"], "pages": 4}
