In particular, we define a relaxed version of the partition bound of Jain and Klauck [Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE 25th Annual Conference on Computational Complexity, 2010, pp. 247--258] and prove that it lower bounds the information complexity of any function. Our relaxed partition bound subsumes all norm-based methods (e.g., the $\\gamma_2$ method) and rectangle-based methods (e.g., the rectangle/corruption bound, the smooth rectangle bound, and the discrepancy bound), except the partition bound. Our result uses a new connection between rectangles and zero-communication protocols, where the players can either output a value or abort. We prove, using a sampling protocol designed by Braverman and Weinstein [in Approximation, Randomization, and Combinatorial Optimization, Lecture Notes in Comput.
