{"title": "Charm: A Language for Closed-Form High-Level Architecture Modeling.", "fields": ["microarchitecture", "design space exploration", "high level architecture", "memoization", "speedup"], "abstract": "As computer architecture continues to expand beyond software-agnostic microarchitecture to data center organization, reconfigurable logic, heterogeneous systems, application-specific logic, and even radically different technologies such as quantum computing, detailed cycle-level simulation is no longer presupposed. Exploring designs under such complex interacting relationships (e.g., performance, energy, thermal, cost, voltage, frequency, cooling energy, leakage, etc.) calls for a more integrative but higher-level approach. We propose Charm, a domain specific language supporting Closed-form High-level ARchitecture Modeling. Charm enables mathematical representations of mutually dependent architectural relationships to be specified, composed, checked, evaluated and reused. The language is interpreted through a combination of symbolic evaluation (e.g., restructuring) and compiler techniques (e.g., memoization and invariant hoisting), generating executable evaluation functions and optimized analysis procedures. Further supporting reuse, a type system constrains architectural quantities and ensures models operate only in a validated domain. Through two case studies, we demonstrate that Charm allows one to define high-level architecture models concisely, maximize reusability, capture unreasonable assumptions and inputs, and significantly speedup design space exploration.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of Chicago", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of Chicago", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "authors": ["Weilong Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Weilong", "Yongshan Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Yongshan", "Deeksha Dangwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dangwal:Deeksha", "Adam Holmes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holmes:Adam", "Joseph McMahan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McMahan:Joseph", "Ali JavadiAbhari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/JavadiAbhari:Ali", "Georgios Tzimpragos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tzimpragos:Georgios", "Frederic T.
