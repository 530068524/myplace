A state-of-the-art algorithm is the rank-one matrix pursuit (R1MP). However, it can only be used in matrix completion problems with the square loss. In this paper, we develop a more flexible greedy algorithm for generalized low-rank models whose optimization objective can be smooth or nonsmooth, general convex or strongly convex. The proposed algorithm has low per-iteration time complexity and fast convergence rate. Experimental results show that it is much faster than the state-of-the-art, with comparable or even better prediction performance.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Quanming Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Quanming", "James T.
