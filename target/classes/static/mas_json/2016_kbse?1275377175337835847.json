{"title": "An automated collaborative requirements engineering tool for better validation of requirements.", "fields": ["requirement", "requirements elicitation", "requirements management", "requirements traceability", "business requirements"], "abstract": "This demo introduces an automated collaborative requirements engineering tool, called TestMEReq, which is used to promote effective communication and collaboration between client-stakeholders and requirements engineers for better requirements validation. Our tool is augmented with real time communication and collaboration support to allow multiple stakeholders to collaboratively validate the same set of requirements. We have conducted a user study focusing on validating requirements using TestMEReq with a few groups of requirements engineers and client stakeholders. The study shows that our automated tool support is able to assist requirements engineers to effectively communicate with client-stakeholders to better validate the requirements virtually in real time.
