The system involves scheduling executions of contract algorithms (which offer a trade-off between allowable computation time and quality of the solution) in m identical parallel processors. When an interruption occurs, the system must report a solution to each of the n problem instances. The quality of this output is then compared to the best-possible algorithm that has foreknowledge of the interruption time and must, likewise, produce solutions to all n problem instances. This extends the well-studied setting in which only one problem instance is queried at interruption time. We propose a schedule which we prove is optimal for the case of a single processor. For multiple processors, we show that the quality of the schedule is within a small factor from optimal.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Spyros Angelopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angelopoulos_0001:Spyros", "Alejandro L\u00f3pez-Ortiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=oacute=pez=Ortiz:Alejandro"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 7}
