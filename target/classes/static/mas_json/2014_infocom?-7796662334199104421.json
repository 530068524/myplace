Under protocol interference model, it is NP-hard even when all nodes have uniform (and fixed) interference radii and the positions of all nodes are available. On one hand, it admits a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS). In other words, for any fixed \ufffd\ufffd > 0, it has a polynomial-time (depending on \ufffd\ufffd ) (1 + \ufffd\ufffd )-approximation algorithm. However, such PTAS is of theoretical interest only and is quite infeasible practically. On the other hand, only with the uniform interference radii is a simple (greedy) constant-approximation algorithm known. For the arbitrary interference radii, fast constant-approximation algorithms are still missing. In this paper, we present a number of fast and simple approximation algorithms under the general protocol interference model. When applied to the plane geometric variants of the protocol interference model, these algorithms produce constant-approximate solutions efficiently.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "City University of Hong Kong", "Hangzhou Dianzi University", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Georgetown University"], "authors": ["Peng-Jun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Peng=Jun", "Xiaohua Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Xiaohua", "Guojun Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Guojun", "Hongwei Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Hongwei", "Ophir Frieder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frieder:Ophir"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
