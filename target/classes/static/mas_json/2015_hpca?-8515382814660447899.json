Multithreading can Increase contention for various system resources, however, that may result In suboptimal utilization of shared resources. Previous research has proposed variants of throttling thread-level parallelism to reduce cache contention and improve performance. Throttling approaches can, however, lead to under-utilizing thread contexts, on-chip interconnect, and off-chip memory bandwidth. This paper proposes to tightly couple the thread scheduling mechanism with the cache management algorithms such that GPU cache pollution is minimized while off-chip memory throughput is enhanced. We propose priority-based cache allocation (PCAL) that provides preferential cache capacity to a subset of high-priority threads while simultaneously allowing lower priority threads to execute without contending for the cache. By tuning thread-level parallelism while both optimizing caching efficiency as well as other shared resource usage, PCAL builds upon previous thread throttling approaches, improving overall performance by an average 17% with maximum 51%.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Nvidia", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Dong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dong", "Minsoo Rhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rhu:Minsoo", "Daniel R.
