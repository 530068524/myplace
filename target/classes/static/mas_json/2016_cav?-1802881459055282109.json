To reduce cost in checking every revision, contextual assumptions are reused from assume-guarantee reasoning. However, contextual assumptions are not always reusable. We propose a fine-grained learning technique to maximize the reuse of contextual assumptions. Based on fine-grained learning, we develop a regressional assume-guarantee verification approach for evolving systems. We have implemented a prototype of our approach and conducted extensive experiments (with 1018 verification tasks). The results suggest promising outlooks for our incremental technique.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Academia Sinica"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Fei He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Fei", "Shu Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Shu", "Bow-Yaw Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Bow=Yaw"], "pages": 19}
