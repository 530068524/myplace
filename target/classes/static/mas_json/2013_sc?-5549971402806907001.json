{"title": "Enabling fair pricing on HPC systems with node sharing.", "fields": ["operator", "runtime system", "throughput", "shared resource", "mean absolute error"], "abstract": "Co-location, where multiple jobs share compute nodes in large-scale HPC systems, has been shown to increase aggregate throughput and energy efficiency by 10 to 20%. However, system operators disallow co-location due to fair-pricing concerns, i.e., a pricing mechanism that considers performance interference from co-running jobs. In the current pricing model, application execution time determines the price, which results in unfair prices paid by the minority of users whose jobs suffer from co-location.   This paper presents POPPA, a runtime system that enables fair pricing by delivering precise online interference detection and facilitates the adoption of supercomputers with co-locations. POPPA leverages a novel shutter mechanism -- a cyclic, fine-grained interference sampling mechanism to accurately deduce the interference between co-runners -- to provide unbiased pricing of jobs that share nodes. POPPA is able to quantify inter-application interference within 4% mean absolute error on a variety of co-located benchmark and real scientific workloads.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "San Diego Supercomputer Center", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "San Diego Supercomputer Center", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Alex D.
