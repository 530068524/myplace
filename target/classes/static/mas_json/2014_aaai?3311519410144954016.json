{"title": "Dynamic Multi-Agent Task Allocation with Spatial and Temporal Constraints.", "fields": ["heuristic", "distributed computing", "schedule", "law enforcement", "real time computing", "computer science", "polynomial", "pareto principle"], "abstract": "Realistic multi-agent team applications often feature dynamic environments with soft deadlines that penalize late execution of tasks. This puts a premium on quickly allocating tasks to agents, but finding the optimal allocation is NP-hard due to temporal and spatial constraints that require tasks to be executed sequentially by agents.\n\nWe propose FMC TA, a novel task allocation algorithm that allows tasks to be easily sequenced to yield high-quality solutions. FMC_TA first finds allocations that are fair (envyfree), balancing the load and sharing important tasks between agents, and efficient (Pareto optimal) in a simplified version of the problem. It computes such allocations in polynomial or pseudo-polynomial time (centrally or distributedly, respectively) using a Fisher market with agents as buyers and tasks as goods. It then heuristically schedules the allocations, taking into account inter-agent constraints on shared tasks.\n\nWe empirically compare our algorithm to state-of-the-art incomplete methods, both centralized and distributed, on law enforcement problems inspired by real police logs. The results show a clear advantage for FMC TA both in total utility and in other measures commonly used by law enforcement authorities.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Sofia Amador.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amador:Sofia", "Steven Okamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okamoto:Steven", "Roie Zivan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zivan:Roie"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
