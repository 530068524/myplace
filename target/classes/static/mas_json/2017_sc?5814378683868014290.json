PapyrusKV stores keys with their values in arbitrary byte arrays across multiple NVMs in a distributed system. PapyrusKV provides standard KVS operations such as put, get, and delete. More importantly, PapyrusKV provides advanced features for HPC such as dynamic consistency control, zero-copy workflow, and asynchronous checkpoint/restart. Beyond filesystems, PapyrusKV provides HPC programmers with a high-level interface to exploit distributed NVM in the system, and it transparently organizes data to achieve high performance. Also, it allows HPC applications to specialize PapyrusKV to meet their specific requirements. We empirically evaluate PapyrusKV on three HPC systems with real NVM devices: OLCF's Summitdev, TACC's Stampede, and NERSC's Cori. Our results show that PapyrusKV can offer high performance, scalability, and portability across these various distributed NVM architectures.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Jungwon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jungwon", "Seyong Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Seyong", "Jeffrey S.
