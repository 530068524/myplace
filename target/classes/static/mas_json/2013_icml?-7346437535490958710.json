A number of emerging techniques specifically include a codebook learning step, in which a critical knowledge abstraction process is carried out. Existing approaches in dictionary (codebook) learning are either generative (unsupervised e.g. k-means) or discriminative (supervised e.g. extremely randomized forests). In this paper, we propose a multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy (along the line of weakly supervised learning) for dictionary learning. Each code is represented by a classifier, such as a linear SVM, which naturally performs metric fusion for multi-channel features. We design a formulation to simultaneously learn mixtures of codes by maximizing classification margins in MIL. State-of-the-art results are observed in image classification benchmarks based on the learned codebooks, which observe both compactness and effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Microsoft", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Xinggang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinggang", "Baoyuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Baoyuan", "Xiang Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Xiang", "Wenyu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wenyu", "Zhuowen Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Zhuowen"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
