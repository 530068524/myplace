Substantial research on locality-aware designs have thus focused on keeping a copy of the data private. However, this complicatesthe problem of data tracking and search/invalidation; tracking the state of a line at all on-chip caches at a directory or performing full-chip broadcasts are both non-scalable and extremely expensive solutions. In this paper, we make the case for Locality-Oblivious Cache Organization (LOCO), a CMP cache organization that leverages the on-chip network to create virtual single-cycle paths between distant caches, thus redefining the notion of locality. LOCO is a clustered cache organization, supporting both homogeneous and heterogeneous cluster sizes, and provides near single-cycle accesses to data anywhere within the cluster, just like a private cache. Globally, LOCO dynamically creates a virtual mesh connecting all the clusters, and performs an efficient global data search and migration over this virtual mesh, without having to resort to full-chip broadcasts or perform expensive directory lookups. Trace-driven and full system simulations running SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmarks show that LOCO improves application run time by up to 44.5% over baseline private and shared cache.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Intel", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Woo-Cheol Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Woo=Cheol", "Tushar Krishna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishna:Tushar", "Li-Shiuan Peh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peh:Li=Shiuan"], "pages": 14}
