{"title": "Growing a bag of systems tree for fast and accurate classification.", "fields": ["codebook", "contextual image classification", "tree structure", "search engine indexing", "image texture"], "abstract": "The bag-of-systems (BoS) representation is a descriptor of motion in a video, where dynamic texture (DT) codewords represent the typical motion patterns in spatio-temporal patches extracted from the video. The efficacy of the BoS descriptor depends on the richness of the codebook, which directly depends on the number of codewords in the codebook. However, for even modest sized codebooks, mapping videos onto the codebook results in a heavy computational load. In this paper we propose the BoS Tree, which constructs a bottom-up hierarchy of codewords that enables efficient mapping of videos to the BoS codebook. By leveraging the tree structure to efficiently index the codewords, the BoS Tree allows for fast look-ups in the codebook and enables the practical use of larger, richer codebooks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BoS Trees on classification of three video datasets, as well as on annotation of a music dataset.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Emanuele Coviello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coviello:Emanuele", "Adeel Mumtaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mumtaz:Adeel", "Antoni B.
