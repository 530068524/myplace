However, meta-knowledge on\nthe system\u2019s behavior is often given and should\nbe exploited: Stability as fundamental property\nis essential when the model is used for controller\ndesign or movement generation. Therefore, this\npaper proposes a framework for learning stable\nstochastic systems from data. We focus on\nidentifying a state-dependent coefficient form of\nthe nonlinear stochastic model which is globally\nasymptotically stable according to probabilistic\nLyapunov methods. We compare our approach\nto other state of the art methods on real-world\ndatasets in terms of flexibility and stability.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jonas Umlauft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Umlauft:Jonas", "Sandra Hirche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirche:Sandra"], "pages": 9}
