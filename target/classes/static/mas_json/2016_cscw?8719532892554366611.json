{"title": "Finding Weather Photos: Community-Supervised Methods for Editorial Curation of Online Sources.", "fields": ["implementation", "multimodal therapy", "metadata", "discoverability", "human centered computing"], "abstract": "There are many cues that can be used to curate media from social networking websites. Beyond metadata, group behavior provide a strong community-based signal for surfacing images, which we show in a user-defined curatorial task. In a departure from mirco-task crowdwork, we observe that the curation inherent in online photo communities guides the discoverability and consumption of the media, which in turn provides a strong signal that can be used in new editorial tasks in a community-supervised manner. We use this approach in tandem with other more conventional multimedia methods (i.e.\\ computer vision and contextual metadata) to form a broad multimodal approach to retrieval and recommendation. We present a large-scale system implementation on a real-world curative task for weather images on a web-scale dataset. Finally, we conduct an evaluation of this system using professional editors and find substantial improvements in editorial efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Snapchat"], "authors": ["David A.
