Through the crowdsourcing platform, service requesters can buy service from service providers. An important component of crowdsourcing is its incentive mechanism. We study three models of crowdsourcing, which involve cooperation and competition among the service providers. Our simplest model generalizes the well-known user-centric model studied in a recent Mobicom paper. We design an incentive mechanism for each of the three models, and prove that these incentive mechanisms are individually rational, budget-balanced, computationally efficient, and truthful.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Colorado School of Mines", "Syracuse University"], "authors": ["Xiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Xiang", "Guoliang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Guoliang", "Ruozhou Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Ruozhou", "Dejun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Dejun", "Jian Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0008:Jian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
