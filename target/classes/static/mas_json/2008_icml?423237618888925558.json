Our contribution is that we reduce this classification problem to the problem of finding a rule-based classifier with appropriate weights. We show that these rules and weights can be computed in linear time from the output of a modified frequent itemset mining algorithm, which means that we can compute the classifier in practice, despite the exponential worst-case complexity. In experiments we compare the Bayes optimal predictions with those of the maximum a posteriori hypothesis.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Siegfried Nijssen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nijssen:Siegfried"], "pages": 8}
