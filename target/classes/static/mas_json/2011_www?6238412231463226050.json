In this paper, we show that the information contained in  interest networks  (i.e. user-service interactions) and  friendship networks  (i.e. user-user connections) is highly correlated and mutually helpful. We propose a framework that exploits homophily to establish an integrated network linking a user to interested services and connecting different users with common interests, upon which both friendship and interests could be efficiently propagated. The proposed  friendship-interest propagation  (FIP) framework devises a factor-based random walk model to explain friendship connections, and simultaneously it uses a coupled latent factor model to uncover interest interactions. We discuss the flexibility of the framework in the choices of loss objectives and regularization penalties and benchmark different variants on the Yahoo! Pulse social networking system. Experiments demonstrate that by coupling friendship with interest, FIP achieves much higher performance on both  interest targeting  and  friendship prediction  than systems using only one source of information.", "citation": "Citations (365)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Shuang-Hong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shuang=Hong", "Bo Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Bo", "Alexander J.
