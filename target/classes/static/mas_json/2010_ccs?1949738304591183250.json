As a result, key compromises have put millions of software update clients at risk. Here we identify three classes of information whose authenticity and integrity are critical for secure software updates. Analyzing existing software update systems with our framework, we find their ability to communicate this information securely in the event of a key compromise to be weak or nonexistent. We also find that the security problems in current software update systems are compounded by inadequate trust revocation mechanisms. We identify core security principles that allow software update systems to survive key compromise. Using these ideas, we design and implement TUF, a software update framework that increases resilience to key compromise.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "The Tor Project", "University of Washington", "The Tor Project"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Justin Samuel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samuel:Justin", "Nick Mathewson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mathewson:Nick", "Justin Cappos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cappos:Justin", "Roger Dingledine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dingledine:Roger"], "pages": 12}
