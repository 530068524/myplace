To examine this, we report on how the production practices and process are conducted through an empirical study of the production of live television, involving the use of live and non-live media under highly time critical conditions. In explaining how this process is managed both as an individual and collective activity, we develop the concept of temporal hybridity to explain the properties of these kinds of production system and show how temporally separated media are used, understood and coordinated. Our analysis is examined in the light of recent developments in computing technology and we present some design implications to support amateur video production.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Brunel University London", "Link\u00f6ping University", "Mobile Life, In ... ockholm, Sweden", "Mobile Life, In ... ockholm, Sweden"], "authors": ["Arvid Engstr\u00f6m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Engstr=ouml=m:Arvid", "Oskar Juhlin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juhlin:Oskar", "Mark J.
