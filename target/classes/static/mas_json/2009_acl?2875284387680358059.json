{"title": "Jointly Identifying Temporal Relations with Markov Logic.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "logic model", "machine learning", "afnlp", "markov chain", "pairwise comparison"], "abstract": "Recent work on temporal relation identification has focused on three types of relations between events: temporal relations between an event and a time expression, between a pair of events and between an event and the document creation time. These types of relations have mostly been identified in isolation by event pairwise comparison. However, this approach neglects logical constraints between temporal relations of different types that we believe to be helpful. We therefore propose a Markov Logic model that jointly identifies relations of all three relation types simultaneously. By evaluating our model on the TempEval data we show that this approach leads to about 2% higher accuracy for all three types of relations -and to the best results for the task when compared to those of other machine learning based systems. \u00a9 2009 ACL and AFNLP.", "citation": "Citations (136)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "NAIST, Japan", "NAIST, Japan", "NAIST, Japan"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Katsumasa Yoshikawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshikawa:Katsumasa", "Sebastian Riedel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riedel_0001:Sebastian", "Masayuki Asahara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asahara:Masayuki", "Yuji Matsumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsumoto_0001:Yuji"], "pages": 9}
