{"title": "PinDr0p: using single-ended audio features to determine call provenance.", "fields": ["voice over ip", "call control", "call management", "packet loss", "3pcc"], "abstract": "The recent diversification of telephony infrastructure allows users to communicate through landlines, mobile phones and VoIP phones. However, call metadata such as Caller-ID is either not transferred or transferred without verification across these networks, allowing attackers to maliciously alter it. In this paper, we develop PinDr0p, a mechanism to assist users in determining call provenance - the source and the path taken by a call. Our techniques detect and measure single-ended audio features to identify all of the applied voice codecs, calculate packet loss and noise profiles, while remaining agnostic to characteristics of the speaker's voice (as this may legitimately change when interacting with a large organization). In the absence of verifiable call metadata, these features in combination with machine learning allow us to determine the traversal of a call through as many as three different providers (e.g., cellular, then VoIP, then PSTN and all combinations and subsets thereof) with 91.6% accuracy. Moreover, we show that once we identify and characterize the networks traversed, we can create detailed fingerprints for a call source. Using these fingerprints we show that we are able to distinguish between calls made using specific PSTN, cellular, Vonage, Skype and other hard and soft phones from locations across the world with over 90% accuracy. In so doing, we provide a first step in accurately determining the provenance of a call.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Vijay A.
