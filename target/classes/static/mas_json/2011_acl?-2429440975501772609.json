{"title": "Nonlinear Evidence Fusion and Propagation for Hyponymy Relation Mining.", "fields": ["performance improvement", "pattern matching", "web page", "fusion", "statistical model"], "abstract": "This paper focuses on mining the hyponymy (or is-a) relation from large-scale, open-domain web documents. A nonlinear probabilistic model is exploited to model the correlation between sentences in the aggregation of pattern matching results. Based on the model, we design a set of evidence combination and propagation algorithms. These significantly improve the result quality of existing approaches. Experimental results conducted on 500 million web pages and hypernym labels for 300 terms show over 20% performance improvement in terms of P@5, MAP and R-Precision.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Nankai University", "Microsoft", "Nankai University", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Fan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Fan", "Shuming Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Shuming", "Jing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jing", "Shuqi Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Shuqi", "Chin-Yew Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chin=Yew"], "pages": 10}
