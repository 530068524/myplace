We apply it to solve the  operator scaling  problem in time polynomial in the input size and  logarithmic  in the error. This is an exponential improvement over previous algorithms which were analyzed in the usual Euclidean, \"commutative\" metric (for which the above problem is not convex). Our method is general and applicable to other settings.     As a consequence, we solve the  equivalence  problem for the left-right group action underlying the operator scaling problem. This yields a  deterministic  polynomial-time algorithm for a new class of Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) problems, which was the original motivation for studying operator scaling.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Princeton University", "University of Toronto", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Zeyuan Allen-Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Allen=Zhu:Zeyuan", "Ankit Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Ankit", "Yuanzhi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuanzhi", "Rafael Mendes de Oliveira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliveira:Rafael_Mendes_de", "Avi Wigderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigderson:Avi"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
