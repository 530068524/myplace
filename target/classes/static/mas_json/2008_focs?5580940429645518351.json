This improves on prior results that obtain suboptimal space bounds in the general model, and near-optimal bounds in the insertion-only model without sketching. Our high-level approach is simple: we give algorithms to estimate Tsallis entropy, and use them to extrapolate an estimate of Shannon entropy. The accuracy of our estimates is proven using approximation theory arguments and extremal properties of Chebyshev polynomials. Our work also yields the best-known and near-optimal additive approximations for entropy, and hence also for conditional entropy and mutual information.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Nicholas J.
