Our formulation captures the notion of deviation from being balanced by a convex penalty function. While this formulation admits a convex programming solution, we strive for more robust and scalable algorithms.   For the case of  L  1  penalty functions we obtain a simple combinatorial algorithm based on min-cost flow in graphs and show how to precompute a  linear  amount of information such that the allocation along any edge can be approximated in  constant  time. We then extend our combinatorial solution to any convex function by solving a convex cost flow. These scalable methods may have applications in other contexts stipulating balanced allocation.   We study the performance of our algorithms on large real-world graphs and show that they are efficient, scalable, and robust in practice.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Yahoo!", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Saeed Alaei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alaei:Saeed", "Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Ravi", "Azarakhsh Malekian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malekian:Azarakhsh", "Erik Vee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vee:Erik"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
