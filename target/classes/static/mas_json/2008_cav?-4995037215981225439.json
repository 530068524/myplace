Of these, the one with the best time complexity exploits the representation of the simulation problem as a generalised coarsest partition problem. It is based on a fixed-point operator for obtaining a generalised coarsest partition as the limit of a sequence of partition pairs. We show that this fixed-point theory is flawed, and that the algorithm is incorrect. Although we do not see how the fixed-point operator can be repaired, we correct the algorithm without affecting its space and time complexity.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Rob J. van Glabbeek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glabbeek:Rob_J=_van", "Bas Ploeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ploeger:Bas"], "pages": 13}
