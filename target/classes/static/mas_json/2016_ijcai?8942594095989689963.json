{"title": "Answering Metaqueries over Hi (OWL 2 QL) Ontologies.", "fields": ["abox", "conjunctive query", "web ontology language", "metamodeling", "ontology language"], "abstract": "Hi (OWL 2 QL) is a new ontology language with the OWL 2 QL syntax and a specific semantics designed to support metamodeling and metaquerying. In this paper we investigate the problem of answering metaqueries in Hi(OWL 2 QL), which are unions of conjunctive queries with both ABox and TBox atoms. We first focus on a specific class of ontologies, called TBox-complete, where there is no uncertainty about TBox axioms, and show that query answering in this case has the same complexity (both data and combined) as in OWL 2 QL. We then move to general ontologies and show that answering metaqueries is coNP-complete with respect to ontology complexity, \u03a02p-complete with respect to combined complexity, and remains AC0 with respect to ABox complexity. Finally, we present an optimized query answering algorithm that can be used for TBox-complete ontologies.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Dipartimento di ... ersit\u00e0 di Roma", "Dipartimento di ...  e Geografiche", "Dipartimento di ... ersit\u00e0 di Roma"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Maurizio Lenzerini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lenzerini:Maurizio", "Lorenzo Lepore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepore:Lorenzo", "Antonella Poggi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poggi:Antonella"], "pages": 7}
