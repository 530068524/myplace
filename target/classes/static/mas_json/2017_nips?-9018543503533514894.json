{"title": "Expectation Propagation for t-Exponential Family Using q-Algebra.", "fields": ["natural exponential family", "expectation propagation", "location scale family", "additive function", "parametric family"], "abstract": "Exponential family distributions are highly useful in machine learning since their calculation can be performed efficiently through natural parameters. The exponential family has recently been extended to the t-exponential family, which contains Student-t distributions as family members and thus allows us to handle noisy data well. However, since the t-exponential family is defined by the deformed exponential, an efficient learning algorithm for the t-exponential family such as expectation propagation (EP) cannot be derived in the same way as the ordinary exponential family. In this paper, we borrow the mathematical tools of q-algebra from statistical physics and show that the pseudo additivity of distributions allows us to perform calculation of t-exponential family distributions through natural parameters. We then develop an expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for the t-exponential family, which provides a deterministic approximation to the posterior or predictive distribution with simple moment matching. We finally apply the proposed EP algorithm to the Bayes point machine and Student-t process classification, and demonstrate their performance numerically.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Futoshi Futami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Futami:Futoshi", "Issei Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Issei", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "pages": 10}
