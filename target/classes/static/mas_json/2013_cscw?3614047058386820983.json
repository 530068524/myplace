{"title": "Come drive with me: an ethnographic study of driver-passenger pairs to inform future in-car assistance.", "fields": ["automotive industry", "common ground", "user interface", "human computer interaction", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "There is today a large number of ADAS used while driving. These systems are mainly technology driven and most often fail to make use of the social nature and the collaborative mechanisms between driver-passenger pairs. To inform the development of future automotive user interface designs we need to develop a deeper understanding of collaboration in general. In addition, we need to develop an understanding of how, and in what way, other platforms (e.g., the mobile phones) are and will be used in combination with these systems while driving. This paper presents the results of a participative ethnographic study with nine driver-passenger pairs recruited from two online car-sharing portals. Results are categorized in three areas:  common ground as a base for successful in-car communication, types and strategies of front-seat passenger assistance , and lastly  the impact of technology on collaboration .", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg"], "authors": ["Nicole Perterer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perterer:Nicole", "Petra Sundstr\u00f6m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundstr=ouml=m:Petra", "Alexander Meschtscherjakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meschtscherjakov:Alexander", "David Wilfinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilfinger:David", "Manfred Tscheligi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tscheligi:Manfred"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
