{"title": "Evaluating aggregated search pages.", "fields": ["performance metric", "fidelity", "data mining", "computer science", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Aggregating search results from a variety of heterogeneous sources or  verticals  such as news, image and video into a single interface is a popular paradigm in web search. Although various approaches exist for selecting relevant verticals or optimising the aggregated search result page, evaluating the quality of an aggregated page is an open question.   This paper proposes a general framework for evaluating the quality of aggregated search pages. We evaluate our approach by collecting annotated user preferences over a set of aggregated search pages for 56 topics and 12 verticals. We empirically demonstrate the fidelity of metrics instantiated from our proposed framework by showing that they strongly agree with the annotated user preferences of pairs of simulated aggregated pages.   Furthermore, we show that our metrics agree with the majority preference more often than current diversity-based information retrieval metrics. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by showing that personalised historical preference data can be used to improve the performance of our proposed metrics.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "National University of Ireland, Galway", "Yahoo!", "University of Glasgow"], "authors": ["Ke Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Ke", "Ronan Cummins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cummins:Ronan", "Mounia Lalmas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lalmas:Mounia", "Joemon M.
