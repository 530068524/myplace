As the data movement across machines is often a significant bottleneck, these systems typically use a low-latency, high-throughput network such as InfiniBand. To achieve the necessary performance, parallel join algorithms must take advantage of the primitives provided by the network to speed up data transfer.   In this paper we focus on implementing parallel in-memory joins using Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), a communication mechanism to transfer data directly into the memory of a remote machine. The results of this paper are, to our knowledge, the first detailed analysis of parallel hash joins using RDMA. To capture their behavior independently of the network characteristics, we develop an analytical model and test our implementation on two different types of networks. The experimental results show that the model is accurate and the resulting distributed join exhibits good performance.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Claude Barthels.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthels:Claude", "Simon Loesing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loesing:Simon", "Gustavo Alonso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alonso:Gustavo", "Donald Kossmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kossmann:Donald"], "pages": 13}
