In this paper, we present GestKeyboard, a novel technique for gesturing over an ordinary, unmodified physical keyboard - that remains the major input modality for existing desktop and laptop computers. We discuss an exploratory study for understanding the design space of gesturing on a physical keyboard and our algorithms for detecting gestures in a modeless way, without interfering with the keyboard's major functionality such as text entry and shortcuts activation. We explored various features for detecting gestures from a keyboard event stream. Our experiment based on the data collected from 10 participants indicated it is feasible to reliably detect gestures from normal keyboard use, 95% detection accuracy within a maximum latency of 200ms.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Google"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Haimo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haimo", "Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yang"], "pages": 10}
