This settles the question of designing asymptotically optimal spectral algorithms for balanced separator. Our algorithm relies on a variant of the heat kernel random walk and requires, as a subroutine, an algorithm to compute exp(-L)v where L is the Laplacian of a graph related to G and v is a vector. Algorithms for computing the matrix-exponential-vector product efficiently comprise our next set of results. Our main result here is a new algorithm which computes a good approximation to exp(-A)v for a class of symmetric positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices A and a given vector v, in time roughly ~O(m A ), independent of the norm of A, where m A  is the number of non-zero entries of A. This uses, in a non-trivial way, the result of Spielman and Teng on inverting symmetric and diagonally-dominant matrices in ~O(m A ) time. Finally, using old and new uniform approximations to e -x  we show how to obtain, via the Lanczos method, a simple algorithm to compute exp(-A)v for symmetric PSD matrices that runs in time roughly O(t A \u22c5 \u221anorm(A)), where t A  is the time required for the computation of the vector Aw for given vector w. As an application, we obtain a simple and practical algorithm, with output conductance O(\u221a\u03b3), for balanced separator that runs in time O(m/\u221a\u03b3). This latter algorithm matches the running time, but improves on the approximation guarantee of the Evolving-Sets-based algorithm by Andersen and Peres for balanced separator.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Lorenzo Orecchia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orecchia:Lorenzo", "Sushant Sachdeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sachdeva:Sushant", "Nisheeth K.
