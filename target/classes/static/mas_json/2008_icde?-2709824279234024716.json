{"title": "Managing Biological Data using BDBMS.", "fields": ["database index", "database engine", "data curation", "biological database", "management information systems"], "abstract": "We demonstrate bdbms, an extensible database engine for biological databases, bdbms started on the observation that database technology has not kept pace with the specific requirements of biological databases and that several needed key functionalities are not supported at the engine level. While bdbms aims at supporting several of these functionalities, this demo focuses on: (1) Annotation and provenance management including storage, indexing, querying, and propagation, (2) Local dependency tracking of dependencies and derivations among data items, and (3) Update authorization to support data curation. We demonstrate how bdbms enables biologists to manipulate their databases, annotations, and derivation information in a unified database system using the Purdue ionomics information management system (PiiMS) as a case study.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Mohamed Y.
