{"title": "On Condensing a Sequence of Updates in Answer-Set Programming.", "fields": ["alphabet", "answer set programming", "iterative and incremental development", "negation", "stable model semantics"], "abstract": "Update semantics for Answer-Set Programming assign models to sequences of answer-set programs which result from the iterative process of updating programs by programs. Each program in the sequence represents an update of the preceding ones. One of the enduring problems in this context is state condensing, or the problem of determining a single logic program that faithfully represents the sequence of programs. Such logic program should 1) be written in the same alphabet, 2) have the same stable models, and 3) be equivalent to the sequence of programs when subject to further updates.\n\nIt has been known for more than a decade that update semantics easily lead to non-minimal stable models, so an update sequence cannot be represented by a single non-disjunctive program. On the other hand, more expressive classes of programs were never considered, mainly because it was not clear how they could be updated further.\n\nIn this paper we solve the state condensing problem for two foundational rule update semantics, using nested logic programs. Furthermore, we also show that disjunctive programs with default negation in the head can be used for the same purpose.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Universidade Nova de Lisboa", "Universidade Nova de Lisboa"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Martin Slota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slota:Martin", "Jo\u00e3o Leite.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leite:Jo=atilde=o"], "pages": 7}
