{"title": "Distilling Task Knowledge from How-To Communities.", "fields": ["knowledge based systems", "graph", "cluster analysis", "knowledge base", "search engine"], "abstract": "Knowledge graphs have become a fundamental asset for search engines. A fair amount of user queries seek information on problem-solving tasks such as building a fence or repairing a bicycle. However, knowledge graphs completely lack this kind of how-to knowledge. This paper presents a method for automatically constructing a formal knowledge base on tasks and task-solving steps, by tapping the contents of online communities such as WikiHow. We employ Open-IE techniques to extract noisy candidates for tasks, steps and the required tools and other items. For cleaning and properly organizing this data, we devise embedding-based clustering techniques. The resulting knowledge base, HowToKB, includes a hierarchical taxonomy of disambiguated tasks, temporal orders of sub-tasks, and attributes for involved items. A comprehensive evaluation of HowToKB shows high accuracy. As an extrinsic use case, we evaluate automatically searching related YouTube videos for HowToKB tasks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Allen Institute ... , Seattle, USA"], "authors": ["Cuong Xuan Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Cuong_Xuan", "Niket Tandon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tandon:Niket", "Gerhard Weikum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weikum:Gerhard"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
