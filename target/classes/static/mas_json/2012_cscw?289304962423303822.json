This paper describes a need-driven approach for computer-supported collaborative interaction design, with specific focus on collaboration rooted in early childhood. We conducted a need-identification study, where explicit needs and latent needs in children's collaborative interaction were identified and constructed into a guideline for computer-supported collaboration design. Demonstrating the need-driven approach, a toolkit was designed and the prototype was evaluated based upon the guideline attempting to address the needs identified. The need-driven approach and the design guideline that the toolkit design was based upon may offer new dynamic domains for future computer-supported collaboration design.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sheng-Ying Pao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pao:Sheng=Ying", "Selene Mota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mota:Selene", "Keywon Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Keywon", "Alexander Reben.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reben:Alexander"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
