{"title": "Arrays of (locality-sensitive) Count Estimators (ACE): Anomaly Detection on the Edge.", "fields": ["locality sensitive hashing", "locality", "subroutine", "estimator", "edge computing"], "abstract": "Anomaly detection is one of the frequent and important subroutines deployed in large-scale data processing applications. Even being a well-studied topic, existing techniques for unsupervised anomaly detection require storing significant amounts of data, which is prohibitive from memory and latency perspectives, especially for small mobile devices which has ultra-low memory budget and limited computational power. In this paper, we propose ACE (Arrays of (locality-sensitive) Count Estimators) algorithm that can be 60x faster than most state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. Our experiments show that ACE algorithm has significantly smaller memory footprints (", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Chen Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Chen", "Anshumali Shrivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrivastava:Anshumali"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
