{"title": "Enabling coordinated register allocation and thread-level parallelism optimization for GPUs.", "fields": ["context switch", "thrashing", "register allocation", "task parallelism", "cache"], "abstract": "The key to high performance on GPUs lies in the massive threading to enable thread switching and hide the latency of function unit and memory access. However, running with the maximum thread-level parallelism (TLP) does not necessarily lead to the optimal performance due to the excessive thread contention for cache resource. As a result, thread throttling techniques are employed to limit the number of threads that concurrently execute to preserve the data locality. On the other hand, GPUs are equipped with a large register file to enable fast context switch between threads. However, thread throttling techniques that are designed to mitigate cache contention, lead to under utilization of registers. Register allocation is a significant factor for performance as it not just determines the single-thread performance, but indirectly affects the TLP.   The design space of register allocation and TLP presents new opportunities for performance optimization. However, the complicated correlation between the two factors inevitably lead to many performance dynamics and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose Coordinated Register Allocation and Thread-level parallelism ( CRAT ), a compiler-based performance optimization framework. In order to achieve this goal,  CRAT  first enables effective register allocation. Given a register per-thread limit,  CRAT  allocates the registers by analyzing the lifetime of variables. To reduce the spilling cost,  CRAT  spills the registers to shared memory when possible. Then,  CRAT  explores the design space by first pruning the design points that cause serious Ll cache thrashing and register under utilization. After that,  CRAT  employs a prediction model to find the best tradeoff between the single-thread performance and TLP. We evaluate  CRAT  using a set of representative workloads on GPUs. Experimental results indicate that compared to the optimal thread throttling technique, our framework achieves performance improvement up to 1.79X (geometric mean 1.25X).", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Xiaolong Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Xiaolong", "Yun Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang_0001:Yun", "Xiuhong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiuhong", "Yudong Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yudong", "Guangyu Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Guangyu", "Tao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0004:Tao", "Dongrui Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Dongrui"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
