The proposed approach captures the group-wise interaction information for group images by learning a semantics-aware image representation based on a convolutional neural network, which adaptively learns the group-wise features for co-saliency detection. Furthermore, the proposed approach discovers the collaborative and interactive relationships between group-wise feature representation and single-image individual feature representation, and model this in a collaborative learning framework. Finally, we set up a unified end-to-end deep learning scheme to jointly optimize the process of group-wise feature representation learning and the collaborative learning, leading to more reliable and robust co-saliency detection results. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Lina Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Lina", "Shanshan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shanshan", "Omar El Farouk Bourahla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bourahla:Omar_El_Farouk", "Xi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xi", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
