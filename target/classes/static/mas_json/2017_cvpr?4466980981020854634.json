{"title": "Learning Adaptive Receptive Fields for Deep Image Parsing Network.", "fields": ["receptive field", "kernel", "interpolation", "affine transformation", "parsing"], "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to regulate receptive field in deep image parsing network automatically. Unlike previous works which have stressed much importance on obtaining better receptive fields using manually selected dilated convolutional kernels, our approach uses two affine transformation layers in the networks backbone and operates on feature maps. Feature maps will be inflated/shrinked by the new layer and therefore receptive fields in following layers are changed accordingly. By end-to-end training, the whole framework is data-driven without laborious manual intervention. The proposed method is generic across dataset and different tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on both general parsing task and face parsing task as concrete examples to demonstrate the methods superior regulation ability over manual designs.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Nanjing University of Science and Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Nanjing University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zhen Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Zhen", "Yao Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yao", "Jinqiao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jinqiao", "Hanjiang Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Hanjiang", "Si Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Si"], "pages": 9}
