{"title": "A theory of changes for higher-order languages: incrementalizing \u03bb-calculi by static differentiation.", "fields": ["parameterized complexity", "first class function", "agda", "plug in", "scala"], "abstract": "If the result of an expensive computation is invalidated by a small change to the input, the old result should be updated incrementally instead of reexecuting the whole computation. We incrementalize programs through their  derivative . A derivative maps changes in the program's input directly to changes in the program's output, without reexecuting the original program. We present a program transformation taking programs to their derivatives, which is fully static and automatic, supports first-class functions, and produces derivatives amenable to standard optimization.   We prove the program transformation correct in Agda for a family of simply-typed \u03bb-calculi, parameterized by base types and primitives. A precise interface specifies what is required to incrementalize the chosen primitives.   We investigate performance by a case study: We implement in Scala the program transformation, a plugin and improve performance of a nontrivial program by orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Marburg", "University of Marburg", "University of Marburg", "University of Marburg"], "authors": ["Yufei Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Yufei", "Paolo G.
