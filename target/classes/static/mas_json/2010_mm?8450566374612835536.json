Small and low power devices placed on top of the sheet will be able to receive audio and video signals transmitted from a computer. The 2D sheet is printed in three layers and the electromagnetic waves are distributed in the middle layer. Through a grid of slits printed on the top layer, the electromagnetic waves leak and are thus picked up by small multimedia devices with antennas. Compared to the wired and wireless communication, this 2D sheet has its unique properties such as free to put and move devices on it, power efficient, wide transmission bandwidth, secure communication, etc.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis"], "authors": ["Youiti Kado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kado:Youiti", "Bing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Bing", "Jiang Yu Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Jiang_Yu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
