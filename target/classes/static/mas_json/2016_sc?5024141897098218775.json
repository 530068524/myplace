{"title": "Increasing molecular dynamics simulation rates with an 8-fold increase in electrical power efficiency.", "fields": ["xeon", "instruction set", "electrical efficiency", "central processing unit", "cpu power dissipation"], "abstract": "Electrical power efficiency is a primary concern in designing modern HPC systems. Common strategies to improve CPU power efficiency rely on increased parallelism within a processor that is enabled both by an increase in the vector capabilities within the core and also the number of cores within a processor. Although many-core processors have been available for some time, achieving power-efficient performance has been challenging due to the offload model. Here, we evaluate performance of the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS on two new Intel\u00ae processors including the second generation many-core Intel\u00ae Xeon Phi\u2122 processor that is available as a bootable CPU. We describe our approach to measure power consumption out-of-band and software optimizations necessary to achieve energy efficiency. We analyze benefits from Intel\u00ae Advanced Vector Extensions 512 instructions and demonstrate increased simulations rates with over 9X the CPU+DRAM power efficiency when compared to the unoptimized code on previous generation processors.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["W.
