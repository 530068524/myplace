Specifically, we developed Jigsaw, a learning game that asks players to solve virtual jigsaw puzzles using tools in Adobe Photoshop. We conducted an eleven-person lab study of the prototype, and found the game to be an effective learning medium that can complement demonstration-based tutorials. Not only did the participants learn about new tools and techniques while actively solving the puzzles in Jigsaw, but they also recalled techniques that they had learned previously but had forgotten.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Tao Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Tao", "Mira Dontcheva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dontcheva:Mira", "Diana Joseph.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joseph:Diana", "Karrie Karahalios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karahalios:Karrie", "Mark W.
