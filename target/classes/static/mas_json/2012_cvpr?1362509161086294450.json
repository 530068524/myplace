The steady increase of processing power has enticed researchers to attempt increasingly challenging tasks on mobile devices with appropriate modifications over their stationary counterparts. In this work we present a novel multi-frame object detection application for the mobile platform that is capable of object localization. Our work leverages the hough forest based object detector introduced by Gall et al. in [10]. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our novel, multi-frame generalization of [10] notably improves the detection performance. We test the performance of the technique in variable resolutions, the applicability to several object categories and different datasets. We implement the multi-frame detector on a mobile platform through a novel client-server framework that presents a sound and viable environment for the multi-frame detector. Finally, we study implementations of both single and multi-frame object detectors based on this client-server framework on a mobile device running the android OS.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shyam Sunder Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Shyam_Sunder", "Min Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Min", "Silvio Savarese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savarese:Silvio"], "pages": 8}
