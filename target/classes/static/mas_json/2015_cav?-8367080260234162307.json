{"title": "The Hanoi Omega-Automata Format.", "fields": ["true quantified boolean formula", "omega", "formal verification", "common power format", "statistical model"], "abstract": "We propose a flexible exchange format for \\(\\omega \\)-automata, as typically used in formal verification, and implement support for it in a range of established tools. Our aim is to simplify the interaction of tools, helping the research community to build upon other people\u2019s work. A key feature of the format is the use of very generic acceptance conditions, specified by Boolean combinations of acceptance primitives, rather than being limited to common cases such as Buchi, Streett, or Rabin. Such flexibility in the choice of acceptance conditions can be exploited in applications, for example in probabilistic model checking, and furthermore encourages the development of acceptance-agnostic tools for automata manipulations. The format allows acceptance conditions that are either state-based or transition-based, and also supports alternating automata.\nOpen image in new window", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Masaryk University", "Masaryk University", "\u00c9cole Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avanc\u00e9es", "Dresden University of Technology", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s Babiak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babiak:Tom=aacute=s", "Frantisek Blahoudek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blahoudek:Frantisek", "Alexandre Duret-Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duret=Lutz:Alexandre", "Joachim Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein_0001:Joachim", "Jan Kret\u00ednsk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kret=iacute=nsk=yacute=:Jan", "David M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:David", "David Parker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parker_0001:David", "Jan Strejcek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strejcek:Jan"], "pages": 8}
