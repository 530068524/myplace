Our proposed approach is based on finding an optimal or a near-optimal {\\em compression tree} for a given sensor network: a compression tree is a directed tree over the sensor network nodes such that the value of a node is compressed using the value of its parent. We focus on {\\em broadcast communication} model in this paper, but our results are more generally applicable to a unicast communication model as well. We draw connections between the data collection problem and a previously studied graph concept called {\\em weakly connected dominating sets}, and we use this to develop novel approximation algorithms for the problem. We present comparative results on several synthetic and real-world datasets showing that our algorithms construct near-optimal compression trees that yield a significant reduction in the data collection cost.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Jian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0015:Jian", "Amol Deshpande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deshpande:Amol", "Samir Khuller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khuller:Samir"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
