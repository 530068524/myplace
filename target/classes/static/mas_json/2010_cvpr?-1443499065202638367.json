After the generation of these LMSs computed on one individual by tracking Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) [2] descriptor, we learn a codebook of video-words (i.e. clusters of LMSs) using k-means algorithm on a learning gesture video database. Then the video-words are compacted to a codebook of code-words by the Maximization of Mutual Information (MMI) algorithm. At the final step, we compare the LMSs generated for a new gesture w.r.t. the learned codebook via the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and a novel voting strategy. Our main contribution is the handling of the N to N mapping between code-words and gesture labels with the proposed voting strategy. Experiments have been carried out on two public gesture databases: KTH [16] and IXMAS [19]. Results show that the proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mohamed B\u00e9cha Ka\u00e2niche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ka=acirc=niche:Mohamed_B=eacute=cha", "Fran\u00e7ois Br\u00e9mond.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Br=eacute=mond:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 8}
