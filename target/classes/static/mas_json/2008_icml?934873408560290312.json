Some of these kernels are related to classic information theoretic quantities, such as mutual information and the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Meanwhile, driven by recent advances in Tsallis statistics, nonextensive generalizations of Shannon's information theory have been proposed. This paper bridges these two trends. We introduce the  Jensen-Tsallis q-difference , a generalization of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. We then define a new family of nonextensive mutual information kernels, which allow weights to be assigned to their arguments, and which includes the Boolean, Jensen-Shannon, and linear kernels as particular cases. We illustrate the performance of these kernels on text categorization tasks.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 F.
