In this paper, we introduce a virtual coordinate assignment protocol (ABVCap_Uni) to assign virtual coordinates to nodes that have no geographic information in wireless sensor networks with unidirectional links, and we propose a routing protocol based on the ABVCap_Uni virtual coordinates. Our routing protocol guarantees packet delivery without computation and storage of global topology features in a discrete domain. Using simulation, we evaluate the performance of the proposed routing protocol (ABVCap_Uni routing), the greedy landmark- descent routing protocol (GLDR+VLM routing), and the greedy routing protocol based on physical coordinates (Euclidean routing). The simulations demonstrate that our routing protocol ensures moderate routing path length cost overhead.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University"], "authors": ["Chia-Hung Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chia=Hung", "Bing-Hong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Bing=Hong", "Hong-Yen Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Hong=Yen", "Chi-Yen Kao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kao:Chi=Yen", "Ming-Jer Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Ming=Jer"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 5}
