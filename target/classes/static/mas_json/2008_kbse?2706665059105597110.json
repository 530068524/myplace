No effective interoperability is possible to date. DUALLY is an automated framework that aims to offer an answer to this need allowing architectural languages and tools interoperability. DUALLY has been implemented as an Eclipse plugin and it is based on model transformation techniques. This demonstration paper shows DUALLY by applying its approach to two outstanding architectural description languages.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Dipt. di Inf.,  ... quila, L'Aquila", "Dipt. di Inf.,  ... quila, L'Aquila", "Dipt. di Inf.,  ... quila, L'Aquila"], "authors": ["Ivano Malavolta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malavolta:Ivano", "Henry Muccini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muccini:Henry", "Patrizio Pelliccione.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pelliccione:Patrizio"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
