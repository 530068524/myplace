In this setting, we obtain new trade-offs between time and space for I/O efficient LTL model checking. First, we design a  c -bit semi-external algorithm for depth-first search. To achieve a low internal memory consumption, we construct a RAM-efficient perfect hash function from the vertex set stored on disk. We give a similar algorithm for double depth-first search, which checks for presence of accepting cycles and thus solves the LTL model checking problem. The I/O complexity of the search itself is proportional to the time for scanning the search space. For on-the-fly model checking we apply iterative-deepening strategy known from bounded model checking.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Masaryk University", "Faculty of Info ... ology, Germany"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Stefan Edelkamp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edelkamp:Stefan", "Peter Sanders.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanders_0001:Peter", "Pavel Simecek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simecek:Pavel"], "pages": 13}
