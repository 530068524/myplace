{"title": "Cooperative Games With Bounded Dependency Degree.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "bounded function", "shapley value", "computational problem", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "Cooperative games provide a framework to study cooperation among self-interested agents. They offer a number of solution concepts describing how the outcome of the cooperation should be shared among the players. Unfortunately, computational problems associated with many of these solution concepts tend to be intractable---NP-hard or worse. In this paper, we incorporate complexity measures recently proposed by Feige and Izsak (2013), called dependency degree and supermodular degree, into the complexity analysis of cooperative games. We show that many computational problems for cooperative games become tractable for games whose dependency degree or supermodular degree are bounded. In particular, we prove that simple games admit efficient algorithms for various solution concepts when the supermodular degree is small; further, we show that computing the Shapley value is always in FPT with respect to the dependency degree. Finally, we note that, while determining the dependency among players is computationally hard, there are efficient algorithms for special classes of games.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Ayumi Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Ayumi", "Rani Izsak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Izsak:Rani", "Edith Elkind.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkind:Edith"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
