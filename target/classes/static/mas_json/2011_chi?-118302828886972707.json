In our research, we investigate new interaction techniques that aim to make it easier to interact with these systems while driving. We suggest utilizing the steering wheel as an additional interaction surface. In this paper, we present two user studies conducted with a working prototype of a multi-touch steering wheel. In the first, we developed a user-defined steering wheel gesture set, and in the second, we applied the identified gestures and compared their application to conventional user interaction with infotainment systems in terms of driver distraction. The main outcome was that driver's visual demand is reduced significantly by using gestural interaction on the multi-touch steering wheel.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Duisburg-Essen", "University of Duisburg-Essen", "University of Warwick", "University of Duisburg-Essen", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tanja D\u00f6ring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=ouml=ring:Tanja", "Dagmar Kern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kern:Dagmar", "Paul Marshall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marshall:Paul", "Max Pfeiffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfeiffer:Max", "Johannes Sch\u00f6ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=ning:Johannes", "Volker Gruhn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gruhn:Volker", "Albrecht Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt_0001:Albrecht"], "pages": 10}
