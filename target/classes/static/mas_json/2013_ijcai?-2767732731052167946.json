{"title": "Forward Perimeter Search with Controlled Use of Memory.", "fields": ["incremental heuristic search", "beam search", "out of memory", "fringe search", "bidirectional search"], "abstract": "There are many hard shortest-path search problems that cannot be solved, because best-first search runs out of memory space and depth-first search runs out of time. We propose Forward Perimeter Search (FPS), a heuristic search with controlled use of memory. It builds a perimeter around the root node and tests each perimeter node for a shortest path to the goal. The perimeter is adaptively extended towards the goal during the search process.\n\nWe show that FPS expands in random 24-puzzles 50% fewer nodes than BF-IDA* while requiring several orders of magnitude less memory. Additionally, we present a hard problem instance of the 24-puzzle that needs at least 140 moves to solve; i.e. 26 more moves than the previously published hardest instance.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Zuse Institute Berlin", "Zuse Institute Berlin", "Zuse Institute Berlin"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Thorsten Sch\u00fctt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=uuml=tt:Thorsten", "Robert D\u00f6bbelin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=ouml=bbelin:Robert", "Alexander Reinefeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reinefeld:Alexander"], "pages": 7}
