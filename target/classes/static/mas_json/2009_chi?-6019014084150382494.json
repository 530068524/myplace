{"title": "Comparison of three one-question, post-task usability questionnaires.", "fields": ["likert scale", "software", "external validity", "sample size determination", "usability"], "abstract": "Post-task ratings of difficulty in a usability test have the potential to provide diagnostic information and be an additional measure of user satisfaction. But the ratings need to be reliable as well as easy to use for both respondents and researchers. Three one-question rating types were compared in a study with 26 participants who attempted the same five tasks with two software applications. The types were a Likert scale, a Usability Magnitude Estimation (UME) judgment, and a Subjective Mental Effort Question (SMEQ). All three types could distinguish between the applications with 26 participants, but the Likert and SMEQ types were more sensitive with small sample sizes. Both the Likert and SMEQ types were easy to learn and quick to execute. The online version of the SMEQ question was highly correlated with other measures and had equal sensitivity to the Likert question type.", "citation": "Citations (195)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation", "User Experience ... h Port, MA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jeff Sauro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sauro:Jeff", "Joseph S.
