{"title": "On the Interaction between Norm and Dimensionality: Multiple Regimes in Learning.", "fields": ["generalization error", "norm", "learning curve", "parametric statistics", "curse of dimensionality"], "abstract": "A learning problem might have several measures of complexity (e.g., norm and dimensionality) that affect the generalization error. What is the interaction between these complexities? Dimension-free learning theory bounds and parametric asymptotic analyses each provide a partial picture of the full learning curve. In this paper, we use high-dimensional asymptotics on two classical problems\u2014mean estimation and linear regression\u2014to explore the learning curve more completely. We show that these curves exhibit multiple regimes, where in each regime, the excess risk is controlled by a subset of the problem complexities.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "authors": ["Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy", "Nati Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nati"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
