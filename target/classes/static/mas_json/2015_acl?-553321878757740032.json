{"title": "Graph parsing with s-graph grammars.", "fields": ["s attributed grammar", "parsing expression grammar", "bottom up parsing", "top down parsing language", "indexed grammar"], "abstract": "A key problem in semantic parsing with graph-based semantic representations is graph parsing, i.e. computing all possible analyses of a given graph according to a grammar. This problem arises in training synchronous string-to-graph grammars, and when generating strings from them. We present two algorithms for graph parsing (bottom-up and top-down) with s-graph grammars. On the related problem of graph parsing with hyperedge replacement grammars, our implementations outperform the best previous system by several orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jonas Groschwitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Groschwitz:Jonas", "Alexander Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Alexander", "Christoph Teichmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teichmann:Christoph"], "pages": 10}
