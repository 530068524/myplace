Engineering effective features that can capture syntactic and semantic relations between the constituents composing the target text pairs is rather complex. Thus, we define syntactic and semantic structures representing the text pairs and then apply graph and tree kernels to them for automatically engineering features in Support Vector Machines. We carry out an extensive comparative analysis of stateof-the-art models for this type of relational learning. Our findings allow for achieving the highest accuracy in two different and important related tasks, i.e., Paraphrasing Identification and Textual Entailment Recognition.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Khalifa University", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Simone Filice.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filice:Simone", "Giovanni Da San Martino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martino:Giovanni_Da_San", "Alessandro Moschitti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moschitti:Alessandro"], "pages": 11}
