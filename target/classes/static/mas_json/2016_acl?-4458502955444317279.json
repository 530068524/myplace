{"title": "Improving Hypernymy Detection with an Integrated Path-based and Distributional Method.", "fields": ["computer science", "pattern recognition", "recurrent neural network", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Detecting hypernymy relations is a key task in NLP, which is addressed in the literature using two complementary approaches. Distributional methods, whose supervised variants are the current best performers, and path-based methods, which received less research attention. We suggest an improved path-based algorithm, in which the dependency paths are encoded using a recurrent neural network, that achieves results comparable to distributional methods. We then extend the approach to integrate both pathbased and distributional signals, significantly improving upon the state-of-the-art on this task.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Vered Shwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shwartz:Vered", "Yoav Goldberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldberg:Yoav", "Ido Dagan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dagan:Ido"], "pages": -1}
