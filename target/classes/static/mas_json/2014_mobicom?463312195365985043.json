{"title": "Demo: PhoneLets: offloading the phone off your phone for energy, cost and network load optimization.", "fields": ["mobile phone tracking", "radio access network", "gsm services", "mobile phone signal", "mobile identification number"], "abstract": "This demo presents how phone functionality can be offloaded from a smartphone over wireless link to a  PhoneLet  by sharing one SIM card across multiple devices. This can lead to significant cost and network load reductions by decreasing the number of simultaneously connected mobile clients. Furthermore, it can save energy for the mobile user when connected to a powered  PhoneLet  by offloading phone functionality. It absorbs the energy cost of online presence and inefficient mobile applications' communication patterns, instead providing connectivity for the user over a WiFi link.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Andrius Aucinas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aucinas:Andrius", "Jon Crowcroft.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crowcroft:Jon"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
