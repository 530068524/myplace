In the standard communication model, if one-way functions exist, then protocols satisfying any reasonable degree of privacy cannot be collusion-free. To circumvent this impossibility, Alwen, shelat and Visconti (CRYPTO 2008) recently suggested the mediated model where all communication passes through a mediator. The goal is to design protocols where collusion-freeness is guaranteed as long as the mediator is honest, while standard security guarantees hold if the mediator is dishonest. In this model, they gave constructions of collusion-free protocols for commitments and zero-knowledge proofs in the two-party setting.\n\nWe strengthen the definition of Alwen et al., and resolve the main open questions in this area by showing a collusion-free protocol (in the mediated model) for computing any multi-party functionality.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["New York University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Bar-Ilan University", "University of Salerno", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Jo\u00ebl Alwen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alwen:Jo=euml=l", "Jonathan Katz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katz:Jonathan", "Yehuda Lindell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindell:Yehuda", "Giuseppe Persiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Persiano:Giuseppe", "Abhi Shelat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shelat:Abhi", "Ivan Visconti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Visconti:Ivan"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2009", "pages": 17}
