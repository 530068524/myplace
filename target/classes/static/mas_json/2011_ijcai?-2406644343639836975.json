{"title": "A Flat Histogram Method for Computing the Density of States of Combinatorial Problems.", "fields": ["true quantified boolean formula", "maximum satisfiability problem", "markov chain monte carlo", "counting problem", "sat"], "abstract": "Consider a combinatorial state space S, such as the set of all truth assignments to N Boolean variables. Given a partition of S, we consider the problem of estimating the size of all the subsets in which S is divided. This problem, also known as computing the density of states, is quite general and has many applications. For instance, if we consider a Boolean formula in CNF and we partition according to the number of violated constraints, computing the density of states is a generalization of both SAT, MAXSAT and model counting.\n\nWe propose a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to compute the density of states of Boolean formulas that is based on a flat histogram approach. Our method represents a new approach to a variety of inference, learning, and counting problems. We demonstrate its practical effectiveness by showing that the method converges quickly to an accurate solution on a range of synthetic and real-world instances.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Stefano Ermon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ermon:Stefano", "Carla P.
