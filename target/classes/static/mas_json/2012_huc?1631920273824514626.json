{"title": "Detecting pedestrian flocks by fusion of multi-modal sensors in mobile phones.", "fields": ["novelty", "flock", "hierarchical clustering", "accelerometer", "pedestrian"], "abstract": "Previous work on the recognition of human movement patterns has mainly focused on movements of individuals. This paper addresses the joint identification of the indoor movement of  multiple  persons forming a cohesive whole - specifically a flock - with clustering approaches operating on features derived from multiple sensor modalities of modern smartphones. Automatic detection of flocks has several important applications, including evacuation management and socially aware computing. The novelty of this paper is, firstly, to use data fusion techniques to combine several sensor modalities (WiFi, accelerometer and compass) to improve recognition accuracy over previous unimodal approaches. Secondly, improve the recognition of flocks using hierarchical clustering. We use a dataset comprising 16 subjects forming one to four flocks walking in a building on single and multiple floors. With the best settings, we achieve a F-score accuracy of up to 87 percent an improvement of up to twelve percent points over existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Mikkel Baun Kj\u00e6rgaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kj=aelig=rgaard:Mikkel_Baun", "Martin Wirz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wirz:Martin", "Daniel Roggen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roggen:Daniel", "Gerhard Tr\u00f6ster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tr=ouml=ster:Gerhard"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
