{"title": "Using optical defocus to denoise.", "fields": ["optical imaging", "computer vision", "deconvolution", "coupling", "noise reduction"], "abstract": "Effective reduction of noise is generally difficult because of the possible tight coupling of noise with high-frequency image structure. The problem is worse under low-light conditions. In this paper, we propose slightly optically defocusing the image in order to loosen this noise-image structure coupling. This allows us to more effectively reduce noise and subsequently restore the small defocus. We analytically show how this is possible, and demonstrate our technique on a number of examples that include low-light images.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Washington", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Microsoft", "University of Washington"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Qi Shan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shan:Qi", "Jiaya Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jiaya", "Sing Bing Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Sing_Bing", "Zenglu Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Zenglu"], "pages": 8}
