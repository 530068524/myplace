Surface Games open up interesting new possibilities for exploring tangible interaction with respect to play. In particular, Surface Games create exciting opportunities for challenging traditional paradigms of board games such as: pre-defined boards, pre-defined playing pieces, turn-based action, and the responsibility of players for game management and rule-checking. The goal of Surface Games is to explore new interaction paradigms that bridge physical and digital gaming environments in the context of computational surfaces.   This paper describes four key paradigms for computationally extending board games: surface as referee and fluid interaction, relative environments, physicality and game balance, and tangible playware and surfaces. We explore these paradigms through a prototype game - PINS - that has been designed specifically for a multitouch-tangible surface.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of A ... , Linz, Austria", "University of A ... , Linz, Austria", "University of A ... , Linz, Austria", "University of A ... , Linz, Austria"], "authors": ["Travis Kirton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirton:Travis", "Hideaki Ogawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogawa:Hideaki", "Christa Sommerer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sommerer:Christa", "Laurent Mignonneau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mignonneau:Laurent"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
