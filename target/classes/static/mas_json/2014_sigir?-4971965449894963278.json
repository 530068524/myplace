However, it is not an easy job to find appropriate citations for a given context, especially for citations in different languages. In this paper, we define a novel task of cross-language context-aware citation recommendation, which aims at recommending English citations for a given context of the place where a citation is made in a Chinese paper. This task is very challenging because the contexts and citations are written in different languages and there exists a language gap when matching them. To tackle this problem, we propose the bilingual context-citation embedding algorithm (i.e. BLSRec-I), which can learn a low-dimensional joint embedding space for both contexts and citations. Moreover, two advanced algorithms named BLSRec-II and BLSRec-III are proposed by enhancing BLSRec-I with translation results and abstract information, respectively. We evaluate the proposed methods based on a real dataset that contains Chinese contexts and English citations. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can outperform a few baselines and the BLSRec-II and BLSRec-III methods can outperform the BLSRec-I method.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Xuewei Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xuewei", "Xiaojun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan_0001:Xiaojun", "Xun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xun"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
