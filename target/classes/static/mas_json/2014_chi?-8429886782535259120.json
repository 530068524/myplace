{"title": "Pay or delay: the role of technology when managing a low income.", "fields": ["public relations", "qualitative research", "grounded theory", "management", "financial inclusion"], "abstract": "This paper reports on a qualitative study of 38 low-income individuals living in the North East of England. The participants' experiences of money, banking and the role digital technology plays in their financial practices were identified through semi-structured interviews in people's homes and group workshops. A grounded theory analysis of these data characterises how technology both helped and hindered participants to keep close control of their finances. These findings suggest design opportunities for future digital banking technologies that extend the already sophisticated practices of individuals managing a low income, focusing on: delaying, prioritising, planning, watching, and hiding monetary transactions.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "University of York"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["John Vines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vines:John", "Paul Dunphy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunphy:Paul", "Andrew Monk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monk:Andrew"], "pages": 10}
