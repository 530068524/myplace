The interface is reachable from outside and inside of the pocket to allow for a combined dual-sided touch input. The user can control an absolute cursor with their thumb sliding along the fabric from the inside, while at the same time tapping or swiping with fingers from the outside to perform joint gestures. This allows for resting the hand in a comfortable and quickly accessible position, while performing interaction with a high expressiveness that is feasible in mobile scenarios.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "University of Ulm"], "authors": ["David Dobbelstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobbelstein:David", "Gabriel Haas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haas:Gabriel", "Christian Winkler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winkler:Christian", "Enrico Rukzio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rukzio:Enrico"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
