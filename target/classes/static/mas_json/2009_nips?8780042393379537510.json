The model is trained using execution traces of passing test runs; it reflects the distribution over transitional patterns of code positions. Given a failing test case, the model determines the least likely transitional pattern in the execution trace. The model is designed such that Bayesian inference has a closed-form solution. We evaluate the Bernoulli graph model on data of the software projects AspectJ and Rhino.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "University of Potsdam"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Laura Dietz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dietz:Laura", "Valentin Dallmeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dallmeier:Valentin", "Andreas Zeller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeller:Andreas", "Tobias Scheffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scheffer:Tobias"], "pages": 9}
