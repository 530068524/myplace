In this paper, we study the complexity of percentile queries in such MDPs and give algorithms to synthesize strategies that enforce such constraints. Given a multi-dimensional weighted MDP and a quantitative payoff function f, thresholds \\(v_i\\) (one per dimension), and probability thresholds \\(\\alpha _i\\), we show how to compute a single strategy to enforce that for all dimensions i, the probability of outcomes \\(\\rho \\) satisfying \\(f_i(\\rho ) \\ge v_i\\) is at least \\(\\alpha _i\\). We consider classical quantitative payoffs from the literature (sup, inf, lim sup, lim inf, mean-payoff, truncated sum, discounted sum). Our work extends to the quantitative case the multi-objective model checking problem studied by Etessami et al.
