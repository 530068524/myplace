The critical nature of these applications necessitates a high level of software design quality. A survey of software architects indicated a low level of satisfaction with existing design assessment practices in CT DC AA and highlighted several shortcomings of existing practices. To address this, we have developed a design assessment method called MIDAS (Method for Intensive Design ASsessments). MIDAS is an expert-based method wherein manual assessment of design quality by experts is directed by the systematic application of design analysis tools through the use of a three view-model consisting of design principles, project-specific constraints, and an \u201cility\u201d-based quality model. In this paper, we describe the motivation for MIDAS, its design, and its application to three projects in CT DC AA. We believe that the insights from our MIDAS experience not only provide useful pointers to other organizations and practitioners looking to assess and improve software design quality but also suggest research questions for the software engineering community to explore.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Siemens", "Siemens", "Siemens", "Siemens"], "authors": ["Ganesh Samarthyam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samarthyam:Ganesh", "Girish Suryanarayana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suryanarayana:Girish", "Tushar Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Tushar", "Shrinath Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Shrinath"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
