The representation is fully expressive, in that it can capture all games defined over a finite set of alternatives. Moreover, due to the knowledge representation capabilities of answer set programs, it can easily accommodate the definition of games within a wide range of application domains, ranging from scheduling, to routing and planning, just to name a few. The computational complexity of the proposed framework is studied, in particular, by focusing on the core as the prototypical solution concept. A system supporting the basic reasoning tasks arising therein is also made available, and results of experimental activity are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Calabria", "University of Calabria", "University of Calabria", "University of Calabria"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Giovanni Amendola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amendola:Giovanni", "Gianluigi Greco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greco:Gianluigi", "Nicola Leone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leone:Nicola", "Pierfrancesco Veltri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veltri:Pierfrancesco"], "pages": 8}
