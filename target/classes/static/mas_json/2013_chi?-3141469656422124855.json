{"title": "A text message a day keeps the pulmonologist away.", "fields": ["randomized controlled trial", "health belief model", "health intervention", "asthma", "chronic care"], "abstract": "The goal of this study was to extend and replicate an SMS health intervention for pediatric asthma patients. This intervention was designed using the Health Belief Model (HBM). Thirty patients were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. In the Knowledge condition patients were queried about their asthma knowledge every other day. In the Knowledge and Symptoms condition patients received a daily text message. They were queried about their symptoms and knowledge of asthma on alternate days. The Control group received no texts. Our main finding is that daily text messages lead to improved health outcomes.   We explain our results in the context of interview data and the HBM. We conclude by suggesting that the HBM can be used to inform and evaluate system design for chronic care beyond asthma and by considering the role that replication studies can play in HCI research.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Samsung", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Tae-Jung Yun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yun:Tae=Jung", "Rosa I.
