To encourage users to adopt delay-tolerant scheduling for capacityimprovement, it is critical to provide guarantees in terms of completion time. In this paper, we study application-level scheduling with deadline constraints, where the deadline is pre-specified by users/applications and is associated with a deadline violation probability. To address the exponentially-high complexity due to temporally-varying channel conditions and deadline constraints, we develop a novel asymptotic approach that exploits the largeness of the network to our advantage. Specifically, we identify a lower bound on the deadline violation probability, and propose simple policies that achieve the lower bound in the large-system regime. The results in this paper thus provide a rigorous analytical framework to develop and analyze policies for applicationlevel scheduling under very general settings of channel models and deadline requirements. Further, based on the asymptotic approach, we propose the notion of Application-Level Effective Capacity region, i.e., the throughput region that can be supported subject to deadline constraints, which allows us to quantify the potential gain of application-level scheduling.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Purdue University", "Microsoft", "Beihang University"], "authors": ["Huasen Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Huasen", "Xiaojun Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xiaojun", "Xin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Xin", "Youguang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Youguang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
