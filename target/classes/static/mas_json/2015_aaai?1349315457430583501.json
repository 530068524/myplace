{"title": "Localized Centering: Reducing Hubness in Large-Sample Data.", "fields": ["computer science", "phenomenon", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Hubness has been recently identified as a problematic phenomenon occurring in high-dimensional space. In this paper, we address a different type of hubness that occurs when the number of samples is large. We investigate the difference between the hubness in high-dimensional data and the one in large-sample data. One finding is that centering, which is known to reduce the former, does not work for the latter. We then propose a new hub-reduction method, called localized centering. It is an extension of centering, yet works effectively for both types of hubness. Using real-world datasets consisting of a large number of documents, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves the accuracy of \u03ba-nearest neighbor classification.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["National Institute of Genetics", "National Institute of Genetics", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "The Institute o ... , Tokyo, Japan", "The Institute o ... , Tokyo, Japan"], "authors": ["Kazuo Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hara:Kazuo", "Ikumi Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Ikumi", "Masashi Shimbo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimbo:Masashi", "Kei Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Kei", "Kenji Fukumizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukumizu:Kenji", "Milos Radovanovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radovanovic:Milos"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
