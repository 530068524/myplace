{"title": "Wearing a YouTube hat: directors, comedians, gurus, and user aggregated behavior.", "fields": ["multimedia", "user profile", "internet privacy", "social network", "social engagement"], "abstract": "While existing studies on YouTube's massive user-generated video content have mostly focused on the analysis of videos, their characteristics, and network properties, little attention has been paid to the analysis of users' long-term behavior as it relates to the roles they self-define and (explicitly or not) play in the site. In this paper, we present a novel statistical analysis of aggregated user behavior in YouTube from the novel perspective of user categories, a feature that allows people to ascribe to popular roles and to potentially reach certain communities. Using a sample of 270,000 users, we found that a high level of interaction and participation is concentrated on a relatively small, yet significant, group of users, following recognizable patterns of personal and social involvement. Based on our analysis, we also show that by using simple behavioral features from user profiles, people can be automatically classified according to their category with accuracy rates of up to 73%.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Idiap Research Institute", "Idiap Research Institute"], "authors": ["Joan-Isaac Biel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biel:Joan=Isaac", "Daniel Gatica-Perez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gatica=Perez:Daniel"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
