{"title": "ZMap: Fast Internet-wide Scanning and Its Security Applications.", "fields": ["ipv4 address exhaustion", "user space", "modular design", "scanner", "gigabit ethernet"], "abstract": "Internet-wide network scanning has numerous security applications, including exposing new vulnerabilities and tracking the adoption of defensive mechanisms, but probing the entire public address space with existing tools is both difficult and slow. We introduce ZMap, a modular, open-source network scanner specifically architected to perform Internet-wide scans and capable of surveying the entire IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes from user space on a single machine, approaching the theoretical maximum speed of gigabit Ethernet. We present the scanner architecture, experimentally characterize its performance and accuracy, and explore the security implications of high speed Internet-scale network surveys, both offensive and defensive. We also discuss best practices for good Internet citizenship when performing Internet-wide surveys, informed by our own experiences conducting a long-term research survey over the past year.", "citation": "Citations (387)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Zakir Durumeric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durumeric:Zakir", "Eric Wustrow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wustrow:Eric", "J.
