The programming language ecosystem has diversified over the last fewdecades, and non-trivial programs are likely to be written in more than asingle language. Unfortunately, language interfaces such as Java NativeInterface and Python/C are difficult to use correctly and the scope offault localization goes beyond language boundaries, which makes debugging multilingualbugs challenging. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we propose amutation-based fault localization technique for real-world multilingualprograms. To improve the accuracy of locating multilingual bugs, we havedeveloped and applied new mutation operators as well as conventional mutationoperators. The results of the empirical evaluation for six non-trivial real-worldmultilingual bugs are promising in that the proposed technique identifies the buggystatements as the most suspicious statements for all six bugs.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "GIST, Gwangju, South Korea", "GIST, Gwangju, South Korea"], "authors": ["Shin Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Shin", "Byeongcheol Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Byeongcheol", "Taehoon Kwak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwak:Taehoon", "Yiru Jeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeon:Yiru", "Bongsuk Ko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ko:Bongsuk", "Yunho Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Yunho", "Moonzoo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Moonzoo"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
