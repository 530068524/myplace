{"title": "Investigating contextual cues as indicators for EMA delivery.", "fields": ["conversation", "computer science", "data mining"], "abstract": "In this work, we attempt to determine whether the contextual information of a participant can be used to predict whether the participant will respond to a particular Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) trigger. We use a publicly available dataset for our work, and find that by using basic contextual features about the participant's activity, conversation status, audio, and location, we can predict if an EMA triggered at a particular time will be answered with a precision of 0.647, which is significantly higher than a baseline precision of 0.41. Using this knowledge, the researchers conducting field studies can efficiently schedule EMAs and achieve higher response rates.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Dartmouth College", "Clemson University", "Dartmouth College", "Clemson University", "Dartmouth College"], "authors": ["Varun Mishra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mishra:Varun", "Byron Lowens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lowens:Byron", "Sarah Lord.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lord:Sarah", "Kelly Caine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caine:Kelly", "David Kotz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotz:David"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
