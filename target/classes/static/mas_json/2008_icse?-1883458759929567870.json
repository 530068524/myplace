To enable validation in these situations, we present a new technique that puts valid inputs into a consistent format and that identifies \"questionable\" inputs which might be valid or invalid, so that these values can be double-checked by a person or a program. Our technique relies on the concept of a \"tope\", which is an application-independent abstraction describing how to recognize and transform values in a category of data. We present our definition of topes and describe a development environment that supports the implementation and use of topes. Experiments with web application and spreadsheet data indicate that using our technique improves the accuracy and reusability of validation code and also improves the effectiveness of subsequent data cleaning such as duplicate identification.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Christopher Scaffidi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scaffidi:Christopher", "Brad A.
