{"title": "Generating Fine-Grained Reviews of Songs from Album Reviews.", "fields": ["recommender system", "multimedia", "computer science", "information extraction"], "abstract": "Music Recommendation Systems often recommend individual songs, as opposed to entire albums. The challenge is to generate reviews for each song, since only full album reviews are available on-line. We developed a summarizer that combines information extraction and generation techniques to produce summaries of reviews of individual songs. We present an intrinsic evaluation of the extraction components, and of the informativeness of the summaries; and a user study of the impact of the song review summaries on users' decision making processes. Users were able to make quicker and more informed decisions when presented with the summary as compared to the full album review.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Swati Tata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tata:Swati", "Barbara Di Eugenio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eugenio:Barbara_Di"], "pages": 10}
