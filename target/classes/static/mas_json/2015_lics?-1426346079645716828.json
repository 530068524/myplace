{"title": "Reachability in Two-Dimensional Vector Addition Systems with States Is PSPACE-Complete.", "fields": ["bounded function", "pspace complete", "unary operation", "integer", "reachability"], "abstract": "Known to be decidable since 1981, there still remains a huge gap between the best known lower and upper bounds for the reach ability problem for vector addition systems with states (VASS). Here the problem is shown PSPACE-complete in the two-dimensional case, vastly improving on the doubly exponential time bound established in 1986 by Howell, Rosier, Huynh and Yen. Cover ability and bounded ness for two-dimensional VASS are also shown PSPACE-complete, and reach ability in two-dimensional VASS and in integer VASS under unary encoding are considered.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["DIRO, Univ. de  ... eal, QC, Canada", "Lab.
