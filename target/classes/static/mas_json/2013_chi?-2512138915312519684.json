{"title": "High-precision pointing on large wall displays using small handheld devices.", "fields": ["computer vision", "mobile device", "artificial intelligence", "computer science"], "abstract": "Rich interaction with high-resolution wall displays is not limited to remotely pointing at targets. Other relevant types of interaction include virtual navigation, text entry, and direct manipulation of control widgets. However, most techniques for remotely acquiring targets with high precision have studied remote pointing in isolation, focusing on pointing efficiency and ignoring the need to support these other types of interaction. We investigate high-precision pointing techniques capable of acquiring targets as small as 4 millimeters on a 5.5 meters wide display while leaving up to 93 % of a typical tablet device's screen space available for task-specific widgets. We compare these techniques to state-of-the-art distant pointing techniques and show that two of our techniques, a purely relative one and one that uses head orientation, perform as well or better than the best pointing-only input techniques while using a fraction of the interaction resources.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Alberta", "University of Manitoba"], "authors": ["Mathieu Nancel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nancel:Mathieu", "Olivier Chapuis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chapuis:Olivier", "Emmanuel Pietriga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietriga:Emmanuel", "Xing-Dong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xing=Dong", "Pourang P.
