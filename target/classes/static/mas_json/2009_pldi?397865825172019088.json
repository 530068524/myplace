Although approaches to designing typed program representations for sublanguages of some base language have become quite popular recently, the question whether a fully metacircular typed self-representation is possible is still open. This paper makes a big step towards this aim by defining the F \u03c9 * calculus, an extension of the higher-order polymorphic lambda calculus F \u03c9  that allows typed self-representations. While the usability of these representations for metaprogramming is still limited, we believe that our approach makes a significant step towards a new generation of reflective languages that are both safe and efficient.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University"], "authors": ["Tillmann Rendel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rendel:Tillmann", "Klaus Ostermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostermann:Klaus", "Christian Hofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofer:Christian"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2009", "pages": 11}
