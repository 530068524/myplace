However, it is often a challenge especially when it comes to evaluating applications running on mobile devices because of the restrictions posed by the device and the lack of supporting tools and software available to collect the necessary usability data. This paper proposes a methodology and framework to aid developers in preparing the mobile system for usability analysis. The focus is on the simplification of the developer's task in preparing the system for evaluation and the processing of the collected usability data by automating some of the tasks involved in the process.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "authors": ["Florence T.
