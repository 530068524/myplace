Our efforts focus on the specific problem of cost-based join-order optimization for conjunctive relational queries, a critical component of production-quality query optimizers. We characterize the general query-planning problem as a delete-free planning problem, and query plan optimization as a context-sensitive cost-optimal planning problem. We propose algorithms that generate high-quality query plans, guaranteeing optimality under certain conditions. Our approach is general, supporting the use of a broad suite of domain-independent and domain-specific optimization criteria. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI planning techniques for query plan generation and optimization.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "University of Toronto", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Nathan Robinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robinson:Nathan", "Sheila A.
