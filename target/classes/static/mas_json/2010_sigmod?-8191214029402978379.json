{"title": "Midas: integrating public financial data.", "fields": ["data cleansing", "commission", "mashup", "deposit insurance", "information integration"], "abstract": "The primary goal of the Midas project is to build a system that enables easy and scalable integration of unstructured and semi-structured information present across multiple data sources. As a first step in this direction, we have built a system that extracts and integrates information from regulatory filings submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Midas creates a repository of entities, events, and relationships by extracting, conceptualizing, integrating, and aggregating data from unstructured and semi-structured documents. This repository enables applications to use the extracted and integrated data in a variety of ways including mashups with other public data and complex risk analysis.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sreeram Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Sreeram", "Vivian Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Vivian", "Mauricio A.
