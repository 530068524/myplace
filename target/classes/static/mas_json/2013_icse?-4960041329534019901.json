However, there exists a gap between well-tooled software development methodologies and HCI techniques, which are generally isolated from the development toolchain and require specific expertise. In this paper, we propose a human-driven software development methodology making User Interface (UI) a full-fledged dimension of software design. To make this methodology useful in practice, a UI design lan- guage and a user modeling language are integrated into a tool suite that guides the stakeholders during the development process, while ensuring the conformance between the UI design and its implementation.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Bordeaux", "University of Bordeaux", "University of Bordeaux", "University of Bordeaux"], "authors": ["Emilie Balland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balland:Emilie", "Charles Consel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Consel:Charles", "Bernard N'Kaoua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/N=Kaoua:Bernard", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sauz\u00e9on.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sauz=eacute=on:H=eacute=l=egrave=ne"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
