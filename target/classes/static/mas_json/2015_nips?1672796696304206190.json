As a result, the most accurate parsers are domain specific, complex, and inefficient. In this paper we show that the domain agnostic attention-enhanced sequence-to-sequence model achieves state-of-the-art results on the most widely used syntactic constituency parsing dataset, when trained on a large synthetic corpus that was annotated using existing parsers. It also matches the performance of standard parsers when trained only on a small human-annotated dataset, which shows that this model is highly data-efficient, in contrast to sequence-to-sequence models without the attention mechanism. Our parser is also fast, processing over a hundred sentences per second with an unoptimized CPU implementation.", "citation": "Citations (437)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Oriol Vinyals.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vinyals:Oriol", "Lukasz Kaiser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaiser:Lukasz", "Terry Koo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koo:Terry", "Slav Petrov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrov:Slav", "Ilya Sutskever.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sutskever:Ilya", "Geoffrey E.
