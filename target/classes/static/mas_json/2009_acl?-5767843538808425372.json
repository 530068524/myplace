{"title": "Improving Tree-to-Tree Translation with Packed Forests.", "fields": ["bleu", "phrase", "probabilistic logic", "grammar", "parsing"], "abstract": "Current tree-to-tree models suffer from parsing errors as they usually use only 1-best parses for rule extraction and decoding. We instead propose a forest-based tree-to-tree model that uses packed forests. The model is based on a probabilistic synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG), which can be learned from aligned forest pairs automatically. The decoder finds ways of decomposing trees in the source forest into elementary trees using the source projection of STSG while building target forest in parallel. Comparable to the state-of-the-art phrase-based system Moses, using packed forests in tree-to-tree translation results in a significant absolute improvement of 3.6 BLEU points over using 1-best trees.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Yang", "Yajuan L\u00fc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=uuml=:Yajuan", "Qun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qun"], "pages": 9}
