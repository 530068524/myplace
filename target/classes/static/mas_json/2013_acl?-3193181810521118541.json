In one embodiment, a method of and computer program product for text normalization are provided. An input sequence comprising a plurality of tokens is received. A plurality of generators is applied to the input sequence to generate a set of candidate replacements of the tokens of the sequence. A plurality of subsets of the set of candidate replacements is determined such that the candidate replacements of each subset are syntactically consistent. A probability is determined for each of the subsets. A subset of the plurality of subsets having the highest probability is selected. Each candidate replacement of the selected subset is applied to the input sequence to generate an output sequence. The output sequence is outputted.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Washington", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Congle Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Congle", "Tyler Baldwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baldwin:Tyler", "Howard Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Howard", "Benny Kimelfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimelfeld:Benny", "Yunyao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Yunyao"], "pages": 10}
