{"title": "Dynamically replicated memory: building reliable systems from nanoscale resistive memories.", "fields": ["dynamic random access memory", "memory hierarchy", "cpu cache", "memory controller", "page table"], "abstract": "DRAM is facing severe scalability challenges in sub-45nm tech- nology nodes due to precise charge placement and sensing hur- dles in deep-submicron geometries. Resistive memories, such as phase-change memory (PCM), already scale well beyond DRAM and are a promising DRAM replacement. Unfortunately, PCM is write-limited, and current approaches to managing writes must de- commission pages of PCM when the first bit fails.   This paper presents  dynamically replicated memory  (DRM), the first hardware and operating system interface designed for PCM that allows  continued operation through graceful degradation  when hard faults occur. DRM reuses memory pages that con- tain hard faults by dynamically forming pairs of complementary pages that act as a single page of storage. No changes are required to the processor cores, the cache hierarchy, or the operating sys- tem's page tables. By changing the memory controller, the TLBs, and the operating system to be DRM-aware, we can improve the lifetime of PCM by up to 40x over conventional error-detection techniques.", "citation": "Citations (161)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Engin Ipek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ipek:Engin", "Jeremy Condit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Condit:Jeremy", "Edmund B.
