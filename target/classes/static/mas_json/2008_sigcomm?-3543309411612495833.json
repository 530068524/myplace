AIP uses a hierarchy of self-certifying addresses, in which each component is derived from the public key of the corresponding entity. We discuss how AIP enables simple solutions to source spoofing, denial-of-service, route hijacking, and route forgery. We also discuss how AIP's design meets the challenges of scaling, key management, and traffic engineering.", "citation": "Citations (410)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["David G.
