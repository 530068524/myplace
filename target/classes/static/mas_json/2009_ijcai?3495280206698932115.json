ELEXIR represents the plans to be recognized with a grammatical formalism called Combinatory Categorial Grammar(CCG). We show that representing plans with CCGs can allow us to prevent early commitment to plan goals and thereby reduce runtime.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Christopher W.
