In this paper, we propose an approach of entity search by formalizing both context matching and category matching. In addition, we propose a result re-ranking strategy that can be easily adapted to achieve a hybrid of two context matching strategies. Experiments on the INEX 2009 entity ranking task show that the proposed approach achieves a significant improvement of the entity search performance (xinfAP from 0.27 to 0.39) over the existing solutions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Microsoft", "Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China"], "authors": ["Yueguo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yueguo", "Lexi Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Lexi", "Shuming Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Shuming", "Xiaoyong Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Xiaoyong", "Ji-Rong Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Ji=Rong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
