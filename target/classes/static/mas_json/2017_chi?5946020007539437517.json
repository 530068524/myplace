{"title": "Rice Today, Roti Tomorrow: Diets and Diabetes in Urban Indian Households.", "fields": ["qualitative research", "disease", "social network", "situated", "unit of analysis"], "abstract": "In India, where diabetes is a growing concern and approximately 69 million are affected, we investigate the factors that influence diet management, a critical component of living with the disease. Taking the middle-income diabetes-affected household as our unit of analysis, we use a combination of semi-structured interviews and a design probe to understand if and how diets are monitored, tailored, and balanced. We research the various information-seeking behaviors of our participants and their culturally situated approaches to food and eating. Our findings illuminate how contextual nuances shape individuals' beliefs around dealing with diabetes and the ways in which family, friends, and broader social networks influence dietary decisions. We conclude by offering a framework of  Learning-Being-Doing  to inform the holistic design of technologies for managing diets and diabetes.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Michigan", "Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad", "THRIVE, Atlanta, GA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jasmine Hentschel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hentschel:Jasmine", "Samyukta Manjayya Sherugar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sherugar:Samyukta_Manjayya", "Rui Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Rui", "Vaishnav Kameswaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kameswaran:Vaishnav", "Rajesh Chandwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandwani:Rajesh", "Neha Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Neha"], "pages": 13}
