{"title": "StalemateBreaker: A Proactive Content-Introducing Approach to Automatic Human-Computer Conversation.", "fields": ["stalemate", "machine learning", "natural language processing", "utterance", "conversation"], "abstract": "Existing open-domain human-computer conversation systems are typically passive: they either synthesize or retrieve a reply provided with a humanissued utterance. It is generally presumed that humans should take the role to lead the conversation and introduce new content when a stalemate occurs, and that computers only need to \"respond.\" In this paper, we propose STALEMATEBREAKER, a conversation system that can proactively introduce new content when appropriate. We design a pipeline to determine when, what, and how to introduce new content during human-computer conversation. We further propose a novel reranking algorithm Bi-PageRank-HITS to enable rich interaction between conversation context and candidate replies. Experiments show that both the content-introducing approach and the reranking algorithm are effective. Our full STALEMATEBREAKER model outperforms a state-of-the-practice conversation system by +14.4% [email\u00a0protected] when a stalemate occurs.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Peking University", "Chinese Ministry of Education", "Baidu", "Peking University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiang", "Lili Mou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mou:Lili", "Rui Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Rui", "Ming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Ming"], "pages": 7}
