Recent research shows that a key to success is to consider the overall shape of the posterior distribution p(x, k\\y) and not only its mode. This leads to a distinction between MAP x, k  strategies which estimate the mode pair x, k and often lead to undesired results, and MAP k  strategies which select the best k while marginalizing over all possible x images. The MAP k  principle is significantly more robust than the MAP x, k  one, yet, it involves a challenging marginalization over latent images. As a result, MAP k  techniques are considered complicated, and have not been widely exploited. This paper derives a simple approximated MAP k  algorithm which involves only a modest modification of common MAP x, k  algorithms. We show that MAP k  can, in fact, be optimized easily, with no additional computational complexity.", "citation": "Citations (421)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Anat Levin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levin:Anat", "Yair Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:Yair", "Fr\u00e9do Durand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durand:Fr=eacute=do", "William T.
