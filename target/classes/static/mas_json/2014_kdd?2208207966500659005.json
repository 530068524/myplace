It is a common industry practice to use a generalized second price auction mechanism to rank advertisements at every opportunity of an impression. This greedy algorithm is suboptimal for both advertisers and publishers when advertisers have a finite budget. In a greedy mechanism high performing advertisers tend to drop out of the auction marketplace fast and that adversely affects both the advertiser experience and the publisher revenue. We describe a method for improving such ad serving systems by including a budget pacing component that serves ads by being aware of global supply patterns. Such a system is beneficial for both advertisers and publishers. We demonstrate the benefits of this component using experiments we conducted on advertising at LinkedIn.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["LinkedIn", "LinkedIn", "LinkedIn", "LinkedIn"], "authors": ["Deepak Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Deepak", "Souvik Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Souvik", "Kai Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Kai", "Siyu You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Siyu"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
