The study reveals that, even without antenna directivity gain, the directionality of signals changes the MIMO channel structure and provides a way to improve MIMO throughput performance. It also shows that it is sufficient for the improvement to consider only a small subset out of all possible antenna direction combinations. Finally, our study shows that it is possible to achieve both throughput gains and interference reduction, thus increasing network spatial reuse.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Technicolor", "Technicolor"], "authors": ["Tae Hyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Tae_Hyun", "Theodoros Salonidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salonidis:Theodoros", "Henrik Lundgren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lundgren:Henrik"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
