However, obtaining a massive amount of well-labeled data is usually very expensive and time consuming. In this paper, we introduce a general framework to train CNNs with only a limited number of clean labels and millions of easily obtained noisy labels. We model the relationships between images, class labels and label noises with a probabilistic graphical model and further integrate it into an end-to-end deep learning system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect a large-scale real-world clothing classification dataset with both noisy and clean labels. Experiments on this dataset indicate that our approach can better correct the noisy labels and improves the performance of trained CNNs.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Baidu", "Baidu", "Baidu", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tong Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Tong", "Tian Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Tian", "Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yi", "Chang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chang", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang"], "pages": 9}
