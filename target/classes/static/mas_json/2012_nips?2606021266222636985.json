Given a set of multiple hypotheses, such components/users typically have the ability to retrieve the best (or approximately the best) solution in this set. The standard approach for handling such a scenario is to first learn a single-output model and then produce M-Best Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) hypotheses from this model. In contrast, we learn to produce multiple outputs by formulating this task as a multiple-output structured-output prediction problem with a loss-function that effectively captures the setup of the problem. We present a max-margin formulation that minimizes an upper-bound on this loss-function. Experimental results on image segmentation and protein side-chain prediction show that our method outperforms conventional approaches used for this type of scenario and leads to substantial improvements in prediction accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Virginia Tech", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Abner Guzm\u00e1n-Rivera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guzm=aacute=n=Rivera:Abner", "Dhruv Batra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Batra:Dhruv", "Pushmeet Kohli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohli:Pushmeet"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
