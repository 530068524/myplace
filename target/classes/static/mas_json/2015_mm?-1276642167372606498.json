Compared to traditional linear videos, they have advantages especially in e-learning and training, where the study matter can be fitted to the needs of the viewer. In this paper we present the SIVA Suite, an open source framework for the creation, playback, and administration of hypervideos. The SIVA Suite consists of an authoring tool, an HTML5 hypervideo player, and a Web server for user and video management. This framework has been successfully used for the creation of hypervideos in different use cases, e.g. a medical hypervideo training. It was evaluated in several usability tests and improved step-by-step since 2008.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau"], "authors": ["Britta Meixner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meixner:Britta", "Stefan John.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/John:Stefan", "Christian Handschigl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Handschigl:Christian"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
