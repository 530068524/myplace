In order to translate LTL to deterministic omega-automata, the traditional approach first translates the formula to a non-deterministic Buchi automaton. Then a determinization procedure such as of Safra is performed yielding a deterministic \u03c9-automaton. We present a direct translation of the ( F  , G  )-fragment of LTL into deterministic \u03c9-automata with no determinization procedure involved. Since our approach is tailored to LTL, we often avoid the typically unnecessarily large blowup caused by general determinization algorithms. We investigate the complexity of this translation and provide experimental results and compare them to the traditional method.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Jan Kret\u00ednsk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kret=iacute=nsk=yacute=:Jan", "Javier Esparza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esparza:Javier"], "pages": 16}
