However, an inherent limitation of WMC is that it only admits the inference of discrete probability distributions. In this paper, we introduce a strict generalization of WMC called weighted model integration that is based on annotating Boolean and arithmetic constraints, and combinations thereof. This methodology is shown to capture discrete, continuous and hybrid Markov networks. We then consider the task of parameter learning for a fragment of the language. An empirical evaluation demonstrates the applicability and promise of the proposal.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of Trento", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Vaishak Belle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belle:Vaishak", "Andrea Passerini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Passerini:Andrea", "Guy Van den Broeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broeck:Guy_Van_den"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
