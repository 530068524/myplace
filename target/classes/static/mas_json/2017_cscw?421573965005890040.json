{"title": "It Takes at Least Two to Tango: Understanding the Cooperative Nature of Elderly Caregiving in Latin America.", "fields": ["computer supported cooperative work", "latin americans", "separation of concerns", "aging in place", "kinship"], "abstract": "Most adult children take care of their parents as they become older. However, the way in which families articulate themselves to care for their older members depends on cultural and social factors, which are different across societies. Given these differences, the design of CSCW systems and related services to support informal elderly caregiving requires contextual understanding of the complex and diverse living experiences and needs of older adults. This paper presents a cross-generational study to better understand the cooperative nature of informal elderly caregiving in Chile and Argentina. The study results show that family members assume implicit roles to fulfill their duties, with practically no coordination and no visibility of the assumed commitments within the family network. This implies that the articulation of the elderly caregiving is inefficient, conflict prone, and unbalanced, where family members assume a separation of concerns based on gender and kinship relationship with the older adult.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Chile", "University of Chile"], "authors": ["Francisco J.
