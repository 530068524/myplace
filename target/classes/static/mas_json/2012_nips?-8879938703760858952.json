{"title": "Scaling MPE Inference for Constrained Continuous Markov Random Fields with Consensus Optimization.", "fields": ["scaling", "random field", "inference", "scalability", "graphical model"], "abstract": "Probabilistic graphical models are powerful tools for analyzing constrained, continuous domains. However, finding most-probable explanations (MPEs) in these models can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we improve the scalability of MPE inference in a class of graphical models with piecewise-linear and piecewise-quadratic dependencies and linear constraints over continuous domains. We derive algorithms based on a consensus-optimization framework and demonstrate their superior performance over state of the art. We show empirically that in a large-scale voter-preference modeling problem our algorithms scale linearly in the number of dependencies and constraints.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Aurelius LLC"], "authors": ["Stephen H.
