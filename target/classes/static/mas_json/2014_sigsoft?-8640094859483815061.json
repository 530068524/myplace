Checking satisfiability of LTL formulas is a fundamental step in removing possible errors in LTL assertions. We present in this paper Aalta, a new LTL satisfiability checker, which supports satisfiability checking for LTL over both infinite and finite traces. Aalta leverages the power of modern SAT solvers. We have conducted a comprehensive comparison between Aalta and other LTL satisfiability checkers, and the experimental results show that Aalta is very competitive. The tool is available at www.lab205.org/aalta.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "East China Normal University"], "authors": ["Jianwen Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianwen", "Yinbo Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Yinbo", "Geguang Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Geguang", "Lijun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lijun", "Jifeng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Jifeng"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
