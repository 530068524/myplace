These algorithms provide approximated solutions for multi-label energy functions via move-making approach. This approach fuses the current solution with a proposal to generate a lower-energy solution. Thus, generating the appropriate proposals is necessary for the success of the move-making approach. However, not much research efforts has been done on the generation of \u201cgood\u201d proposals, especially for non-metric energy functions. In this paper, we propose an application-independent and energy-based approach to generate \u201cgood\u201d proposals. With these proposals, we present a graph cuts-based move-making algorithm called GA-fusion (fusion with graph approximation-based proposals). Extensive experiments support that our proposal generation is effective across different classes of energy functions. The proposed algorithm outperforms others both on real and synthetic problems.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wonsik Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Wonsik", "Kyoung Mu Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kyoung_Mu"], "pages": 9}
