Existing CDCF methods adopt the substructure sharing technique that can only transfer linearly correlated knowledge between domains. In this paper, we propose the notion of Hyper-Structure Transfer (HST) that requires the rating matrices to be explained by the projections of some more complex structure, called the hyper-structure, shared by all domains, and thus allows the nonlinearly correlated knowledge between domains to be identified and transferred. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our HST models empirically.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Tsing Hua University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yan-Fu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yan=Fu", "Cheng-Yu Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Cheng=Yu", "Shan-Hung Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Shan=Hung"], "pages": 9}
