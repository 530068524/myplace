Previous related work is either fingerprint-based or model-based. In this demo, we will demonstrate a generic Fresnel Penetration Model (FPM) based real-time device-free localization system called MFDL. Using only three to four commodity Wi-Fi devices, it can localize a metal plate reflector with 6cm median error in the open space and localize a moving person with 45cm median error in an outdoor space of 36 m  2  and 50-75 cm  median error in indoor environments with a size ranging from 25 m  2  to 72 m  2 , outperforming the state-of-the-art device-free localization approaches in similar settings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Ruiyang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Ruiyang", "Hao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0035:Hao", "Dan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Dan", "Kai Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Kai", "Enze Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Enze", "Daqing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Daqing"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
