{"title": "Efficient object localization using Convolutional Networks.", "fields": ["pooling", "detector", "pose", "architecture", "offset"], "abstract": "Recent state-of-the-art performance on human-body pose estimation has been achieved with Deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNets). Traditional ConvNet architectures include pooling and sub-sampling layers which reduce computational requirements, introduce invariance and prevent over-training. These benefits of pooling come at the cost of reduced localization accuracy. We introduce a novel architecture which includes an efficient \u2018position refinement\u2019 model that is trained to estimate the joint offset location within a small region of the image. This refinement model is jointly trained in cascade with a state-of-the-art ConvNet model [21] to achieve improved accuracy in human joint location estimation. We show that the variance of our detector approaches the variance of human annotations on the FLIC [20] dataset and outperforms all existing approaches on the MPII-human-pose dataset [1].", "citation": "Citations (270)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jonathan Tompson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tompson:Jonathan", "Ross Goroshin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goroshin:Ross", "Arjun Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Arjun", "Yann LeCun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/LeCun:Yann", "Christoph Bregler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bregler:Christoph"], "pages": 9}
