SANE is based on the observation\u201cthat we validate on real-world traces\u201dthat individuals with similar interests tend to meet more often. In our approach, individuals (network members) are characterized by their interest profile, a compact representation of their interests. Through extensive experiments, we show the superiority of social-aware, stateless forwarding over existing stateful, social-aware and stateless, social-oblivious forwarding. An important byproduct of our interest-based approach is that it easily enables innovative routing primitives, such as interest-casting. An interest-casting protocol is also described, and extensively evaluated through experiments based on both real-world and synthetic mobility traces.", "citation": "Citations (188)", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "University of Catania", "Sapienza University of Rome", "IIT, CNR, Pisa, Italy"], "authors": ["Alessandro Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Alessandro", "Giacomo Morabito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morabito:Giacomo", "Paolo Santi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santi:Paolo", "Julinda Stefa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stefa:Julinda"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
