In this paper, we present our findings for how diabetes patient support groups help one another find individualized strategies for managing diabetes. Through field observations of face-to-face diabetes support groups, content analysis of an online diabetes community, and interviews, we found several help interactions that are critical in helping patients in finding individualized solutions. Those are: (1) patients  operationalize  their experiences to easily contextualize and share executable strategies; (2) operationalization has to be done within the larger context of  sharing illness trajectories ; and (3) the support groups develop common understanding towards diabetes management. We further discuss how our findings translate into design implications for supporting chronic illness patients in online community settings.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Jina Huh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huh:Jina", "Mark S.
