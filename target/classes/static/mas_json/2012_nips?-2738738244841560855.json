In particularly, we focus on the nonparanormal graphical model and provide theoretical guarantees for graph estimation consistency. In addition to new computational and theoretical analysis, we also provide an alternative view to analyze the tradeoff between computational efficiency and statistical error under a smoothing optimization framework. Numerical results on both synthetic and real datasets are provided to support our theory.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Tuo Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Tuo", "Kathryn Roeder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roeder:Kathryn", "Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Han"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
