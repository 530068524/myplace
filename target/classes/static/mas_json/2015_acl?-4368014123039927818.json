{"title": "Joint Information Extraction and Reasoning: A Scalable Statistical Relational Learning Approach.", "fields": ["inference", "probabilistic logic", "statistical relational learning", "scalability", "information extraction"], "abstract": "A standard pipeline for statistical relational learning involves two steps: one first constructs the knowledge base (KB) from text, and then performs the learning and reasoning tasks using probabilistic first-order logics. However, a key issue is that information extraction (IE) errors from text affect the quality of the KB, and propagate to the reasoning task. In this paper, we propose a statistical relational learning model for joint information extraction and reasoning. More specifically, we incorporate context-based entity extraction with structure learning (SL) in a scalable probabilistic logic framework. We then propose a latent context invention (LCI) approach to improve the performance. In experiments, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines over three real-world Wikipedia datasets from multiple domains; that joint learning and inference for IE and SL significantly improve both tasks; that latent context invention further improves the results.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["William Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:William_Yang", "William W.
