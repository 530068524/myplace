We present the first study of ARM virtualization performance on server hardware, including multicore measurements of two popular ARM and x86 hypervisors, KVM and Xen. We show how ARM hardware support for virtualization can enable much faster transitions between VMs and the hypervisor, a key hypervisor operation. However, current hypervisor designs, including both Type 1 hypervisors such as Xen and Type 2 hypervisors such as KVM, are not able to leverage this performance benefit for real application workloads. We discuss the reasons why and show that other factors related to hypervisor software design and implementation have a larger role in overall performance. Based on our measurements, we discuss changes to ARM's hardware virtualization support that can potentially bridge the gap to bring its faster VM-to-hypervisor transition mechanism to modern Type 2 hypervisors running real applications. These changes have been incorporated into the latest ARM architecture.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Christoffer Dall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dall:Christoffer", "Shih-Wei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shih=Wei", "Jin Tack Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Jin_Tack", "Jason Nieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nieh:Jason", "Georgios Koloventzos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koloventzos:Georgios"], "pages": 13}
