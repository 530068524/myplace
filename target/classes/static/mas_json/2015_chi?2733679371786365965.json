Our data come from a pointing task (N=40) carried out on five common touch surface types: public display (large, vertical, standing), tabletop (large, horizontal, seated), laptop (medium, adjustably tilted, seated), tablet (seated, in hand), and smartphone (single- and two-handed input). Ergonomics indices were calculated from biomechanical simulations of motion capture data combined with recordings of external forces. We provide an extensive dataset for researchers and report the first analyses of similarities and differences that are attributable to the different postures and movement ranges.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Aalto University", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Myroslav Bachynskyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bachynskyi:Myroslav", "Gregorio Palmas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palmas:Gregorio", "Antti Oulasvirta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oulasvirta:Antti", "J\u00fcrgen Steimle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steimle:J=uuml=rgen", "Tino Weinkauf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weinkauf:Tino"], "pages": 10}
