{"title": "Towards Fully Observable Non-Deterministic Planning as Assumption-based Automatic Synthesis.", "fields": ["observable", "special case", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Whereas previous work on non-deterministic planning has focused on characterizing (and computing) \"loopy\" but \"closed\" plans, we look here at the kind of environments that these plans are to be executed in. In particular, we provide a logical characterization of the standard \"fairness\" assumption used, and show that strong cyclic plans are correct solution concepts for fair environments. We argue then that such logical characterization allows us to recast non-deterministic planning as a reactive synthesis task, and show that for a special case, recent efficient synthesis techniques can be applied.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["RMIT University", "University of Buenos Aires"], "authors": ["Sebastian Sardi\u00f1a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sardi=ntilde=a:Sebastian", "Nicol\u00e1s D'Ippolito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=Ippolito:Nicol=aacute=s"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
