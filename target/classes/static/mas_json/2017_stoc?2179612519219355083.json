Classical works by Lovasz show that many interesting quantities have this form, including, for fixed graphs\ufffd  H , the number of  H -copies (induced or not) in an input graph\ufffd  G , and the number of homomorphisms from\ufffd  H  to  G .   We use the framework of graph motif parameters to obtain faster algorithms for counting subgraph copies of fixed graphs\ufffd  H  in host graphs\ufffd  G . More precisely, for graphs  H  on  k  edges, we show how to count subgraph copies of  H  in time  k   O ( k ) \ufffd\u00b7  n  0.174 k  +  o ( k )  by a surprisingly simple algorithm. This improves upon previously known running times, such as  O ( n  0.91 k  +  c  ) time for  k -edge matchings or  O ( n  0.46 k  +  c  ) time for  k -cycles.   Furthermore, we prove a general complexity dichotomy for evaluating graph motif parameters: Given a class  C  of such parameters, we consider the problem of evaluating  f \u00e2    C  on input graphs  G , parameterized by the number of induced subgraphs that  f  depends upon. For every recursively enumerable class  C , we prove the above problem to be either FPT or #W[1]-hard, with an explicit dichotomy criterion. This allows us to recover known dichotomies for counting subgraphs, induced subgraphs, and homomorphisms in a uniform and simplified way, together with improved lower bounds.   Finally, we extend graph motif parameters to colored subgraphs and prove a complexity trichotomy: For vertex-colored graphs  H  and  G , where  H  is from a fixed class of graphs, we want to count color-preserving  H -copies in  G . We show that this problem is either polynomial-time solvable or FPT or #W[1]-hard, and that the FPT cases indeed need FPT time under reasonable assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Saarland University", "Hungarian Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Radu Curticapean.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curticapean:Radu", "Holger Dell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dell:Holger", "D\u00e1niel Marx.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marx:D=aacute=niel"], "pages": 14}
