{"title": "On Maintaining Sensor-Actor Connectivity in Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks.", "fields": ["wireless", "graph", "key distribution in wireless sensor networks", "fault tolerance", "regular graph"], "abstract": "In wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs), a group of sensors and actors are connected by a wireless medium to perform distributed sensing and acting tasks. Sensors usually gather information in an event area and pass it on to actors, which are resource-rich devices that make decisions and perform necessary actions. Therefore, it is vital to maintain connections between sensors and actors for effective sensor- actor coordination. In this paper, we first define several sensor- actor connection requirements, including weak and strong actor-connectivity, and then propose several local solutions that put as many sensors as possible to sleep for energy saving purposes, while meeting different actor-connectivity requirements. We also prove the relationship between the proposed actor-connectivity and the connectivity in regular graphs, which helps with the implementation of the proposed solutions. Comprehensive performance analysis is conducted through simulations.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Florida Atlantic University", "Florida Atlantic University"], "authors": ["Jie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Jie", "Shuhui Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shuhui", "Mihaela Cardei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cardei:Mihaela"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 5}
