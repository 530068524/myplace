We present a general metric learning algorithm, based on the structural SVM framework, to learn a metric such that rankings of data induced by distance from a query can be optimized against various ranking measures, such as AUC, Precision-at-k, MRR, MAP or NDCG. We demonstrate experimental results on standard classification data sets, and a large-scale online dating recommendation problem.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Zhejiang University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Shandong University", "University of Amsterdam", "Deakin University", "Deakin University", "Deakin University", "Deakin University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "Tsinghua University", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "Ulster University", "Ulster University", "Ulster University"], "authors": ["Brian McFee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McFee:Brian", "Gert R.
