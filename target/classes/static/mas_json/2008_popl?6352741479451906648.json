{"title": "Extensible encoding of type hierarchies.", "fields": ["type theory", "dynamic load testing", "spacetime", "extensibility", "subtyping"], "abstract": "The  subtyping test  consists of checking whether a type  t  is a descendant of a type  r  (Agrawal et al. 1989). We study how to perform such a test efficiently, assuming a  dynamic  hierarchy when new types are inserted at run-time. The goal is to achieve time and space efficiency, even as new types are inserted. We propose an  extensible  scheme, named  ESE , that ensures (1) efficient insertion of new types, (2) efficient subtyping tests, and (3) small space usage. On the one hand ESE provides comparable test times to the most efficient existing static schemes (e.g.,Zibin et al. (2001)). On the other hand, ESE has comparable insertion times to the most efficient existing dynamic scheme (Baehni et al. 2007), while ESE outperforms it by a factor of 2-3 times in terms of space usage.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Hamed Seiied Alavi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alavi:Hamed_Seiied", "Seth Gilbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilbert:Seth", "Rachid Guerraoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerraoui:Rachid"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
