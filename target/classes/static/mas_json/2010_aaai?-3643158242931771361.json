Due to the complexity of the images and the limitation of segmentation algorithms, there are always a large number of noisy pixels in the segmented binary images. In this paper, we present an approach based on ant colony system (ACS) to detect nonparametric curves from a binary image containing discontinuous curves and noisy points. Compared with the well-known Hough transform (HT) method, the ACS-based curve extraction approach can deal with both regular and irregular curves without knowing their shapes in advance. The proposed approach has many characteristics such as faster convergence, implicit parallelism and strong ability to deal with highly-noised images. Moreover, our approach can extract multiple curves from an image, which is impossible for the previous genetic algorithm based approach. Experimental results show that the proposed ACS-based approach is effective and efficient.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Qing Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Qing", "Qing He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Qing", "Zhongzhi Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Zhongzhi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
