In this paper, we successfully apply an evolutionary methodology to automatically synthesize domain-adaptive holistic descriptors for the task of scene recognition, instead of using hand-tuned descriptors. We address this as an optimization problem by using multi-objective genetic programming (MOGP). Specifically, a set of primitive operators and filters are first randomly assembled in theMOGP framework as tree-based combinations, which are then evaluated by two objective fitness criteria i.e., the classification error and the tree complexity. Finally, the best-so-far solution selected by MOGP is regarded as the (near-)optimal feature descriptor for scene recognition. We have evaluated our approach on three realistic scene datasets: MIT urban and nature, SUN and UIUC Sport. Experimental results consistently show that our MOGP-generated descriptors achieve significantly higher recognition accuracies compared with state-of-the-art hand-crafted and machine-learned features.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "University of Sheffield", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Li Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0004:Li", "Ling Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao_0001:Ling", "Xuelong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xuelong"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
