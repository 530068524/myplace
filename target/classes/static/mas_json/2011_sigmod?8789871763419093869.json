{"title": "DBWiki: a structured wiki for curated data and collaborative data management.", "fields": ["data management", "data curation", "annotation", "software versioning", "data model"], "abstract": "Wikis have proved enormously successful as a means to collaborate in the creation and publication of textual information. At the same time, a large number of curated databases have been developed through collaboration for the dissemination of structured data in specific domains, particularly bioinformatics. We demonstrate a general-purpose platform for collaborative data management, DBWiki, designed to achieve the best of both worlds. Our system not only facilitates the collaborative creation of a database; it also provides features not usually provided by database technology such as versioning, provenance tracking, citability, and annotation. In our demonstration we will show how DBWiki makes it easy to create, correct, discuss and query structured data, placing more power in the hands of users while managing tedious details of data curation automatically.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "Hobart Corporation"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Peter Buneman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buneman:Peter", "James Cheney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheney:James", "Sam Lindley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindley:Sam", "Heiko M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Heiko"], "pages": 4}
