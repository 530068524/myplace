We prove a PAC bound on the performance of SQL, which shows that for an MDP with n state-action pairs and the discount factor \u03b3 only T = O(log(n)/(e2(1 \u2013 \u03b3)4)) steps are required for the SQL algorithm to converge to an ?-optimal action-value function with high probability. This bound has a better dependency on 1/e and 1/(1 2\u2013 \u03b3), and thus, is tighter than the best available result for Q-learning. Our bound is also superior to the existing results for both model-free and model-based instances of batch Q-value iteration that are considered to be more efficient than the incremental methods like Q-learning.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Radboud University Nijmegen", "Radboud University Nijmegen", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Azar:Mohammad_Gheshlaghi", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi", "Mohammad Ghavamzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghavamzadeh:Mohammad", "Hilbert J.
