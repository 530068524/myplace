{"title": "A segmentation-aware object detection model with occlusion handling.", "fields": ["viola jones object detection framework", "object model", "minimum bounding box", "inference", "method"], "abstract": "The bounding box representation employed by many popular object detection models [3, 6] implicitly assumes all pixels inside the box belong to the object. This assumption makes this representation less robust to the object with occlusion [16]. In this paper, we augment the bounding box with a set of binary variables each of which corresponds to a cell indicating whether the pixels in the cell belong to the object. This segmentation-aware representation explicitly models and accounts for the supporting pixels for the object within the bounding box thus more robust to occlusion. We learn the model in a structured output framework, and develop a method that efficiently performs both inference and learning using this rich representation. The method is able to use segmentation reasoning to achieve improved detection results with richer output (cell level segmentation) on the Street Scenes and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets. Finally, we present a globally coherent object model using our rich representation to account for object-object occlusion resulting in a more coherent image understanding.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tianshi Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Tianshi", "Benjamin Packer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Packer:Benjamin", "Daphne Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Daphne"], "pages": 8}
