{"title": "Training Classifiers with Natural Language Explanations.", "fields": ["binary classification", "natural language", "classifier", "relationship extraction", "parsing"], "abstract": "Training accurate classifiers requires many labels, but each label provides only limited information (one bit for binary classification). In this work, we propose BabbleLabble, a framework for training classifiers in which an annotator provides a natural language explanation for each labeling decision. A semantic parser converts these explanations into programmatic labeling functions that generate noisy labels for an arbitrary amount of unlabeled data, which is used to train a classifier. On three relation extraction tasks, we find that users are able to train classifiers with comparable F1 scores from 5-100$\\times$ faster by providing explanations instead of just labels. Furthermore, given the inherent imperfection of labeling functions, we find that a simple rule-based semantic parser suffices.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy", "Christopher R\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=eacute=:Christopher", "Braden Hancock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hancock:Braden", "Paroma Varma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varma:Paroma", "Stephanie Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Stephanie", "Martin Bringmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bringmann:Martin"], "pages": 12}
