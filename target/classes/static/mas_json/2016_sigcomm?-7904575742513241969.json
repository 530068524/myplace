{"title": "AC/DC TCP: Virtual Congestion Control Enforcement for Datacenter Networks.", "fields": ["h tcp", "tcp hole punching", "compound tcp", "tcp friendly rate control", "zeta tcp"], "abstract": "Multi-tenant datacenters are successful because tenants can seamlessly port their applications and services to the cloud. Virtual Machine (VM) technology plays an integral role in this success by enabling a diverse set of software to be run on a unified underlying framework. This flexibility, however, comes at the cost of dealing with out-dated, inefficient, or misconfigured TCP stacks implemented in the VMs. This paper investigates if administrators can take control of a VM's TCP congestion control algorithm without making changes to the VM or network hardware. We propose AC/DC TCP, a scheme that exerts fine-grained control over arbitrary tenant TCP stacks by enforcing per-flow congestion control in the virtual switch (vSwitch). Our scheme is light-weight, flexible, scalable and can police non-conforming flows. In our evaluation the computational overhead of AC/DC TCP is less than one percentage point and we show implementing an administrator-defined congestion control algorithm in the vSwitch (i.e., DCTCP) closely tracks its native performance, regardless of the VM's TCP stack.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Keqiang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Keqiang", "Eric Rozner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rozner:Eric", "Kanak Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Kanak", "Yu (Jason) Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Yu_=Jason=", "Wes Felter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felter:Wes", "John B.
