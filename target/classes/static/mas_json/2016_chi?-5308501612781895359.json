Recent work suggests that discovering a filtering algorithm's existence in a curated feed influences user experience, but it remains unclear how users reason about the operation of these algorithms. In this qualitative laboratory study, researchers interviewed a diverse, non-probability sample of 40 Facebook users before, during, and after being presented alternative displays of Facebook's News Feed curation algorithm's output. Interviews revealed 10 \"folk theories' of automated curation, some quite unexpected. Users who were given a probe into the algorithm's operation via an interface that incorporated \"seams,' visible hints disclosing aspects of automation operations, could quickly develop theories. Users made plans that depended on their theories. We conclude that foregrounding these automated processes may increase interface design complexity, but it may also add usability benefits.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Michigan", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "California State University, Fresno"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Motahhare Eslami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eslami:Motahhare", "Karrie Karahalios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karahalios:Karrie", "Christian Sandvig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sandvig:Christian", "Kristen Vaccaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaccaro:Kristen", "Aimee Rickman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rickman:Aimee", "Kevin Hamilton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamilton:Kevin", "Alex Kirlik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirlik:Alex"], "pages": 12}
