{"title": "Larger-Context Language Modelling with Recurrent Neural Network.", "fields": ["perplexity", "treebank", "noun", "recurrent neural network", "language model"], "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel method to incorporate corpus-level discourse information into language modelling. We call this larger-context language model. We introduce a late fusion approach to a recurrent language model based on long shortterm memory units (LSTM), which helps the LSTM unit keep intra-sentence dependencies and inter-sentence dependencies separate from each other. Through the evaluation on four corpora (IMDB, BBC, Penn TreeBank, and Fil9), we demonstrate that the proposed model improves perplexity significantly. In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed approach while varying the number of context sentences and observe that the proposed late fusion is superior to the usual way of incorporating additional inputs to the LSTM. By analyzing the trained larger-context language model, we discover that content words, including nouns, adjectives and verbs, benefit most from an increasing number of context sentences. This analysis suggests that larger-context language model improves the unconditional language model by capturing the theme of a document better and more easily.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Tian Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Tian", "Kyunghyun Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Kyunghyun"], "pages": -1}
