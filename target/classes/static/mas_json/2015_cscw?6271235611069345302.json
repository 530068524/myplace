{"title": "PaperChains: Dynamic Sketch+Voice Annotations.", "fields": ["usability", "sketch", "digital audio", "storytelling", "literacy"], "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel interface for collaborative creation of evolving audio-visual documents.  PaperChains  allows users to sketch on paper and then augment with digital audio, allowing both the physical and digital objects to evolve simultaneously over time. The technique we have developed focuses on affordability and accessibility in its design, using standard cameraphones and telephone connections, which allow it to be used in regions where literacy, technological experience and data connections cannot necessarily be taken for granted. The main use-case that we focus on in this paper is for collaborative storytelling, an area which has been well studied and previously proven to be of value in resource constrained environments. To investigate the relevance of the approach in these contexts, we undertook two usability evaluations in India and South Africa. Results from these investigations indicate users' ability to both create and interpret stories using the software, as well as demonstrating high overall usability and enjoyment. We end with a discussion of the implications of our design and opportunities for use in other contexts.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Swansea University", "Swansea University", "Swansea University"], "authors": ["Jennifer Pearson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pearson_0001:Jennifer", "Simon Robinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robinson:Simon", "Matt Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones_0001:Matt"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
