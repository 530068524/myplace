In process planning, abstract manufacturing tasks in a process recipe are matched to available manufacturing resources, e.g., CNC machines and robots, to give an executable process plan. A process plan controller then delegates each operation in the plan to specific manufacturing resources. In this paper we present an approach to the automated computation of process plans and process plan controllers. We extend previous work to support both nondeterministic (i.e., partially controllable) resources, and to allow operations to be performed in parallel on the same part. We show how implicit fairness assumptions can be captured in this setting, and how this impacts the definition of process plans.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Paolo Felli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felli:Paolo", "Lavindra de Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silva:Lavindra_de", "Brian Logan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Logan:Brian", "Svetan M.
