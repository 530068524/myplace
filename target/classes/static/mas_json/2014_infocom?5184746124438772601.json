In this paper, we explore the throughput-delay tradeoff in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) operating under the RPGM model and also a general setting of node moving speed. In par- ticular, we consider a MANET with unit area and n nodes being divided evenly into \u0398(n \u03b1 ) groups, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), where the center of each group moves according to a random direction model with speed no more than \u03c5 \u2208 (0, 1). We determine the regions of per node throughput, average delay and their tradeoffs that can be achieved (in order sense) in such a network. For the regime of \u03c5 =0 , we first prove that the per node throughput capacity is \u0398(n \u2212\u03b1/2 ), and then develop a routing scheme to achieve this capacity, resulting an average delay of \u0398(max{n 1/2 ,n 1\u2212\u03b1 }) for any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). Regarding the regime of \u03c5> 0, we prove that the per node throughput capacity there can be improved to \u0398(1), which is achievable by adopting a new routing scheme with an average delay of \u0398(max{n 1\u2212\u03b1 ,n \u03b1/2 /\u03c5}) for \u03c5 = o(1) and \u0398(n) for \u03c5 =\u0398 (1). The results in this paper help us to have a deep understanding on the fundamental performance scaling laws and also enable an efficient throughput-delay tradeoff to be achieved in MANETs with correlated mobility.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Tohoku University", "Tohoku University", "Tohoku University", "Xidian University", "Future University Hakodate"], "authors": ["Jiajia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jiajia", "Hiroki Nishiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishiyama:Hiroki", "Nei Kato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kato:Nei", "Jianfeng Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Jianfeng", "Xiaohong Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Xiaohong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
