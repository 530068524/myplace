{"title": "Non-Preemptive Buffer Management for Latency Sensitive Packets.", "fields": ["link state packet", "bufferbloat", "out of order delivery", "packet drop attack", "packet generator"], "abstract": "The delivery of latency sensitive packets is a crucial issue in real-time applications of communication networks. Such packets often have a firm deadline and a packet becomes useless if it arrives after its deadline. The deadline, however, applies only to the packet's journey through the entire network; individual routers along the packet's route face a more flexible deadline. We study policies for admitting latency sensitive packets at a router. Each packet is tagged with a value. A packet waiting at a router loses value over time as its probability of arriving at its destination on time decreases. The router is modeled as a non-preemptive queue, and its objective is to maximize the total value of the forwarded packets. When a router receives a packet, it must either accept it (and delay future packets), or reject it immediately. The best policy depends on the set of values that a packet can take. We consider three natural sets: an unrestricted model, a real-valued model, where any value over 1 is allowed, and an integral-valued model. For the unrestricted model, we prove that there is no constant competitive ratio algorithm. For the real-valued model, we give a randomized 4-competitive algorithm and a matching lower bound (up to low order terms). We also provide a deterministic lower bound of $$\\phi ^3 - {\\varepsilon }\\approx 4.236$$\u017a3-\u017a\u017a4.236, almost matching the previously known 4.24-competitive algorithm. For the integral-valued model, we describe a deterministic 4-competitive algorithm, and prove that this is tight even for randomized algorithms (up to low order terms).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Open University of Israel", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Moran Feldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldman:Moran", "Joseph Naor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naor:Joseph"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
