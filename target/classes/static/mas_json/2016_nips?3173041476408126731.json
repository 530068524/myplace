Clustering with Bregman divergences is a recently proposed generalization of $k$-means clustering which has already been widely used in applications. In this paper we analyze theoretical properties of Bregman clustering when the number of the clusters $k$ is large. We establish quantization rates and describe the limiting distribution of the centers as $k\\to \\infty$, extending well-known results for $k$-means clustering.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Chaoyue Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chaoyue", "Mikhail Belkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belkin:Mikhail"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
