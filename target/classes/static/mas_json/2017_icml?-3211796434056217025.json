Our approach, called adaptive softmax, circumvents the linear dependency on the vocabulary size by exploiting the unbalanced word distribution to form clusters that explicitly minimize the expectation of computational complexity. Our approach further reduces the computational cost by exploiting the specificities of modern architectures and matrix-matrix vector operations, making it particularly suited for graphical processing units. Our experiments carried out on standard benchmarks, such as EuroParl and One Billion Word, show that our approach brings a large gain in efficiency over standard approximations while achieving an accuracy close to that of the full softmax.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Edouard Grave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grave:Edouard", "Armand Joulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joulin:Armand", "Moustapha Ciss\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciss=eacute=:Moustapha", "David Grangier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grangier:David", "Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=eacute=gou:Herv=eacute="], "pages": 9}
