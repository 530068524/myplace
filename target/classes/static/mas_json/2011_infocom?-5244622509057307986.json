Most existing literature employs supervised learning techniques and assumes the number of devices is known. In this paper, based on device-dependent channel-invariant radio-metrics, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian method to detect the number of devices as well as classify multiple devices in a unsupervised passive manner. Specifically, the infinite Gaussian mixture model is used and a modified collapsed Gibbs sampling method is proposed. Sybil attacks and Masquerade attacks are investigated. We have proven the effectiveness of the proposed method by both simulation data and experimental measurements obtained by USRP2 and Zigbee devices.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["University of Houston", "University of Houston", "University of Houston", "University of Houston"], "authors": ["Nam Tuan Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Nam_Tuan", "Guanbo Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Guanbo", "Zhu Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Zhu", "Rong Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Rong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
