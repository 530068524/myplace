{"title": "Shaping Social Activity by Incentivizing Users.", "fields": ["text mining", "multivariate statistics", "convex optimization", "social network", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Events in an online social network can be categorized roughly into endogenous events, where users just respond to the actions of their neighbors within the network, or exogenous events, where users take actions due to drives external to the network. How much external drive should be provided to each user, such that the network activity can be steered towards a target state? In this paper, we model social events using multivariate Hawkes processes, which can capture both endogenous and exogenous event intensities, and derive a time dependent linear relation between the intensity of exogenous events and the overall network activity. Exploiting this connection, we develop a convex optimization framework for determining the required level of external drive in order for the network to reach a desired activity level. We experimented with event data gathered from Twitter, and show that our method can steer the activity of the network more accurately than alternatives.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Carlos III Health Institute", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "MPI for Software Systems"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Mehrdad Farajtabar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farajtabar:Mehrdad", "Nan Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Nan", "Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gomez=Rodriguez:Manuel", "Isabel Valera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valera:Isabel", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le"], "pages": 9}
