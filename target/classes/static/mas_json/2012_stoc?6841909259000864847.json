We show that  B  is computationally indistinguishable from a random variable of higher Shannon entropy given  X  if and only if there is no probabilistic polynomial-time S such that (X,S(X)) has small KL divergence from (X,B). This can be viewed as an analogue of the Impagliazzo Hardcore Theorem (FOCS '95) for Shannon entropy (rather than min-entropy).   Using this characterization, we show that if f is a one-way function, then (f(U n ),U n ) has \"next-bit pseudoentropy\" at least n+log n, establishing a conjecture of Haitner, Reingold, and Vadhan (STOC '10). Plugging this into the construction of Haitner et al., this yields a simpler construction of pseudorandom generators from one-way functions. In particular, the construction only performs hashing once, and only needs the hash functions that are randomness extractors (e.g. universal hash functions) rather than needing them to support \"local list-decoding\" (as in the Goldreich--Levin hardcore predicate, STOC '89).   With an additional idea, we also show how to improve the seed length of the pseudorandom generator to ~{O}(n 3 ), compared to O(n 4 ) in the construction of Haitner et al.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Salil P.
