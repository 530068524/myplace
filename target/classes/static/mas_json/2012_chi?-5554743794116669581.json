{"title": "iRotate: automatic screen rotation based on face orientation.", "fields": ["face detection", "rotation", "mobile device", "artificial intelligence", "computer vision"], "abstract": "We present iRotate, an approach to automatically rotate screens on mobile devices to match users' face orientation. Current approaches to automatic screen rotation are based on gravity and device orientation. Our survey of 513 users shows that 42% currently experience auto-rotation that leads to incorrect viewing orientation several times a week or more, and 24% find the problem to be very serious to extremely serious. iRotate augments gravity-based approach, and uses front cameras on mobile devices to detect users' faces and rotates screens accordingly. It requires no explicit user input and supports different user postures and device orientations. We have implemented a iRotate that works in real-time on iPhone and iPad, and we assess the accuracy and limitations of iRotate through a 20- participant feasibility study.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Lung-Pan Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Lung=Pan", "Fang-I Hsiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsiao:Fang=I", "Yen-Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yen=Ting", "Mike Y.
