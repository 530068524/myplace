{"title": "How useful are your comments?: analyzing and predicting youtube comments and comment ratings.", "fields": ["world wide web", "data mining", "computer science", "wordnet", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "An analysis of the social video sharing platform YouTube reveals a high amount of community feedback through comments for published videos as well as through meta ratings for these comments. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of commenting and comment rating behavior on a sample of more than 6 million comments on 67,000 YouTube videos for which we analyzed dependencies between comments, views, comment ratings and topic categories. In addition, we studied the influence of sentiment expressed in comments on the ratings for these comments using the SentiWordNet thesaurus, a lexical WordNet-based resource containing sentiment annotations. Finally, to predict community acceptance for comments not yet rated, we built different classifiers for the estimation of ratings for these comments. The results of our large-scale evaluations are promising and indicate that community feedback on already rated comments can help to filter new unrated comments or suggest particularly useful but still unrated comments.", "citation": "Citations (260)", "departments": ["Telef\u00f3nica", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany"], "authors": ["Stefan Siersdorfer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siersdorfer:Stefan", "Sergiu Chelaru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chelaru:Sergiu", "Wolfgang Nejdl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nejdl:Wolfgang", "Jos\u00e9 San Pedro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedro:Jos=eacute=_San"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
