{"title": "Segmentation and Indexing of Endoscopic Videos.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "computer vision", "multimedia", "artificial intelligence", "metadata"], "abstract": "Over the last few years it has become common to archive video recordings of endoscopic surgeries. These videos are of high value for medics, junior doctors, patients and hospital management but currently they are used rarely or not at all. Each day tens to hundreds of hours of new videos are added to archives without metadata that would support content-based search. In order to fully utilize these videos it is necessary to analyze the content of the recordings. Endoscopic videos are in some aspects fundamentally different to other types of videos. Therefore, pre-existing content-based analysis methods must be tested for their ability to operate with this kind of video and, if required, they must be adopted or new methods must be found. Especially, we address video segmentation and indexing in this work. We present our preliminary work and ideas for future work to add content-based information to endoscopic videos.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Institute of In ... nfurt, Austria"], "authors": ["Manfred J\u00fcrgen Primus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Primus:Manfred_J=uuml=rgen"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
