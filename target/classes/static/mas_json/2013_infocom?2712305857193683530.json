With the development in broadband accesses, video has become one of the most important types of objects spreading among social networking service users, yet presents more significant challenges than other types of objects, not only to the SNS management, but also to the network traffic engineering. In this paper, we take an important step towards understanding the characteristics of video sharing propagation in SNS, based on the real viewing event traces from a popular SNS in China. We further extend the epidemic models to accommodate the diversity of the propagation, and our model effectively captures the propagation process of video sharing in SNS.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Xu Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xu", "Haitao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Haitao", "Jiangchuan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jiangchuan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
