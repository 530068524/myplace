{"title": "From Deformations to Parts: Motion-based Segmentation of 3D Objects.", "fields": ["gibbs sampling", "nonparametric statistics", "chinese restaurant process", "polygon mesh", "affine transformation"], "abstract": "We develop a method for discovering the parts of an articulated object from aligned meshes of the object in various three-dimensional poses. We adapt the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP) to allow nonparametric discovery of a potentially unbounded number of parts, while simultaneously guaranteeing a spatially connected segmentation. To allow analysis of datasets in which object instances have varying 3D shapes, we model part variability across poses via affine transformations. By placing a matrix normal-inverse-Wishart prior on these affine transformations, we develop a ddCRP Gibbs sampler which tractably marginalizes over transformation uncertainty. Analyzing a dataset of humans captured in dozens of poses, we infer parts which provide quantitatively better deformation predictions than conventional clustering methods.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Brown University", "Max Planck Society", "Brown University", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Soumya Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Soumya", "Erik B.
