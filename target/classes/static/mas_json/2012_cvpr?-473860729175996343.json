This paper proposes an algorithm for detecting the regions of interest of surfaces. It looks for regions that are distinct both locally and globally and accounts for the distance to the foci of attention. Many applications can utilize these regions. In this paper we explore one such application \u2014 viewpoint selection. The most informative views are those that collectively provide the most descriptive presentation of the surface. We show that our results compete favorably with the state-of-the-art results.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["George Leifman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leifman:George", "Elizabeth Shtrom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shtrom:Elizabeth", "Ayellet Tal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tal:Ayellet"], "pages": 8}
