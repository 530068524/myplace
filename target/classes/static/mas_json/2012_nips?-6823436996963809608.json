The method is designed to make predictions using information from as many brain locations as possible, instead of resorting to feature selection, and does this by decomposing the pattern of brain activation into differently informative sub-regions. We provide results over a complex semantic processing dataset that show that the method is competitive with state-of-the-art feature selection and also suggest how the method may be used to perform group or exploratory analyses of complex class structure.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Francisco Pereira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pereira:Francisco", "Matthew Botvinick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Botvinick:Matthew"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
