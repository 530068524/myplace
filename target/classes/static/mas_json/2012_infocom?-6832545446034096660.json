By formulating a total cost minimization that allows for a flexible tradeoff between delay and energy, we first study how to adaptively vary the processing speed based on incoming load. We then investigate how this speedscaling affects the design of network protocol, specifically, with respect to user association. Based on our investigation, we propose and analyze a distributed algorithm, called SpeedBalance, that can yield significant energy savings.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Kyuho Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:Kyuho", "Bhaskar Krishnamachari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamachari:Bhaskar"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
