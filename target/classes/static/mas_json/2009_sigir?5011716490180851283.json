First, the re-ranking model computes the maximum posterior probability of the hidden property corresponding to each retrieved passage. Then it iteratively groups the passages into subsets according to their properties. Finally, these passages are re-ranked from the subsets as our output. There is no need for our proposed method to use any external biomedical resource. We evaluate our Bayesian learning approach by conducting extensive experiments on the TREC 2004-2007 Genomics data sets. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian learning approach for promoting diversity in ranking for biomedical information retrieval on four years TREC data sets.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["York University", "York University"], "authors": ["Xiangji Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Xiangji", "Qinmin Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Qinmin"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
