A router that does not respond to a traceroute query is referred to as an anonymous router and is represented by a '*' in the traceroute output. Anonymous router resolution refers to the task of identifying the occurrences of '*'s that belong to the same router in the underlying network. This task is an important step in building traceroute-based topology maps and obtaining an optimum solution is shown to be NP-complete. In this paper, we use a novel technique from graph data mining field to build an efficient solution. The results of our experiments on both synthetic and genuine topologies show a significant improvement in accuracy and effectiveness over the existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Mehmet Hadi Gunes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gunes:Mehmet_Hadi", "Kamil Sara\u00e7.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sara=ccedil=:Kamil"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
