In detail, a phrasal paraphrase table and a feature function are derived from each resource, which are then combined in a log-linear SMT model for sentence-level paraphrase generation. Experimental results show that the SMT-based paraphrasing model can be enhanced using multiple resources. The phrase-level and sentence-level precision of the generated paraphrases are above 60% and 55%, respectively. In addition, the contribution of each resource is evaluated, which indicates that all the exploited resources are useful for generating paraphrases of high quality.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shiqi Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shiqi", "Cheng Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Cheng", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Ming", "Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ting", "Sheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Sheng"], "pages": 9}
