Classical approaches for self-calibration of a multi-camera system fail to calibrate such a system due to the very different image modalities. In addition, the typical environments of multi-camera systems are man-made and consist primary of only low textured objects. However, at the same time they satisfy the Manhattan-world assumption. We formulate the multi-modal sensor network calibration as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) problem and solve it by minimizing the corresponding energy function. First we estimate two separate 3D reconstructions of the environment: one using the pan-tilt unit mounted ToF camera and one using the multi-camera system. We exploit the Manhattan-world assumption and estimate multiple initial calibration hypotheses by registering the three dominant orientations of planes. These hypotheses are used as prior knowledge of a subsequent MAP estimation aiming to align edges that are parallel to these dominant directions. To our knowledge, this is the first self-calibration approach that is able to calibrate a ToF camera with a multi-camera system. Quantitative experiments on real data demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Jena", "University of Jena"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Marcel Br\u00fcckner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Br=uuml=ckner:Marcel", "Joachim Denzler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denzler:Joachim"], "pages": 6}
