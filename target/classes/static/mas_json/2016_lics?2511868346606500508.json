{"title": "Reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures, and lifting tractability from finite-domain constraint satisfaction.", "fields": ["bounded function", "conjecture", "generalization", "constraint satisfaction problem", "subclass"], "abstract": "Many natural decision problems can be formulated as constraint satisfaction problems for reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures. This class of problems is a large generalisation of the class of CSPs over finite domains. Our first result is a general polynomial-time reduction from such infinite-domain CSPs to finite-domain CSPs. We use this reduction to obtain new powerful polynomial-time tractability conditions that can be expressed in terms of topological polymorphism clones. Moreover, we study the subclass C of CSPs for structures that are first-order definable over equality with parameters. Also this class C properly extends the class of all finite-domain CSPs. We show that the tractability conjecture for reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures is for C equivalent to the finite-domain tractability conjecture.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Manuel Bodirsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bodirsky:Manuel", "Antoine Mottet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mottet:Antoine"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
