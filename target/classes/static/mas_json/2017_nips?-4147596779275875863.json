Generally, approaches have relied on control variates to reduce the variance of the REINFORCE estimator. Recent work \\citep{jang2016categorical, maddison2016concrete} has taken a different approach, introducing a continuous relaxation of discrete variables to produce low-variance, but biased, gradient estimates. In this work, we combine the two approaches through a novel control variate that produces low-variance, \\emph{unbiased} gradient estimates. Then, we introduce a modification to the continuous relaxation and show that the tightness of the relaxation can be adapted online, removing it as a hyperparameter. We show state-of-the-art variance reduction on several benchmark generative modeling tasks, generally leading to faster convergence to a better final log-likelihood.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "University of Oxford", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["George Tucker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tucker:George", "Andriy Mnih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mnih:Andriy", "Chris J.
