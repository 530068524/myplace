In this paper we studied content recommendation on Twitter to better direct user attention. In a modular approach, we explored three separate dimensions in designing such a recommender: content sources, topic interest models for users, and social voting. We implemented 12 recommendation engines in the design space we formulated, and deployed them to a recommender service on the web to gather feedback from real Twitter users. The best performing algorithm improved the percentage of interesting content to 72% from a baseline of 33%. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of our recommender design and how our design can generalize to other information streams.", "citation": "Citations (478)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "PARC", "PARC", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "PARC"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jilin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jilin", "Rowan Nairn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nairn:Rowan", "Les Nelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nelson:Les", "Michael S.
