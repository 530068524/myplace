Considering that each filter in a conv-layer of a pre-trained CNN usually represents a mixture of object parts, we propose a simple yet efficient method to automatically disentangles different part patterns from each filter, and construct an explanatory graph. In the explanatory graph, each node represents a part pattern, and each edge encodes co-activation relationships and spatial relationships between patterns. More importantly, we learn the explanatory graph for a pre-trained CNN in an unsupervised manner, i.e., without a need of annotating object parts. Experiments show that each graph node consistently represents the same object part through different images. We transfer part patterns in the explanatory graph to the task of part localization, and our method significantly outperforms other approaches.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of California", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Quanshi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Quanshi", "Ruiming Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Ruiming", "Feng Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Feng", "Ying Nian Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ying_Nian", "Song-Chun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Song=Chun"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
