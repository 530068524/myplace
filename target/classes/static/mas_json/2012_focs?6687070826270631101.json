We present a combinatorial algorithm getting down to O(n^{4/11}) colors. This is the first combinatorial improvement of Blum's O(n^{3/8}) bound from FOCS'90. Like Blum's algorithm, our new algorithm composes nicely with recent semi-definite programming approaches. The current best bound is O(n^{0. 2072}) colors by Chlamtac from FOCS'07. We now bring it down to O(n^{0. 2049}) colors.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "Nat.
