In this paper, we present MReliefF and MF-statistic algorithms for multi-label feature selections. Discriminant features are selected to boost the multi-label classification accuracy. The proposed MReliefF and MF-statistic can be used in image categorization and annotation problems. Extensive experiments on image annotation tasks show the good performance of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first work to generalize the ReliefF and F-statistic feature selection algorithms for multi-label image annotation tasks.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "Anhui University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Deguang Kong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kong:Deguang", "Chris H.
