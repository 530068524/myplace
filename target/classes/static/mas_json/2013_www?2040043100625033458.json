Consequently REST gains popularity with a resource-centric interaction architecture that draws its flexibility from links between resources. Linked Data offers a uniform data model for REST with self-descriptive resources that can be leveraged to avoid a manual ad-hoc development of web-based applications. For declaratively specifying interactions between web resources we introduce  Data-Fu , a lightweight declarative rule language with state transition systems as formal grounding. Data-Fu enables the development of data-driven applications that facilitate the RESTful manipulation of read/write Linked Data resources. Furthermore, we describe an interpreter for Data-Fu as a general purpose engine that allows to perform described interactions with web resources by orders of magnitude faster than a comparable Linked Data processor.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Steffen Stadtm\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stadtm=uuml=ller:Steffen", "Sebastian Speiser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Speiser:Sebastian", "Andreas Harth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harth:Andreas", "Rudi Studer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Studer:Rudi"], "conf": "www", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
