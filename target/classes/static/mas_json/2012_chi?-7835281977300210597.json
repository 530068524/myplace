{"title": "Uncomfortable interactions.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "climax", "multimedia", "voyeurism", "entertainment"], "abstract": "We argue for deliberately and systematically creating uncomfortable interactions as part of powerful cultural experiences. We identify the potential benefits of uncomfortable interactions under the general headings of entertainment, enlightenment and sociality. We then review artworks and performances that have employed discomfort, including two complementary examples from the worlds of entertainment and performance. From this, we articulate a suite of tactics for designing four primary forms of discomfort referred to as visceral, cultural, control and intimate. We discuss how moments of discomfort need to be embedded into an overall experience which requires a further consideration of the dramatic acts of exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement. Finally, we discuss an ethical framework for uncomfortable interactions which leads us to revisit key issues of consent, withdrawal, privacy and risk.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Exeter", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Steve Benford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benford:Steve", "Chris Greenhalgh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenhalgh:Chris", "Gabriella Giannachi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giannachi:Gabriella", "Brendan Walker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walker:Brendan", "Joe Marshall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marshall:Joe", "Tom Rodden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodden:Tom"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
