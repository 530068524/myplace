We propose spatially structured Vector Autoregressions (VARs) for modelling the process between changepoints (CPs) and give an upper bound on the approximation error of such models. The resulting algorithm performs prediction, model selection and CP detection on-line. Its time complexity is linear and its space complexity constant, and thus it is two orders of magnitudes faster than its closest competitor. In addition, it outperforms the state of the art for multivariate data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "University of Warwick"], "authors": ["Jeremias Knoblauch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knoblauch:Jeremias", "Theodoros Damoulas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damoulas:Theodoros"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
