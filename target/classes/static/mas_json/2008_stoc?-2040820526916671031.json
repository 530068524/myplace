{"title": "A learning theory approach to non-interactive database privacy.", "fields": ["concept class", "vc dimension", "synthetic data", "information privacy", "differential privacy"], "abstract": "We demonstrate that, ignoring computational constraints, it is possible to release privacy-preserving databases that are useful for all queries over a discretized domain from any given concept class with polynomial VC-dimension. We show a new lower bound for releasing databases that are useful for halfspace queries over a continuous domain. Despite this, we give a privacy-preserving polynomial time algorithm that releases information useful for all halfspace queries, for a slightly relaxed definition of usefulness. Inspired by learning theory, we introduce a new notion of data privacy, which we call distributional privacy, and show that it is strictly stronger than the prevailing privacy notion, differential privacy.", "citation": "Citations (513)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Avrim Blum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blum:Avrim", "Katrina Ligett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ligett:Katrina", "Aaron Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Aaron"], "pages": 10}
