{"title": "Availability in Globally Distributed Storage Systems.", "fields": ["information repository", "data availability", "distributed data store", "cloud storage", "converged storage"], "abstract": "Highly available cloud storage is often implemented with complex, multi-tiered distributed systems built on top of clusters of commodity servers and disk drives. Sophisticated management, load balancing and recovery techniques are needed to achieve high performance and availability amidst an abundance of failure sources that include software, hardware, network connectivity, and power issues. While there is a relative wealth of failure studies of individual components of storage systems, such as disk drives, relatively little has been reported so far on the overall availability behavior of large cloudbased storage services.\n\nWe characterize the availability properties of cloud storage systems based on an extensive one year study of Google's main storage infrastructure and present statistical models that enable further insight into the impact of multiple design choices, such as data placement and replication strategies. With these models we compare data availability under a variety of system parameters given the real patterns of failures observed in our fleet.", "citation": "Citations (485)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Daniel Ford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ford:Daniel", "Fran\u00e7ois Labelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Labelle:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Florentina I.
