{"title": "Performance Monitoring and Root Cause Analysis for Cloud-hosted Web Applications.", "fields": ["anomaly detection", "root cause", "metadata", "scalability", "web application"], "abstract": "In this paper, we describe Roots - a system for automatically identifying the \"root cause\" of performance anomalies in web applications deployed in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds. Roots does not require application-level instrumentation. Instead, it tracks events within the PaaS cloud that are triggered by application requests using a combination of metadata injection and platform-level instrumentation.\n\nWe describe the extensible architecture of Roots, a prototype implementation of the system, and a statistical methodology for performance anomaly detection and diagnosis. We evaluate the efficacy of Roots using a set of PaaS-hosted web applications, and detail the performance overhead and scalability of the implementation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Hiranya Jayathilaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jayathilaka:Hiranya", "Chandra Krintz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krintz:Chandra", "Rich Wolski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolski:Rich"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
