{"title": "Formal Verification of Hardware Synthesis.", "fields": ["compiler correctness", "hardware description language", "transactional memory", "verilog", "vhdl"], "abstract": "We report on the implementation of a certified compiler for a high-level hardware description language (HDL) called Fe-Si (FEatherweight SynthesIs). Fe-Si is a simplified version of Bluespec, an HDL based on a notion of guarded atomic actions. Fe-Si is defined as a dependently typed deep embedding in Coq. The target language of the compiler corresponds to a synthesisable subset of Verilog or VHDL. A key aspect of our approach is that input programs to the compiler can be defined and proved correct inside Coq. Then, we use extraction and a Verilog back-end (written in OCaml) to get a certified version of a hardware design.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Thomas Braibant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braibant:Thomas", "Adam Chlipala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chlipala:Adam"], "pages": 16}
