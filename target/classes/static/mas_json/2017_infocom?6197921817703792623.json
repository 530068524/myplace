In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of POWERFUL, a new attack which can fingerprint sensitive mobile apps (or infer sensitive app usage) by analyzing the power consumption profiles on Android devices. POWERFUL works on the observation that distinct apps and their different usage patterns all lead to distinguishable power consumption profiles. Since the power profiles on Android devices require no permission to access, POWERFUL is very difficult to detect and can pose a serious threat against user privacy. Extensive experiments involving popular and sensitive apps in Google Play Store show that POWERFUL can identify the app used at any particular time with accuracy up to 92.9%, demonstrating the feasibility of POWERFUL.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "University of Delaware", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Yimin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yimin", "Xiaocong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xiaocong", "Jingchao Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jingchao", "Rui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Rui", "Yanchao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanchao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
