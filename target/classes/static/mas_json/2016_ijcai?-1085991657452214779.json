{"title": "Graph-Based Factorization of Classical Planning Problems.", "fields": ["operator", "isomorphism", "graph factorization", "factorization", "partial order reduction"], "abstract": "In domain-independent planning, dependencies of operators and variables often prevent the effective application of planning techniques that rely on \"loosely coupled\" problems (like factored planning or partial order reduction). In this paper, we propose a generic approach for factorizing a classical planning problem into an equivalent problem with fewer operator and variable dependencies. Our approach is based on variable factorization, which can be reduced to the well-studied problem of graph factorization. While the state spaces of the original and the factorized problems are isomorphic, the factorization offers the potential to exponentially reduce the complexity of planning techniques like factored planning and partial order reduction.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Basel", "University of Basel", "University of Basel"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Martin Wehrle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wehrle:Martin", "Silvan Sievers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sievers:Silvan", "Malte Helmert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helmert:Malte"], "pages": 7}
