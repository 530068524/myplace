{"title": "Bayes Optimal Multilabel Classification via Probabilistic Classifier Chains.", "fields": ["multi label classification", "probabilistic classification", "probabilistic logic", "bayes theorem", "classifier chains"], "abstract": "In the realm of multilabel classification (MLC), it has become an opinio communis that optimal predictive performance can only be achieved by learners that explicitly take label dependence into account. The goal of this paper is to elaborate on this postulate in a critical way. To this end, we formalize and analyze MLC within a probabilistic setting. Thus, it becomes possible to look at the problem from the point of view of risk minimization and Bayes optimal prediction. Moreover, inspired by our probabilistic setting, we propose a new method for MLC that generalizes and outperforms another approach, called classifier chains, that was recently introduced in the literature.", "citation": "Citations (356)", "departments": ["University of Marburg", "University of Marburg", "Pozna\u0144 University of Technology", "University of Marburg"], "authors": ["Krzysztof Dembczynski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dembczynski:Krzysztof", "Weiwei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Weiwei", "Eyke H\u00fcllermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=uuml=llermeier:Eyke"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
