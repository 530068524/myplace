These algorithms are notoriously difficult to implement correctly, due to asynchronous communication and the occurrence of faults, such as the network dropping messages or computers crashing. We introduce PSync, a domain specific language based on the Heard-Of model, which views asynchronous faulty systems as synchronous ones with an adversarial environment that simulates asynchrony and faults by dropping messages. We define a runtime system for PSync that efficiently executes on asynchronous networks. We formalise the relation between the runtime system and PSync in terms of observational refinement. The high-level lockstep abstraction introduced by PSync simplifies the design and implementation of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms and enables automated formal verification. We have implemented an embedding of PSync in the Scala programming language with a runtime system for partially synchronous networks. We show the applicability of PSync by implementing several important fault-tolerant distributed algorithms and we compare the implementation of consensus algorithms in PSync against implementations in other languages in terms of code size, runtime efficiency, and verification.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Cezara Dragoi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dragoi:Cezara", "Thomas A.
