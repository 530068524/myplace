Moreover, we prove the positivity of rectangular Kronecker coefficients for a large class of partitions where the side lengths of the rectangle are at least quadratic in the length of the partition. We also compare rectangular Kronecker coefficients with their corresponding plethysm coefficients, which leads to a new lower bound for rectangular Kronecker coefficients. Moreover, we prove that the saturation of the rectangular Kronecker semigroup is trivial, we show that the rectangular Kronecker positivity stretching factor is 2 for a long first row, and we completely classify the positivity of rectangular limit Kronecker coefficients that were introduced by Manivel in 2011.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "University of Pennsylvania", "External Organizations", "External Organizations"], "authors": ["Christian Ikenmeyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikenmeyer:Christian", "Greta Panova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panova:Greta"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
