The problem of whether a given manufacturing process can be realized by a given set of manufacturing resources can then be stated as an orchestration problem for transducers. We first consider the conceptually simpler case of uni-transducers (transducers with a single input and a single output port), and show that synthesizing orchestrations for uni-transducers is EXPTIME complete. Surprisingly, the complexity remains the same for the more expressive multi-transducer case, where transducers have multiple input and output ports and the orchestration is in charge of dynamically connecting ports during execution.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Rice University", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Giuseppe De Giacomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giacomo:Giuseppe_De", "Moshe Y.
