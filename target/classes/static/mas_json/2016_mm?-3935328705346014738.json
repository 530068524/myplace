{"title": "SenseCap: Synchronized Data Collection with Microsoft Kinect2 and LeapMotion.", "fields": ["file format", "extensibility", "color space", "microsoft video 1", "license"], "abstract": "We present a new recording tool to capture synchronized video and skeletal data streams from cheap sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect2, and LeapMotion. While other recording tools act as virtual playback devices for testing on-line real-time applications, we target multi-media data collection for off-line processing. Images are encoded in common video formats, and skeletal data as flat text tables. This approach enables long duration recordings (e.g. over 30 minutes), and supports post-hoc mapping of the Kinect2 depth video to the color space if needed. By using common file formats, the data can be played back and analyzed on any other computer, without requiring sensor specific SDKs to be installed. The project is released under a 3-clause BSD license, and consists of an extensible C++11 framework, with support for the official Microsoft Kinect 2 and LeapMotion APIs to record, a command-line interface, and a Matlab GUI to initiate, inspect, and load Kinect2 recordings.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Leiden University Medical Center"], "authors": ["Julian F.
