In our budgeted social choice model, this limit is determined by a budget, capturing problems that arise naturally in a variety of contexts, and spanning the continuum from pure consensus decision making (i.e., standard social choice) to fully personalized recommendation. Our approach applies a form of segmentation to social choice problems-- requiring the selection of diverse options tailored to different agent types--and generalizes certain multiwinner election schemes. We show that standard rank aggregation methods perform poorly, and that optimization in our model is NP-complete; but we develop fast greedy algorithms with some theoretical guarantees. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (133)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Tyler Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Tyler", "Craig Boutilier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boutilier:Craig"], "pages": 7}
