{"title": "CSMA k-SIC - A class of distributed MAC protocols and their performance evaluation.", "fields": ["monte carlo method", "interference", "information theory", "single antenna interference cancellation", "computer network"], "abstract": "The CSMA/CA protocol is based on the \u201cInterference as Noise\u201d (IAN) paradigm i.e. it always gets rid of strong interference near a receiver to ensure quality of reception. However, it is well known from Multi-user Information Theory that treating Interference as Noise is not optimal. This paper proposes a class of protocols that employ the Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) technique in a systematic fashion to move beyond always treating interference as noise. Such protocols allow one to pack more links than the classical CSMA. We describe the protocols along with their signaling mechanism to implement them in a distributed fashion. We then perform Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance and show significant gains over the IAN based CSMA/CA protocol in large random networks.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "infocom", "authors": ["Abishek Sankararaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankararaman:Abishek", "Fran\u00e7ois Baccelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baccelli:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 9}
