MADNESS is a high-level software environment for the solution of integral and differential equations in many dimensions, using adaptive and fast harmonic analysis methods with guaranteed precision. MADNESS uses k-d trees to represent spatial functions and implements operators like addition, multiplication, differentiation, and integration on the numerical representation of functions. The MADNESS runtime system provides global namespace support and a task-based execution model including futures.   MADNESS is currently deployed on massively parallel supercomputers and has enabled many science advances. Due to the highly irregular and statically unpredictable structure of the k-d trees representing the spatial functions encountered in MADNESS applications, only purely runtime approaches to optimization have previously been implemented in the MADNESS framework. This paper describes a layered domain-specific compiler developed to address some performance bottlenecks in MADNESS. The newly developed static compile-time optimizations, in conjunction with the MADNESS runtime support, enable significant performance improvement for the MADNESS framework.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Ohio State University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Samyam Rajbhandari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajbhandari:Samyam", "Jinsung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jinsung", "Sriram Krishnamoorthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamoorthy:Sriram", "Louis-No\u00ebl Pouchet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pouchet:Louis=No=euml=l", "Fabrice Rastello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rastello:Fabrice", "Robert J.
