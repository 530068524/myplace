{"title": "Survivable Distributed Storage with Progressive Decoding.", "fields": ["reed solomon error correction", "computer virus", "distributed data store", "byzantine fault tolerance", "data retrieval"], "abstract": "We propose a storage-optimal and computation efficient primitive to spread information from a single data source to a set of storage nodes, to allow recovery from both crash-stop and Byzantine failures. A progressive data retrieval scheme is employed, which retrieves minimal amount of data from live storage nodes. The scheme adapts the cost of successful data retrieval to the degree of errors in the system. Implementation and evaluation studies demonstrate comparable performance to that of a genie-aid decoding process.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National Chi Nan University", "University of Houston", "University of Houston"], "authors": ["Yunghsiang S.
