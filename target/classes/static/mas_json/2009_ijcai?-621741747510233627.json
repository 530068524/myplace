Our approach generalizes previous work on coupled priors for hybrid generative/discriminative models. Our model is more flexible and natural than previous approaches. Experimental results on several data sets show that our approach also performs better in practice.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "authors": ["Arvind Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Arvind", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
