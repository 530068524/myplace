This allows to address query optimization by mature MILP solver implementations that have evolved over decades and steadily improved their performance. They offer features such as anytime optimization and parallel search that are highly relevant for query optimization.   We present a MILP formulation for searching left-deep query plans. We use sets of binary variables to represent join operands and intermediate results, operator implementation choices or the presence of interesting orders. Linear constraints restrict value assignments to the ones representing valid query plans. We approximate the cost of scan and join operations via linear functions, allowing to increase approximation precision up to arbitrary degrees. We integrated a prototypical implementation of our approach into the Postgres optimizer and compare against the original optimizer and several variants. Our experimental results are encouraging: we are able to optimize queries joining 40 tables within less than one minute of optimization time. Such query sizes are far beyond the capabilities of traditional query optimization algorithms with worst case guarantees on plan quality. Furthermore, as we use an existing solver, our optimizer implementation is small and can be integrated with low overhead.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Cornell University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Immanuel Trummer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trummer:Immanuel", "Christoph Koch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koch_0001:Christoph"], "pages": 16}
