{"title": "Generating Fixes from Object Behavior Anomalies.", "fields": ["test suite", "object oriented modeling", "regression testing", "software bug", "aspectj"], "abstract": "Advances in recent years have made it possible in some cases to locate a bug (the source of a failure) automatically. But debugging is also about correcting bugs. Can tools do this automatically? The results reported in this paper, from the new PACHIKA tool, suggest that such a goal may be reachable. PACHIKA leverages differences in program behavior to generate program fixes directly. It automatically summarizes executions to object behavior models, determines differences between passing and failing runs, generates possible fixes, and assesses them via the regression test suite. Evaluated on the ASPECTJ bug history, PACHIKA generates a valid fix for 3 out of 18 crashing bugs; each fix pinpoints the bug location and passes the ASPECTJ test suite.", "citation": "Citations (136)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Valentin Dallmeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dallmeier:Valentin", "Andreas Zeller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeller:Andreas", "Bertrand Meyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyer_0001:Bertrand"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
