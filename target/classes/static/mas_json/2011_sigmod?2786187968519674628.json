Recent work suggests using causal reasoning to find explanations for the surprising result. In practice, however, one often has multiple queries and/or multiple answers, some of which may be considered correct and others unexpected. In this paper, we focus on determining the causes of a set of unexpected results, possibly conditioned on some prior knowledge of the correctness of another set of results. We call this problem View-Conditioned Causality. We adapt the definitions of causality and responsibility for the case of multiple answers/views and provide a non-trivial algorithm that reduces the problem of finding causes and their responsibility to a satisfiability problem that can be solved with existing tools. We evaluate both the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach on a real dataset of user-generated mobile device tracking data, and demonstrate that it can identify causes of error more effectively than static Boolean influence and alternative notions of causality.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Microsoft", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Alexandra Meliou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meliou:Alexandra", "Wolfgang Gatterbauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gatterbauer:Wolfgang", "Suman Nath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nath:Suman", "Dan Suciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suciu:Dan"], "pages": 12}
