{"title": "MPAnalyzer: a tool for finding unintended inconsistencies in program source code.", "fields": ["source code", "data mining", "computer science", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Unintended inconsistencies are caused by missing a modification task that requires code changes on multiple locations in program source code. In order to identify such inconsistencies efficiently, we proposed a new technique. It firstly learns how code fragments were changed in the past modification tasks, and then, it identifies where inconsistencies exist at the latest version. In this paper, we focus on an aspect of the tool that we developed and shows a case study that we conducted with the tool.
