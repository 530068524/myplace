{"title": "Throttling Poisson Processes.", "fields": ["bandwidth throttling", "poisson distribution", "convex optimization", "rate limiting", "poisson process"], "abstract": "We study a setting in which Poisson processes generate sequences of decision-making events. The optimization goal is allowed to depend on the rate of decision outcomes; the rate may depend on a potentially long backlog of events and decisions. We model the problem as a Poisson process with a throttling policy that enforces a data-dependent rate limit and reduce the learning problem to a convex optimization problem that can be solved efficiently. This problem setting matches applications in which damage caused by an attacker grows as a function of the rate of unsuppressed hostile events. We report on experiments on abuse detection for an email service.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam", "University of Potsdam"], "authors": ["Uwe Dick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dick:Uwe", "Peter Haider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haider:Peter", "Thomas Vanck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanck:Thomas", "Michael Br\u00fcckner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Br=uuml=ckner:Michael", "Tobias Scheffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scheffer:Tobias"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
