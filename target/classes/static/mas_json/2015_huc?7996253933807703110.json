But, the lack of a gold standard is a major hurdle in making clinical use of continuous stress measurements derived from wearable sensors. In this paper, we present a stress model (called  cStress ) that has been carefully developed with attention to every step of computational modeling including data collection, screening, cleaning, filtering, feature computation, normalization, and model training. More importantly, cStress was trained using data collected from a rigorous lab study with 21 participants and validated on two independently collected data sets --- in a lab study on 26 participants and in a week-long field study with 20 participants. In testing, the model obtains a recall of 89% and a false positive rate of 5% on lab data. On field data, the model is able to predict each instantaneous self-report with an accuracy of 72%.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Troy University", "University of Minnesota", "Ohio State University", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Karen Hovsepian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hovsepian:Karen", "Mustafa al'Absi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/al=Absi:Mustafa", "Emre Ertin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ertin:Emre", "Thomas Kamarck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamarck:Thomas", "Motohiro Nakajima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakajima:Motohiro", "Santosh Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Santosh"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
