For example, in health care scenarios or for autonomous configuration of IoT setups this information can be useful. One of the key challenges in localization is to estimate the distance between nodes. Most present indoor localization systems require additional hardware for this estimation which is costly in terms of money and energy consumption. To overcome this disadvantage, we developed a system which is able to perform distance measurements without adding any extra hardware and costs. It is based on phase measurements performed by the IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver chip that is normally solely used to realize communication. In the evaluation we investigate the performance of our system in different real world environments that are typical for IoT and WSN setups.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Braunschweig University of Technology", "Braunschweig University of Technology", "Braunschweig University of Technology", "Braunschweig University of Technology", "Braunschweig University of Technology"], "authors": ["Georg von Zengen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zengen:Georg_von", "Yannic Schr\u00f6der.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schr=ouml=der:Yannic", "Stephan Rottmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rottmann:Stephan", "Felix B\u00fcsching.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=uuml=sching:Felix", "Lars C.
