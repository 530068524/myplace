{"title": "Symbolic Synthesis of Observability Requirements for Diagnosability.", "fields": ["machine learning", "observable", "observability", "model checking", "ranking"], "abstract": "Given a partially observable dynamic system and a diagnoser observing its evolution over time, diagnosability analysis formally verifies (at design time) if the diagnosis system will be able to infer (at runtime) the required information on the hidden part of the dynamic state. Diagnosability directly depends on the availability of observations, and can be guaranteed by different sets of sensors, possibly associated with different costs. In this paper, we tackle the problem of synthesizing observability requirements, i. e. automatically discovering a set of observations that is sufficient to guarantee diagnosability.\n\nWe propose a novel approach with the following characterizing features. First, it fully covers a comprehensive formal framework for diagnosability analysis, and enables ranking configurations of observables in terms of cost, minimality, and diagnosability delay. Second, we propose two complementary algorithms for the synthesis of observables. Third, we describe an efficient implementation that takes full advantage of mature symbolic model checking techniques. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated over a comprehensive suite of benchmarks taken from the aerospace domain.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "fondazione bruno kessler", "fondazione bruno kessler", "Alenia Aeronautica"], "authors": ["Benjamin Bittner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bittner:Benjamin", "Marco Bozzano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bozzano:Marco", "Alessandro Cimatti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cimatti:Alessandro", "Xavier Olive.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olive:Xavier"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
