{"title": "Limitations of Front-To-End Bidirectional Heuristic Search.", "fields": ["incremental heuristic search", "pathfinding", "null move heuristic", "fringe search", "bidirectional search"], "abstract": "We present an intuitive explanation for the limited effectiveness of front-to-end bidirectional heuristic search, supported with extensive evidence from many commonly-studied domains. While previous work has proved the limitations of specific algorithms, we show that any front-to-end bidirectional heuristic search algorithm will likely be dominated by unidirectional heuristic search or bidirectional brute-force search. We also demonstrate a pathological case where bidirectional heuristic search is the dominant algorithm, so a stronger claim cannot be made. Finally, we show that on the four-peg Towers Of Hanoi with arbitrary start and goal states, bidirectional brute-force search outperforms unidirectional heuristic search using pattern-database heuristics.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Los Angeles, CA", "Los Angeles, CA"], "authors": ["Joseph Kelly Barker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barker:Joseph_Kelly", "Richard E.
