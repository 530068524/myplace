This approach supports n-best hypotheses in the dialog manager and keeps track of the dialog state using a discourse interpretation algorithm with the agenda graph and focus stack. Given the agenda graph and n-best hypotheses, the system can predict the next system actions to maximize multi-level score functions. To evaluate the proposed method, a spoken dialog system for a building guidance robot was developed. Preliminary evaluation shows this approach would be effective to improve the robustness of example-based dialog modeling.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Cheongjae Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Cheongjae", "Sangkeun Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Sangkeun", "Gary Geunbae Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Gary_Geunbae"], "pages": 8}
