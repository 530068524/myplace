{"title": "A death in the family: opportunities for designing technologies for the bereaved.", "fields": ["multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "Following the death of a loved one, bereaved family members use technology in several ways to respond to their loss. However, very little is known about how technology intersects with the lives of the bereaved. We present a survey and interview study which examines how the bereaved inherit personal digital devices, use technology to remember the deceased, and reflect on their own digital estates. The study provides one of the first characterizations of technology use by the bereaved, and presents a set of empirically-grounded design opportunities and challenges.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Michael Massimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massimi:Michael", "Ronald M.
