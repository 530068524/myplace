The DISPONTE semantics for probabilistic description logics allows to annotate axioms of a knowledge base with a value that represents their probability. In this paper we discuss approaches for performing inference from probabilistic ontologies following the DISPONTE semantics. We present the algorithm BUNDLE for computing the probability of queries. BUNDLE exploits an underlying Description Logic reasoner, such as Pellet, in order to find explanations for a query. These are then encoded in a Binary Decision Diagram that is used for computing the probability of the query.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Ferrara", "University of Ferrara", "University of Ferrara", "University of Ferrara"], "authors": ["Fabrizio Riguzzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riguzzi:Fabrizio", "Elena Bellodi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellodi:Elena", "Evelina Lamma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lamma:Evelina", "Riccardo Zese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zese:Riccardo"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
