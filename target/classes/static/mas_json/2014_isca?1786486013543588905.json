A request typically traverses the cache hierarchy, level by level, until the data is found, thereby wasting time and energy in each level. In this paper, we present the Direct-to-Data (D2D) cache that locates data across the entire cache hierarchy with a single lookup.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Uppsala University", "Uppsala University"], "authors": ["Andreas Sembrant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sembrant:Andreas", "Erik Hagersten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hagersten:Erik", "David Black-Schaffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Black=Schaffer:David"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
