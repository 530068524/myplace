{"title": "Robust Formulations for Handling Uncertainty in Kernel Matrices.", "fields": ["regular polygon", "convex optimization", "constraint programming", "gaussian", "kernel"], "abstract": "We study the problem of uncertainty in the entries of the Kernel matrix, arising in SVM formulation. Using Chance Constraint Programming and a novel large deviation inequality we derive a formulation which is robust to such noise. The resulting formulation applies when the noise is Gaussian, or has finite support. The formulation in general is non-convex, but in several cases of interest it reduces to a convex program. The problem of uncertainty in kernel matrix is motivated from the real world problem of classifying proteins when the structures are provided with some uncertainty. The formulation derived here naturally incorporates such uncertainty in a principled manner leading to significant improvements over the state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "Yahoo!", "Indian Institute of Science", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sahely Bhadra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhadra:Sahely", "Sourangshu Bhattacharya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhattacharya:Sourangshu", "Chiranjib Bhattacharyya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhattacharyya:Chiranjib", "Aharon Ben-Tal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Tal:Aharon"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
