In this work we prove that existing lower bounds for the round complexity of VSS can be circumvented by introducing a negligible probability of error in the reconstruction phase. Previous results show matching lower and upper bounds of three rounds for VSS, with n = 3t + 1, where the reconstruction of the secrets always succeeds, i.e. with probability 1. In contrast we show that with a negligible probability of error in the reconstruction phase:\n\n1 There exists an efficient 2-round VSS protocol for n = 3t + 1. If we assume that the adversary is non-rushing then we can achieve a 1-round reconstruction phase.\n1 There exists an efficient 1-round VSS for t = 1 and n > 3.\n1 We prove that our results are optimal both in resilience and number of sharing rounds by showing:\n\n1 There does not exist a 2-round WSS (and hence VSS) for n \u2264 3t.\n1 There does not exist a 1-round VSS protocol for t ? 2 and n ? 4.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Madras", "Indian Institute of Technology Madras", "IBM", "Indian Institute of Technology Madras"], "authors": ["Arpita Patra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patra:Arpita", "Ashish Choudhary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudhary:Ashish", "Tal Rabin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabin:Tal", "C.
