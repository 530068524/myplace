{"title": "Rigid fluid.", "fields": ["rendering", "mathematical optimization", "phase change", "particle", "solver"], "abstract": "We present a framework for modeling solid-fluid phase change. Our framework is physically-motivated, with geometric constraints applied to define rigid dynamics using shape matching. In each simulation step, particle positions are updated using an extended SPH solver where they are treated as fluid. Then a geometric constraint is computed based on current particle configuration, which consists of an optimal translation and an optimal rotation. Our approach differs from methods such as [Carlson et al. 2004] in that we solve rigid dynamics by using a stable geometric constraint [Muller et al. 2005] embedded in a fluid simulator.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County"], "conf": "siggraph", "authors": ["Yu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yu", "Marc Olano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olano:Marc"], "pages": 1}
