In Misual Project, the research is done to provide people with a way to learn/know music other than by listening to it. This paper focuses on the speed feeling of music, since it is an important musical characteristic for listeners. Although tempo itself is an important indicator of the speed of music, we found that the number of notes per time unit and rhythms (combination of regular and dotted notes) are also important. How and how much these factors contribute to the speed feeling is investigated in listening tests with simple tunes. The factors are visualized so that people can intuitively imagine how fast a tune is. A selection of famous tunes is visualized and the advantage of music visualization is discussed. The visualization allows us to look at a tune as a whole and to compare tunes.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "AGH University of Science and Technology", "NTT Communicati ...
