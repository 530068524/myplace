Most current approaches use meta-model-driven transformation specification via coding in textual scripting languages. This paper demonstrates a novel approach and tool support that instead provides for specification of correspondences between models using concrete visualisations of source and target models, and generates transformation scripts from these by-example model correspondence specifications.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "University of Stuttgart"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Iman Avazpour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avazpour:Iman", "John Grundy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grundy_0001:John", "Lars Grunske.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grunske:Lars"], "pages": 4}
