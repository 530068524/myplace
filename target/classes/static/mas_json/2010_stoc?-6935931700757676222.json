We prove that the intersection of two halfspaces on {0,1} n  has threshold degree Omega(n), which matches the trivial upper bound and completely answers a question due to Klivans (2002). The best previous lower bound was Omega(sqrt n). Our result shows that the intersection of two halfspaces on {0,1} n  only admits a trivial 2 \u0398(n) -time learning algorithm based on sign-representation by polynomials, unlike the advances achieved in PAC learning DNF formulas and read-once Boolean formulas. The proof introduces a new technique of independent interest, based on Fourier analysis and matrix theory.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Alexander A.
