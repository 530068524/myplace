More specifically, our work focuses on recommending query topics to users. We do this by mining the search query logs to detect trending local topics. For a set of queries we compute their counts and what we call buzz scores, which is a metric for detecting trending behavior. We also compute the entropy of the geographic distribution of the queries as means of detecting their location affinity. We cluster the queries into trending topics and assign the topics to their corresponding location. Human editors then select a subset of these local topics and enter them into a recommendation system. In turn the recommendation system optimizes a pool of trending local and global topics by exploiting user feedback. We present some editorial evaluation of the technique and results of a live experiment. Inclusion of local topics in selected locations into the global pool of topics resulted in more than 6% relative increase in user engagement with the recommendation system compared to using the global topics exclusively.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Google"], "authors": ["Ziad Al Bawab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bawab:Ziad_Al", "George H.
