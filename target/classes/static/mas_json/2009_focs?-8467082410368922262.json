The same construction fails, however, under a CCA2 attack. In fact, since the notion of CCA2 security was introduced by Rackoff and Simon~\\cite{RackoffSi92}, it has been an open question to determine whether single bit CCA2 secure encryption implies the existence of many-bit CCA2 security. We positively resolve this long-standing question and establish that bit encryption is complete for CPA, CCA1, and CCA2 notions. Our construction is black-box, and thus requires novel techniques to avoid known impossibility results concerning trapdoor predicates~\\cite{GMR}. To the best of our knowledge, our work is also the first example of a non-shielding reduction (introduced in~\\cite{GMM07}) in the standard (i.e., not random-oracle) model.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Steven Myers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Myers:Steven", "Abhi Shelat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shelat:Abhi"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
