In particular, we provide a new method for determining whether a propositional formula is a tautology or a contradiction. This method can be automatized by defining a term rewriting system that enjoys confluence and strong normalization. This also suggests an original notion of logical gate and circuit, where propositional variables becomes logical gates and logical operations are implemented by substitution. Concerning formulas with quantifiers, we present a simple algorithm based on factor varieties for reducing first-order classical logic to equational logic. We achieve a completeness result for first-order classical logic without requiring any additional structure.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ca' Foscari University of Venice", "University of Paris", "Ca' Foscari University of Venice"], "authors": ["Antonino Salibra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salibra:Antonino", "Giulio Manzonetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manzonetto:Giulio", "Giordano Favro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Favro:Giordano"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
