{"title": "Resolving Entity Morphs in Censored Data.", "fields": ["data mining", "exploit", "machine learning", "the internet", "censoring"], "abstract": "In some societies, internet users have to create information morphs (e.g. \u201cPeace West King\u201d to refer to \u201cBo Xilai\u201d) to avoid active censorship or achieve other communication goals. In this paper we aim to solve a new problem of resolving entity morphs to their real targets. We exploit temporal constraints to collect crosssource comparable corpora relevant to any given morph query and identify target candidates. Then we propose various novel similarity measurements including surface features, meta-path based semantic features and social correlation features and combine them in a learning-to-rank framework. Experimental results on Chinese Sina Weibo data demonstrate that our approach is promising and significantly outperforms baseline methods 1 .", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["City University of New York", "IBM", "City University of New York", "City University of New York", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hongzhao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Hongzhao", "Zhen Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Zhen", "Dian Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Dian", "Heng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Heng", "Yizhou Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yizhou", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei", "He Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:He"], "pages": 11}
