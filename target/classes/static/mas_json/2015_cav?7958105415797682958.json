{"title": "Norn: An SMT Solver for String Constraints.", "fields": ["satisfiability modulo theories", "rule of inference", "regular expression", "string", "solver"], "abstract": "We present version 1.0 of the Norn SMT solver for string constraints. Norn is a solver for an expressive constraint language, including word equations, length constraints, and regular membership queries. As a feature distinguishing Norn from other SMT solvers, Norn is a decision procedure under the assumption of a set of acyclicity conditions on word equations, without any restrictions on the use of regular membership.\nOpen image in new window", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Uppsala University", "Academia Sinica", "Brno University of Technology", "Link\u00f6ping University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Parosh Aziz Abdulla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdulla:Parosh_Aziz", "Mohamed Faouzi Atig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atig:Mohamed_Faouzi", "Yu-Fang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yu=Fang", "Luk\u00e1s Hol\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hol=iacute=k:Luk=aacute=s", "Ahmed Rezine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rezine:Ahmed", "Philipp R\u00fcmmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=uuml=mmer:Philipp", "Jari Stenman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stenman:Jari"], "pages": 8}
