This wireless transmission scheme brings new challenges in the design of MAC layer algorithms that aim to reap its full benefit. First, the MAC layer rate region of the cut-through enabled network is directly a function of the routing decision, leading to a strong coupling between routing and scheduling. Second, it is unclear how to dynamically form/change cut-through routes based on the traffic rates and patterns. In this work, we introduce a novel method to characterize the interference relationship between links in the network with cut-through transmission, which decouples the routing decision with the scheduling decision and enables a seamless adaptation of traditional half-duplex routing/scheduling algorithm into wireless networks with full-duplex cut-through capabilities. Based on this interference model, a queue-length based CSMA-type scheduling algorithm is proposed, which both leverages the flexibility of full-duplex cut-through transmission and permits distributed implementation.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Yang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0010:Yang", "Ness B.
