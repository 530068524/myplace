However, extending the idea to end-to-end video dehazing has not been explored yet. In this paper, we propose an End-to-End Video Dehazing Network (EVD-Net), to exploit the temporal consistency between consecutive video frames. A thorough study has been conducted over a number of structure options, to identify the best temporal fusion strategy. Furthermore, we build an End-to-End United Video Dehazing and Detection Network(EVDD-Net), which concatenates and jointly trains EVD-Net with a video object detection model. The resulting augmented end-to-end pipeline has demonstrated much more stable and accurate detection results in hazy video.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Texas A&M University", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Boyi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Boyi", "Xiulian Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Xiulian", "Zhangyang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhangyang", "Jizheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jizheng", "Dan Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Dan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
