In this paper, we address the fundamental issue of quantifying to which extent secret sharing schemes, combined with nodes mobility, can help in assuring data availability and confidentiality. We provide accurate analytical results binding the fraction of the network accessed by the sink and the adversary to the amount of information they can successfully recover. Extensive simulations support our findings.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Dept. of Math., ... re, Rome, Italy", "Dept. of Math., ... re, Rome, Italy"], "authors": ["Roberto Di Pietro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietro:Roberto_Di", "Stefano Guarino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guarino:Stefano"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
