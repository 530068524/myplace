{"title": "STRIVE: Stress Resilience in Virtual Environments.", "fields": ["exposure therapy", "psychoeducation", "psychological resilience", "allostatic load", "experiential learning"], "abstract": "The Stress Resilience In Virtual Environments (STRIVE) project aims to create a set of combat simulations (adapted from existing Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan exposure therapy system) that are part of a multi-episode narrative experience. Users can be immersed within challenging combat contexts and interact with virtual characters within these episodes as part of an experiential learning approach. Such approaches, often referred to as Stress Inoculation Training, have been found to reduce the neuroendocrine response, increase coping competence and reduce cortisol response. STRIVE is currently developing three combat modules with a narrative arc that includes increasingly intense combat situations, relational development, stress and loss, and emotional trauma. The goal is to raise the service member's threshold for the stress of combat.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["J.
