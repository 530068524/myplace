Previous work has raised awareness of the diversity between individuals' perceptions. In this paper it will furthermore become apparent that such diversity can also exist within a single individual, in the sense that different attribute judgments from a subject may reveal different, complementary, views. A Multi-Dimensional Scaling approach that accounts for the diverse views on a set of stimuli is proposed and its added value is illustrated using published data. We will illustrate that the averaging analysis provides insight to only 1/6th of the total number of attributes in the example dataset. The proposed approach accounts for more than double the information obtained from the average model, and provides richer and semantically diverse views on the set of stimuli.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "University of Siegen"], "authors": ["Evangelos Karapanos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karapanos:Evangelos", "Jean-Bernard Martens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martens:Jean=Bernard", "Marc Hassenzahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassenzahl:Marc"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
