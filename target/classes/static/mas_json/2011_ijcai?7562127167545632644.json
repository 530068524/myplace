The central problem is to tell which differences between instances of activities are unimportant and may be safely ignored for the purpose of learning generalized representations of activities. We develop a novel way to find the \"essential parts\" of activities by a greedy kind of multiple sequence alignment, and a method to transform the resulting alignments into Finite State Machine that will accept novel instances of activities with high accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "University of Arizona"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Wesley Kerr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kerr:Wesley", "Anh Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran:Anh", "Paul R.
