We describe an extensive experiment we conducted within our organization comparing social network information gathered from various intranet public sources with social network information gathered from a private source - the organizational email system. We also report the conclusions of a series of interviews we conducted based on our experiment. The results shed light on the richness of public social network information, its characteristics, and added value over email network information.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Ido Guy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guy:Ido", "Michal Jacovi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacovi:Michal", "Noga Meshulam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meshulam:Noga", "Inbal Ronen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ronen:Inbal", "Elad Shahar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shahar:Elad"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
