{"title": "Using Deep Morphology to Improve Automatic Error Detection in Arabic Handwriting Recognition.", "fields": ["lemma", "intelligent character recognition", "handwriting recognition", "arabic"], "abstract": "Arabic handwriting recognition (HR) is a challenging problem due to Arabic's connected letter forms, consonantal diacritics and rich morphology. In this paper we isolate the task of identification of erroneous words in HR from the task of producing corrections for these words. We consider a variety of linguistic (morphological and syntactic) and non-linguistic features to automatically identify these errors. Our best approach achieves a roughly ~15% absolute increase in F-score over a simple but reasonable baseline. A detailed error analysis shows that linguistic features, such as lemma (i.e., citation form) models, help improve HR-error detection precisely where we expect them to: semantically incoherent error words.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Nizar Habash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habash:Nizar", "Ryan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth:Ryan"], "pages": 10}
