Two properties are investigated here \u2014 secrecy, which asks if no adversary interacting with a protocol P can determine a secret sec with probability > 1 \u2212 p; and indistinguishability, which asks if the probability observing any sequence 0\u0304 in P 1  is the same as that of observing 0\u0304 in P 2 , under the same adversary. Both secrecy and indistinguishability are known to be coNP-complete for non-randomized protocols. In contrast, we show that, for randomized protocols, secrecy and indistinguishability are both decidable in coNEXPTIME. We also prove a matching lower bound for the secrecy problem by reducing the non-satisfiability problem of monadic first order logic without equality.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Missouri", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Rohit Chadha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chadha:Rohit", "A.
