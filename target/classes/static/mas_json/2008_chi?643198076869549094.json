We investigate pointing within this peephole metaphor, where the targets may not be initially visible on the display, but are dynamically revealed by moving the display. We develop and experimentally validate a quantitative model for peephole pointing. Our results indicate that the model accurately accounts for peephole pointing for a variety of display sizes, both with and without users' having prior knowledge of the target location.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Xiang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xiang", "Jacky Jie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jacky_Jie", "Ravin Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Ravin"], "pages": 10}
