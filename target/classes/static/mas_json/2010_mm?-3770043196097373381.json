The approach is based on purely nonverbal vocal behavioral cues, including who talks when and how much (turn-taking behavior), and statistical properties of pitch, formants, energy and speaking rate (prosodic behavior). The experiments have been performed over a corpus of around 50 hours of broadcast material and the accuracy, percentage of time correctly labeled in terms of role, is up to 89%. Both turn-taking and prosodic behavior lead to satisfactory results. Furthermore, on one database, their combination leads to a statistically significant improvement.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Twente", "Idiap Research Institute", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "Idiap Research Institute"], "authors": ["Hugues Salamin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salamin:Hugues", "Alessandro Vinciarelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vinciarelli:Alessandro", "Khiet Truong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Truong:Khiet", "Gelareh Mohammadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohammadi:Gelareh"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
