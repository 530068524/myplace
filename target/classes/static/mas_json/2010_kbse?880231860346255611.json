{"title": "PLASMA: a plan-based layered architecture for software model-driven adaptation.", "fields": ["space based architecture", "software design description", "software architecture description", "database centric architecture", "functional software architecture"], "abstract": "Modern software-intensive systems are expected to adapt, often while the system is executing, to changing requirements, failures, and new operational contexts. This paper describes an approach to dynamic system adaptation that utilizes plan-based and architecture-based mechanisms. Our approach utilizes an architecture description language (ADL) and a planning-as-model-checking technology to enable dynamic replanning. The ability to automatically generate adaptation plans based solely on ADL models and an application problem description simplifies the specification and use of adaptation mechanisms for system architects. The approach uses a three-layer architecture that, while similar to previous work, provides several significant improvements. We apply our approach within the context of a mobile robotics case study.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Hossein Tajalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tajalli:Hossein", "Joshua Garcia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia:Joshua", "George Edwards.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edwards:George", "Nenad Medvidovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medvidovic:Nenad"], "pages": 10}
