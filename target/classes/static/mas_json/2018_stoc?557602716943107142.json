{"title": "Towards a proof of the 2-to-1 games conjecture?", "fields": ["conjecture", "polynomial time reduction", "completeness", "beal s conjecture", "graph", "combinatorics", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "vertex cover"], "abstract": "We present a polynomial time reduction from gap-3LIN to label cover with 2-to-1 constraints. In the \u201cyes\u201d case the fraction of satisfied constraints is at least 1 \u2212e, and in the \u201cno\u201d case we show that this fraction is at most e, assuming a certain (new) combinatorial hypothesis on the Grassmann graph. In other words, we describe a combinatorial hypothesis that implies the 2-to-1 conjecture with imperfect completeness. The companion submitted paper [Dinur, Khot, Kindler, Minzer and Safra, STOC 2018] makes some progress towards proving this hypothesis.    Our work builds on earlier work by a subset of the authors [Khot, Minzer and Safra, STOC 2017] where a slightly different hypothesis was used to obtain hardness of approximating vertex cover to within factor of \u221a2\u2212e.    The most important implication of this work is (assuming the hypothesis) an  NP-hardness gap of  1/2\u2212e  vs.  e  for unique games . In addition, we derive optimal NP-hardness for approximating the max-cut-gain problem, NP-hardness of coloring an almost 4-colorable graph with any constant number of colors, and the same \u221a2\u2212e NP-hardness for approximate vertex cover that was already obtained based on a slightly different hypothesis.    Recent progress towards proving our hypothesis [Barak, Kothari and Steurer, ECCC TR18-077], [Dinur, Khot, Kindler, Minzer and Safra, STOC 2018] directly implies some new  unconditional  NP-hardness results. These include new points of NP-hardness for unique games and for 2-to-1 and 2-to-2 games. More recently, the full version of our hypothesis was proven [Khot, Minzer and Safra, ECCC TR18-006].", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "New York University", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Irit Dinur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinur:Irit", "Subhash Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Subhash", "Guy Kindler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kindler:Guy", "Dor Minzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minzer:Dor", "Muli Safra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Safra:Muli"], "pages": 14}
