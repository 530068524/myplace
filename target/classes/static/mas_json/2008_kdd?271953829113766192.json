{"title": "An inductive database prototype based on virtual mining views.", "fields": ["database design", "decision tree learning", "data stream mining", "concept mining", "view"], "abstract": "We present a prototype of an inductive database. Our system enables the user to query not only the data stored in the database but also generalizations (e.g. rules or trees) over these data through the use of virtual mining views. The mining views are relational tables that virtually contain the complete output of data mining algorithms executed over a given dataset. The prototype implemented into PostgreSQL currently integrates frequent itemset, association rule and decision tree mining. We illustrate the interactive and iterative capabilities of our system with a description of a complete data mining scenario.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of Antwerp", "University of Antwerp"], "authors": ["Hendrik Blockeel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blockeel:Hendrik", "Toon Calders.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calders:Toon", "\u00c9lisa Fromont.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fromont:=Eacute=lisa", "Bart Goethals.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goethals:Bart", "Adriana Prado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prado:Adriana", "C\u00e9line Robardet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robardet:C=eacute=line"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
