In this demo, we present DynaCet - a domain independent system that provides effective minimum-effort based dynamic faceted search solutions over enterprise databases. At every step, Dynacet suggests facets depending on the user response in the previous step. Facets are selected based on their ability to rapidly drill down to the most promising tuples, as well as on the ability of the user to provide desired values for them. The benefits provided include faster access to information stored in databases while taking into consideration the variance in user knowledge and preferences.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington", "IBM", "University of Texas at Arlington", "IBM"], "authors": ["Senjuti Basu Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Senjuti_Basu", "Haidong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haidong", "Ullas Nambiar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nambiar:Ullas", "Gautam Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das_0001:Gautam", "Mukesh K.
