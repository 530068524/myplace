Based on those, we propose a variation of the classical nested depth-first search (ndfs) algorithm that exploits subsumption. In addition, we extend the multi-core cndfs algorithm with subsumption, providing the first parallel LTL model checking algorithm for timed automata.\n\nThe algorithms are implemented in LTSmin, and experimental evaluations show the effectiveness and scalability of both contributions: subsumption halves the number of states in the real-world FDDI case study, and the multi-core algorithm yields speedups of up to 40 using 48 cores.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Twente", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "University of Twente"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Alfons Laarman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laarman:Alfons", "Mads Chr.
