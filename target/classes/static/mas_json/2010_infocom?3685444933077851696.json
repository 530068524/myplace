While isolated caches have been studied in-depth, multi-cache systems are not well understood, especially in networks with arbitrary topologies. In order to gain insight into and manage these systems, a low-complexity algorithm for approximating their behavior is required. We propose a new algorithm, termed a-Net, that approximates the behavior of multi-cache networks by leveraging existing approximation algorithms for isolated LRU caches. We demonstrate the utility of a-Net using both per- cache and network-wide performance measures. We also perform factor analysis of the approximation error to identify system parameters that determine the precision of a-Net.", "citation": "Citations (202)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Elisha J.
