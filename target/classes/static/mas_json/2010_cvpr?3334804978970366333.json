{"title": "Dynamical binary latent variable models for 3D human pose tracking.", "fields": ["latent variable model", "boltzmann machine", "pose", "probabilistic logic", "latent variable"], "abstract": "We introduce a new class of probabilistic latent variable model called the Implicit Mixture of Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (imCRBM) for use in human pose tracking. Key properties of the imCRBM are as follows: (1) learning is linear in the number of training exemplars so it can be learned from large datasets; (2) it learns coherent models of multiple activities; (3) it automatically discovers atomic \u201cmovemes\u201d and (4) it can infer transitions between activities, even when such transitions are not present in the training set. We describe the model and how it is learned and we demonstrate its use in the context of Bayesian filtering for multi-view and monocular pose tracking. The model handles difficult scenarios including multiple activities and transitions among activities. We report state-of-the-art results on the HumanEva dataset.", "citation": "Citations (119)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["New York University", "Disney Research", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Graham W.
