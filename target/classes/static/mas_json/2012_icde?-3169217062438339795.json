{"title": "Efficient Top-k Keyword Search in Graphs with Polynomial Delay.", "fields": ["approximation theory", "ranking", "tree", "graph", "approximation algorithm"], "abstract": "A system for efficient keyword search in graphs is demonstrated. The system has two components, a search through only the nodes containing the input keywords for a set of nodes that are close to each other and together cover the input keywords and an exploration for finding how these nodes are related to each other. The system generates all or top-$k$ answers in polynomial delay. Answers are presented to the user according to a ranking criterion so that the answers with nodes closer to each other are presented before the ones with nodes farther away from each other. In addition, the set of answers produced by our system is duplication free. The system uses two methods for presenting the final answer to the user. The presentation methods reveal relationships among the nodes in an answer through a tree or a multi-center graph. We will show that each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. The system is demonstrated using two challenging datasets, very large DBLP and highly cyclic Mondial. Challenges and difficulties in implementing an efficient keyword search system are also demonstrated.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["York University", "York University"], "authors": ["Mehdi Kargar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kargar:Mehdi", "Aijun An.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/An:Aijun"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
