{"title": "A Semi-Supervised Learning Approach to Why-Question Answering.", "fields": ["overfitting", "semi supervised learning", "source text", "question answering", "training set"], "abstract": "We propose a semi-supervised learning method for improving why-question answering (why-QA). The key of our method is to generate training data (question-answer pairs) from causal relations in texts such as \"[Tsunamis are generated]effect because [the ocean's water mass is displaced by an earthquake]cause.\" A naive method for the generation would be to make a question-answer pair by simply converting the effect part of the causal relations into a why-question, like \"Why are tsunamis generated?\" from the above example, and using the source text of the causal relations as an answer. However, in our preliminary experiments, this naive method actually failed to improve the why-QA performance. The main reason was that the machine-generated questions were often incomprehensible like \"Why does (it) happen?\", and that the system suffered from overfitting to the results of our automatic causality recognizer. Hence, we developed a novel method that effectively filters out incomprehensible questions and retrieves from texts answers that are likely to be paraphrases of a given causal relation. Through a series of experiments, we showed that our approach significantly improved the precision of the top answer by 8% over the current state-of-the-art system for Japanese why-QA.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"], "authors": ["Jong-Hoon Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Jong=Hoon", "Kentaro Torisawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torisawa:Kentaro", "Chikara Hashimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hashimoto:Chikara", "Ryu Iida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iida:Ryu", "Masahiro Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Masahiro", "Julien Kloetzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kloetzer:Julien"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
