However, current methods either are restricted to problems with factored value functions, or provide solutions without any guarantees on quality. Methods in the former category typically build on heuristic search using upper bounds on the value function. Unfortunately, no techniques exist to compute such upper bounds for problems with non-factored value functions, which would additionally allow for meaningful benchmarking of methods of the latter category. To mitigate this problem, this paper introduces a family of influence-optimistic upper bounds for factored Dec-POMDPs without factored value functions. We demonstrate how we can achieve firm quality guarantees for problems with hundreds of agents.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "Delft University of Technology", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Frans Adriaan Oliehoek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oliehoek:Frans_Adriaan", "Matthijs T.
