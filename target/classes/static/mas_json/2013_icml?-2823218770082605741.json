We generalize Localized Multiple Kernel Learning so as to learn a tree-based primal feature embedding which is high dimensional and sparse. Primal based classification decouples prediction costs from the number of support vectors and our tree-structured features efficiently encode non-linearities while speeding up prediction exponentially over the state-of-the-art. We develop routines for optimizing over the space of tree-structured features and efficiently scale to problems with more than half a million training points. Experiments on benchmark data sets reveal that our formulation can reduce prediction costs by more than three orders of magnitude in some cases with a moderate sacrifice in classification accuracy as compared to RBF-SVMs. Furthermore, our formulation leads to better classification accuracies over leading methods.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Cijo Jose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jose:Cijo", "Prasoon Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Prasoon", "Parv Aggrwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aggrwal:Parv", "Manik Varma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varma:Manik"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
