{"title": "Program extrapolation with jennisys.", "fields": ["software development", "satisfiability modulo theories", "executable", "program synthesis", "recursion"], "abstract": "The desired behavior of a program can be described using an abstract model. Compiling such a model into executable code requires advanced compilation techniques known as synthesis. This paper presents an object-based language, called Jennisys, where programming is done by introducing an abstract model, defining a concrete data representation for the model, and then being aided by automatic synthesis to produce executable code. The paper also presents a synthesis technique for the language. The technique is built on an automatic program verifier that, via an underlying SMT solver, is capable of providing concrete models to failed verifications. The technique proceeds by obtaining sample input/output values from concrete models and then extrapolating programs from the sample points. The synthesis aims to produce code with assignments, branching structure, and possibly recursive calls. It is the first to synthesize code that creates and uses objects in dynamic data structures or aggregate objects. A prototype of the language and synthesis technique has been implemented.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["K.
