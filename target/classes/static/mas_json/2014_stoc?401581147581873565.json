In a seminal 1969 monograph, Minsky and Papert constructed a polynomial-size constant-depth {\u2227, \u2228)-circuit in  n  variables with threshold degree  \u03a9 ( n  1/3 ). This bound underlies some of today's strongest results on constant-depth circuits. It has been an open problem (O'Donnell and Servedio, STOC 2003) to improve Minsky and Papert's bound to  n   \u03a9 (1)+1/3 .   We give a detailed solution to this problem. For any fixed  k  \u2265 1, we construct an {\u2227, \u2228)-formula of size  n  and depth  k  with threshold degree \u03a9(n k-1/2k-1). This lower bound nearly matches a known  O ( \u221an ) bound for arbitrary formulas, and is exactly tight for regular formulas. Our result proves a conjecture due to O'Donnell and Servedio (STOC 2003) and a different conjecture due to Bun and Thaler (2013).
