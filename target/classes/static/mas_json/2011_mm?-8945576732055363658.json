The whole system has two modules, processing and playing. In the processing part, we present a video time density function (VTDF) to describe the temporal dynamics of video data first. A VTDF-based temporal quantization method is then developed to find the best quanta and partition in the time domain. The optimal quanta are used to extract key frames. The optimal number of key frames is determined by a temporal mean square error (TMSE)-based criterion. In the playing module, we combine the key frame sequence and a set of parameters together and feed them into a triangle-based transition function to generate the sampled frames in a non-uniform way. A built video player will play all sampled frames in its intelligent fast-forward mode for a given fast-forward speed factor. The implementation of video player demonstrates the feasibility of proposed method in practice.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Ryerson University", "Ryerson University"], "authors": ["Junfeng Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Junfeng", "Xiao-Ping Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiao=Ping"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
