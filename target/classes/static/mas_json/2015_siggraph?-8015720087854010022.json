It is most frequently seen from aircraft when the observer is directly between the sun and the clouds. Glories are also sometimes seen by skydivers looking down through thin cloud layers. They are always centered around the shadow of the observer's head (or camera).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County"], "authors": ["Ari Rapkin Blenkhorn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blenkhorn:Ari_Rapkin"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
