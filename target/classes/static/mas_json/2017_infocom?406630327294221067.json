The side effect of bundling is the increased delay experienced by mobile applications. While several bundling algorithms have been proposed in the literature, a general and systematic solution to balance the energy-delay tradeoff is missing. In this paper, we formulate bundling as a cost minimization problem, in which the tradeoff between energy and delay is captured by a cost function. We then propose an online algorithm for minimizing the bundling cost and show that the algorithm is 4-competitive with respect to the optimal offline algorithm that knows the entire sequence of data transfer requests a priori. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and the accuracy of our results in a range of realistic scenarios using both model-driven simulations and real experiments on a smartphone. Our results show that depending on the delay tolerance level of a user, energy savings ranging from zero (delay intolerant) to about 100% (delay tolerant) can be achieved using our algorithm.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Ali Sehati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sehati:Ali", "Majid Ghaderi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghaderi:Majid"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
