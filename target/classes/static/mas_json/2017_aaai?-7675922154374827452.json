{"title": "SnapNETS: Automatic Segmentation of Network Sequences with Node Labels.", "fields": ["feature engineering", "graph", "snapshot", "market segmentation", "scalability"], "abstract": "Given a sequence of snapshots of flu propagating over a population network,  can we find a segmentation when the patterns of the disease spread change,  possibly due to interventions? In this paper, we study the problem of segmenting  graph sequences with labeled nodes. Memes on the Twitter network, diseases over  a contact network, movie-cascades over a social network, etc. are all graph  sequences with labeled nodes. Most related work is on plain graphs (and hence ignore the label dynamics)  or fix parameters or require much feature engineering. Instead, we propose SnapNETS, to automatically find segmentations of such graph sequences,  with different characteristics of nodes of each label in adjacent segments.  It satisfies all the desired properties (being parameter-free, comprehensive and  scalable) by leveraging a principled, multi-level, flexible framework which  maps  the problem to a path optimization problem over a weighted DAG. Extensive experiments on several diverse real datasets show that it finds  cut points matching ground-truth or meaningful external signals outperforming  non-trivial baselines.  We also show that SnapNETS scales near-linearly with  the size of the input.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Sorour E.
