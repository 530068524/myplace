The goal is to compute a maximum profit set of tasks such that, for each edge $e$ of $P$, the total demand of selected tasks that use $e$ does not exceed the capacity of $e$. This is a well-studied problem that has been described under alternative names, such as resource allocation, bandwidth allocation, resource constrained scheduling, temporal knapsack, and interval packing. We present a polynomial time constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem. This improves on the previous best known approximation ratio of $O(\\log n)$. The approximation ratio of our algorithm is $7+\\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon>0$. We introduce several novel algorithmic techniques, which might be of independent interest: a framework which reduces the problem to instances with a bounded range of capacities, and a new geometrically inspired dynamic program which solv...", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Humboldt State University", "External Organizations", "External Organizations", "Inst. of Math., ...
