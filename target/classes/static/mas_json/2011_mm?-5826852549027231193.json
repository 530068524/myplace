{"title": "\"WaterTouch\": an aquatic interactive multimedia sensory table based on total internal reflection in water.", "fields": ["interactive media", "underwater", "tangible user interface", "ebb and flow", "organic user interface"], "abstract": "We propose a water-based multitouch multimedia user-interface based on total-internal reflection as viewed by an underwater camera. The underwater camera is arranged so that nothing above the water surface is visible until a user touches the water, at which time anything that penetrates the water's surface becomes clearly visible. Our contribution is twofold: (1) computer vision using underwater cameras aided by total internal reflection; (2) hyperacoustic signal processing (frequency shifting) to capture the natural, acoustically-originating sounds of water rather than using synthetic sounds.   Using water itself as a touch screen creates a fun and playful user interface medium that captures the fluidity of the water's ebb and flow. In one application, a musical instrument is created in which acoustic disturbances in the water (received by underwater microphones or hydrophones) are frequency-shifted to musical notes corresponding to the location in which the water is touched, as determined by the underwater computer vision system.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Steve Mann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mann:Steve", "Ryan E.
