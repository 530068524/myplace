This study moves beyond technology demonstrations, in aiming to better understand  how  and  why  different types of Lifelogs aid memory. Previous work has demonstrated that Lifelogs can aid recall, but that they do many other things too. They can help us look back at the past in new ways, or to reconstruct what we did in our lives, even if we don't recall exact details. Here we extend the notion of Lifelogging to include  locational  information. We augment streams of Lifelog images with geographic data to examine how different types of data (visual or locational) might affect memory. Our results show that visual cues promote detailed memories (akin to recollection). In contrast locational information supports inferential processes -- allowing participants to reconstruct habits in their behaviour.", "citation": "Citations (140)", "departments": ["University of Sheffield", "Microsoft", "IBM", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Vaiva Kalnikait\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalnikait=eacute=:Vaiva", "Abigail Sellen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sellen:Abigail", "Steve Whittaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittaker:Steve", "David S.
