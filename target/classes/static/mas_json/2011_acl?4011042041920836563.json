{"title": "Disentangling Chat with Local Coherence Models.", "fields": ["machine learning", "coherence", "topic model", "generality", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We evaluate several popular models of local discourse coherence for domain and task generality by applying them to chat disentanglement. Using experiments on synthetic multiparty conversations, we show that most models transfer well from text to dialogue. Coherence models improve results overall when good parses and topic models are available, and on a constrained task for real chat data.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Brown University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Micha Elsner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elsner:Micha", "Eugene Charniak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charniak:Eugene"], "pages": 11}
