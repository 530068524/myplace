The specification is given in linear-temporal logic. Like in previous approaches, we aim for a repaired program that satisfies the specification and is syntactically close to the faulty program. The novelty of our approach is that it produces a program that is also semantically close to the original program by enforcing that a subset of the original traces is preserved. Intuitively, the faulty program is considered to be a part of the specification, which enables us to synthesize meaningful repairs, even for incomplete specifications.\n\nOur approach is based on synthesizing a program with a set of behaviors that stay within a lower and an upper bound. We provide an algorithm to decide if a program is repairable with respect to our new notion, and synthesize a repair if one exists. We analyze several ways to choose the set of traces to leave intact and show the boundaries they impose on repairability. We have evaluated the approach on several examples.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Google", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Christian von Essen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Essen:Christian_von", "Barbara Jobstmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jobstmann:Barbara"], "pages": 16}
