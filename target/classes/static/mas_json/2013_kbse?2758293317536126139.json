In this paper, we define a logical foundation for rule-based specifications that has enough expressivity and operational behavior to be practically useful and at the same time enables decidability of important overall properties such as consistency or cycle-freeness. Our logic supports rule-based interactive user transitions as well as the definition of a domain theory via rule transitions. As a running example, we model DOPLER, a rule-based configuration system currently in use at Siemens.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Siemens", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Logic4Business  ... r\u00fccken, Germany"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Deepak Dhungana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhungana:Deepak", "Ching Hoo Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Ching_Hoo", "Christoph Weidenbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weidenbach:Christoph", "Patrick Wischnewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wischnewski:Patrick"], "pages": 11}
