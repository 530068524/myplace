In contrast to current 802.11 systems that use fixed width channels, the proposed system, FLUID, configures all access points and their clients using flexible channels. We show that a key challenge in designing such a system stems from managing the effects of interference due to multiple transmitters employing variable channel widths, in a network-wide setting. We implemented FLUID in an enterprise-like setup using a 50 node testbed (with off-the shelf wireless cards) and we show that FLUID improves the average throughput by 59% across all PHY rates, compared to existing fixed-width approaches.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Microsoft", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Shravan K.
