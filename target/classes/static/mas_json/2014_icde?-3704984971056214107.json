Optimizers are inherently difficult to build and maintain, and yet there exists no software engineering tools to facilitate their development. In this paper, we introduce a [Devel]opment Environment for Query [Op]timizers (Devel-Op) designed to facilitate the rapid prototyping, profiling and benchmarking of optimizers. Our current version of the tool permits declarative specification and generation of two key optimizer components (the logical plan enumerator and physical plan generator) as well as debugging and visualization tools for profiling generated components.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Brandeis University", "Brandeis University", "Brandeis University"], "authors": ["Zhibo Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Zhibo", "Mitch Cherniack.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cherniack:Mitch", "Olga Papaemmanouil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papaemmanouil:Olga"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
