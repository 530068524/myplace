{"title": "Mining significant graph patterns by leap search.", "fields": ["exploit", "structural similarity", "speedup", "graph database", "graph kernel"], "abstract": "With ever-increasing amounts of graph data from disparate sources, there has been a strong need for exploiting significant graph patterns with user-specified objective functions. Most objective functions are not antimonotonic, which could fail all of frequency-centric graph mining algorithms. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive study on general mining method aiming to find most significant patterns directly. Our new mining framework, called LEAP ( Descending Leap Mine ), is developed to exploit the correlation between structural similarity and significance similarity in a way that the most significant pattern could be identified quickly by searching dissimilar graph patterns. Two novel concepts,  structural leap search  and  frequency descending mining , are proposed to support leap search in graph pattern space. Our new mining method revealed that the widely adopted branch-and-bound search in data mining literature is indeed not the best, thus sketching a new picture on scalable graph pattern discovery. Empirical results show that LEAP achieves orders of magnitude speedup in comparison with the state-of-the-art method. Furthermore, graph classifiers built on mined patterns outperform the up-to-date graph kernel method in terms of efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating the high promise of such patterns.", "citation": "Citations (329)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["IBM", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Xifeng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Xifeng", "Hong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Hong", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei", "Philip S.
