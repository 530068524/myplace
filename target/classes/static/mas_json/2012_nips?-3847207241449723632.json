We propose a general learning framework which induces sparsity on the undirected graphical model imposed on the vector of latent factors. A novel latent factor model SLFA is then proposed as a matrix factorization problem with a special regularization term that encourages collaborative reconstruction. The main benefit (novelty) of the model is that we can simultaneously learn the lower-dimensional representation for data and model the pairwise relationships between latent factors explicitly. An on-line learning algorithm is devised to make the model feasible for large-scale learning problems. Experimental results on two synthetic data and two real-world data sets demonstrate that pairwise relationships and latent factors learned by our model provide a more structured way of exploring high-dimensional data, and the learned representations achieve the state-of-the-art classification performance.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "NEC Labs America", "NEC Labs America"], "authors": ["Yunlong He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Yunlong", "Yanjun Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Yanjun", "Koray Kavukcuoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kavukcuoglu:Koray", "Haesun Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Haesun"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
