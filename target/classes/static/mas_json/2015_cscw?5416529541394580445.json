{"title": "Collective Smile: Measuring Societal Happiness from Geolocated Images.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "economic indicator", "mood", "happiness", "social media"], "abstract": "The increasing adoption of social media provides unprecedented opportunities to gain insight into human nature at vastly broader scales. Regarding the study of population-wide sentiment, prior research commonly focuses on text-based analyses and ignores a treasure trove of sentiment-laden content: images. In this paper, we make methodological and computational contributions by introducing the Smile Index as a formalized measure of societal happiness. Detecting smiles in 9 million geo-located tweets over 16 months, we validate our Smile Index against both text-based techniques and self-reported happiness. We further make observational contributions by applying our metric to explore temporal trends in sentiment, relate public mood to societal events, and predict economic indicators. Reflecting upon the innate, language-independent aspects of facial expressions, we recommend future improvements and applications to enable robust, global-level analyses. We conclude with implications for researchers studying and facilitating the expression of collective emotion through socio-technical systems.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Saeed Abdullah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdullah:Saeed", "Elizabeth L.
