This is in contrast with the approach of existing interfaces which visually separate these components. Our study, which compares L.IVE with existing popular video-based learning environments, suggests advantages in this integrated approach as compared to the separated approach in learning.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Lenovo Research ...
