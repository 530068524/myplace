{"title": "Tripartite graph clustering for dynamic sentiment analysis on social media.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "online algorithm", "clustering coefficient", "storage efficiency", "popularity"], "abstract": "The growing popularity of social media (e.g., Twitter) allows users to easily share information with each other and influence others by expressing their own sentiments on various subjects. In this work, we propose an unsupervised  tri-clustering  framework, which analyzes both user-level and tweet-level sentiments through co-clustering of a tripartite graph. A compelling feature of the proposed framework is that the quality of sentiment clustering of tweets, users, and features can be mutually improved by joint clustering. We further investigate the evolution of user-level sentiments and latent feature vectors in an online framework and devise an efficient online algorithm to sequentially update the clustering of tweets, users and features with newly arrived data. The online framework not only provides better quality of both dynamic user-level and tweet-level sentiment analysis, but also improves the computational and storage efficiency. We verified the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches on the November 2012 California ballot Twitter data.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Linhong Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Linhong", "Aram Galstyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galstyan:Aram", "James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James", "Kristina Lerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerman:Kristina"], "pages": 12}
