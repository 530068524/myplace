{"title": "The Complexity of MAP Inference in Bayesian Networks Specified Through Logical Languages.", "fields": ["jump", "determinism", "bayesian network", "inference", "maximum a posteriori estimation"], "abstract": "We study the computational complexity of finding maximum a posteriori configurations in Bayesian networks whose probabilities are specified by logical formulas. This approach leads to a fine grained study in which local information such as contextsensitive independence and determinism can be considered. It also allows us to characterize more precisely the jump from tractability to NP-hardness and beyond, and to consider the complexity introduced by evidence alone.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "Queen's University Belfast", "University of S\u00e3o Paulo"], "authors": ["Denis Deratani Mau\u00e1.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mau=aacute=:Denis_Deratani", "Cassio Polpo de Campos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Campos:Cassio_Polpo_de", "F\u00e1bio Gagliardi Cozman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cozman:F=aacute=bio_Gagliardi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
