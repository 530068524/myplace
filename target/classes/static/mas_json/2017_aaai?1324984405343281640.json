However, learning\nfrom high-dimensional context variables, such as camera images,\nis still a prominent problem in many real-world tasks.\nA naive application of unsupervised dimensionality reduction\nmethods to the context variables, such as principal component\nanalysis, is insufficient as task-relevant input may be ignored.\nIn this paper, we propose a contextual policy search method in\nthe model-based relative entropy stochastic search framework\nwith integrated dimensionality reduction. We learn a model of\nthe reward that is locally quadratic in both the policy parameters\nand the context variables. Furthermore, we perform supervised\nlinear dimensionality reduction on the context variables\nby nuclear norm regularization. The experimental results\nshow that the proposed method outperforms naive dimensionality\nreduction via principal component analysis and\na state-of-the-art contextual policy search method.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "McGill University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Voot Tangkaratt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tangkaratt:Voot", "Herke van Hoof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoof:Herke_van", "Simone Parisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parisi:Simone", "Gerhard Neumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumann:Gerhard", "Jan Peters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peters_0001:Jan", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
