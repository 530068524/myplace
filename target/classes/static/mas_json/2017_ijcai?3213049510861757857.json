{"title": "Agent Design Consistency Checking via Planning.", "fields": ["design methods", "machine learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "search problem"], "abstract": "In this work we present a novel approach to check the consistency of agent designs (prior to any implementation) with respect to the requirements specifications via automated planning. This checking is essentially a search problem which makes planning technology an appropriate solution. We focus our work on BDI agent systems and the Prometheus design methodology in order to directly compare our approach to previous work. Our experiments in more than 16K random instances prove that the approach is more effective than previous ones proposed: it achieves higher coverage, lower run-time, and importantly, can handle loops in the agent detailed design and unbounded subgoal reasoning.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "RMIT University", "RMIT University"], "authors": ["Nitin Yadav.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yadav:Nitin", "John Thangarajah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thangarajah:John", "Sebastian Sardi\u00f1a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sardi=ntilde=a:Sebastian"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
