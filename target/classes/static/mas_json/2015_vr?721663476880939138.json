The method helps achieve hands-on touch-sensitive training with dynamic physical-virtual patient behavior. The method, which is generalizable to other non-parametric rear-projection surfaces, requires one or more infrared (IR) cameras, one or more projectors, IR light sources, and a rear-projection surface. IR light reflected off of human fingers is captured by cameras with matched IR pass filters, allowing for the localization of multiple finger touch events. These events are tightly coupled with the rendering system to produce auditory and visual responses on the animated face displayed using the projector(s), resulting in a responsive, interactive experience. We illustrate the applicability of our physical prototype in a medical training scenario.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "authors": ["Jason Hochreiter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hochreiter:Jason", "Salam Daher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daher:Salam", "Arjun Nagendran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagendran:Arjun", "Laura Gonz\u00e1lez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonz=aacute=lez_0003:Laura", "Greg Welch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welch:Greg"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2015", "pages": 6}
