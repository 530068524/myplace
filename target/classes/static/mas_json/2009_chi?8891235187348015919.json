We adapted standardized measures of place attachment, social networks and psychological sense of community to provide a framework grounded in the social science literature for studying real world adoption of place-based community technologies. We found the standardized measures of place attachment and psychological sense of community meaningfully predicted likelihood of technology adoption and usage in a cafe. We discuss some lessons learned from our initial deployment of CoCollage in a real-world setting to support a nascent place-based community.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Strands, Seattle, WA, USA", "Strands, Seattle, WA, USA", "Strands, Seattle, WA, USA", "Strands, Seattle, WA, USA", "Strands, Seattle, WA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Shelly Farnham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farnham:Shelly", "Joseph F.
