{"title": "Fides: remote anomaly-based cheat detection using client emulation.", "fields": ["fides", "audit", "controller", "internet privacy", "emulation"], "abstract": "As a result of physically owning the client machine, cheaters in online games currently have the upper-hand when it comes to avoiding detection. To address this problem and turn the table on cheaters, this paper presents Fides, an anomaly-based cheat detection approach that remotely validates game execution. With Fides, a server-side Controller specifies how and when a client-side Auditor measures the game. To accurately validate measurements, the Controller partially emulates the client and collaborates with the server. This paper examines a range of cheat methods and initial measurements that counter them, showing that a Fides prototype is able to efficiently detect several existing cheats, including one state-of-the-art cheat that is advertised as \"undetectable\".", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Portland State University", "Portland State University", "Intel"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Edward C.
