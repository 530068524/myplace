However, due to the infinite-dimensional nature of the transition dynamics, performing inference in the iHMM is difficult. In this paper, we present an infinite-state Particle Gibbs (PG) algorithm to re-sample state trajectories for the iHMM. The proposed algorithm uses an efficient proposal optimized for iHMMs and leverages ancestor sampling to improve the mixing of the standard PG algorithm. Our algorithm demonstrates significant convergence improvements on synthetic and real world data sets.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Max Planck Society", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Nilesh Tripuraneni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tripuraneni:Nilesh", "Shixiang Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Shixiang", "Hong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Hong", "Zoubin Ghahramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghahramani:Zoubin"], "pages": 9}
