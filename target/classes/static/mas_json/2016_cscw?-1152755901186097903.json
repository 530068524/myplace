{"title": "Mobile Media Matters: Media Use and Relationship Satisfaction among Geographically Close Dating Couples.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "hyperpersonal model", "mobile telephony", "idealization", "mobile media"], "abstract": "Much research has investigated the uses and effects of new communication technologies in long-distance romantic relationships. Comparatively, however, the importance of these technologies within geographically close romantic relationships has been overlooked. The present study fills in this gap by examining the prevalence of media use in this context and its association with relational well-being. A survey of heterosexual undergraduates involved in proximal dating relationships (N = 211) shows that they used mobile media (phone calls, texting) to a significant extent to connect with partners on a daily basis, and that they reported high quality of communication when using these media. Further, the quality, but not quantity, of mobile communication was associated with partner idealization which, in turn, was associated with relational satisfaction. The results support and extend the Hyperpersonal model of online communication, and contribute to elucidating user practices and media effects within the critical domain of romantic relationships.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Catalina L.
