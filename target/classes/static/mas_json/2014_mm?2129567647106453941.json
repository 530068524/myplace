{"title": "Qi Visualizer: An Interactive Pulse Spectrogram Visualization using Mobile Participatory Biometrics.", "fields": ["spectrogram", "design process", "interactive art", "visual language", "data visualization"], "abstract": "Qi is an ancient concept of life energy in various cultures and it represents continuous ineffable dialogues between the human heart with the body. The goal of Qi Visualizer is to translate the ineffable dialogues into a collective data visualization of pulse spectrograms via audience participation using smartphone photoplethysmography. Informed by our earlier studies, we believe spectrogram is the most effective visual language to invoke broader perception of Qi across cultures and disciplines. In our design process, we extend our notion of audience as constituents of a system for collective expression in this novel Qi Visualizer interactive installation. Specifically, we consider audience members as objects and their responses as processes in a system to guide our visualization strategies. Significance of this work is two fold. In terms of data visualization, we streamline data acquisition and visualization processes into an immediate interactive experience in Qi Visualizer installation. In terms of interactive art, the significance may be conceived as a new process shifting tactile-textual translations in a pulse examination to imaging-visual transformations of the pulse spectrograms visualization via audience participation. Similar to voiceprint, a heart rate harmonic signature in the spectrogram is seen as an artistic interpretation of Qi in this installation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Yuan-Yi Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Yuan=Yi"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
