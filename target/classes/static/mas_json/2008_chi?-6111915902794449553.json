Social TV 2 is an interactive television solution that incorporates two ambient displays to convey to participants an aggregate view of their friends' current TV-watching status. Social TV 2 also allows users to see which television shows friends and family are watching and send lightweight messages from within the TV-viewing experience. Through a two-week field study we found the ambient displays to be an integral part of the experience. We present the results of our field study with a discussion of the implications for future social systems in the home.", "citation": "Citations (137)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Motorola", "Motorola", "Motorola", "Motorola", "Motorola"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gunnar Harboe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harboe:Gunnar", "Crysta J.
