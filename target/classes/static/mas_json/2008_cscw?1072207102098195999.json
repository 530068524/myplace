We reflect upon the deployment of a simple technological arrangement which might be construed of as a 'breaching experiment' that reveals significant challenges for technology deployment in the home. Of particular issue is the extent to which research deployments resonate with existing infrastructure and disrupt ordinary processes of domestication; the degree of ownership household members exercise over research prototypes and how this constrains domestication; and the nature of research practice and the limits this places on our understanding of domestication.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Peter Tolmie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tolmie:Peter", "Andy Crabtree.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crabtree:Andy"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
