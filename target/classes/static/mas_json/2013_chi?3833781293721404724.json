In this paper we ask whether these values can hold up in practice, particularly as participation takes on new meanings and incorporates new perspectives. We argue that much HCI research leans towards  configuring participation . In exploring this claim we explore three questions that we consider important for understanding how HCI configures participation; Who initiates, directs and benefits from user participation in design? In what forms does user participation occur? How is control shared with users in design? In answering these questions we consider the conceptual, ethical and pragmatic problems this raises for current participatory HCI research. Finally, we offer directions for future work explicitly dealing with the configuration of participation.", "citation": "Citations (168)", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "University College Cork", "Newcastle University"], "authors": ["John Vines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vines:John", "Rachel Clarke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clarke:Rachel", "Peter C.
