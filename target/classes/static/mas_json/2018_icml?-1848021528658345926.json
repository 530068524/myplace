While these agents are effective at maximizing rewards, it is often unclear what strategies they use to do so. In this paper, we take a step toward explaining deep RL agents through a case study in three Atari 2600 environments. In particular, we focus on understanding agents in terms of their visual attentional patterns during decision making. To this end, we introduce a method for generating rich saliency maps and use it to explain 1) what strong agents attend to 2) whether agents are making decisions for the right or wrong reasons, and 3) how agents evolve during the learning phase. We also test our method on non-expert human subjects and find that it improves their ability to reason about these agents. Our techniques are general and, though we focus on Atari, our long-term objective is to produce tools that explain any deep RL policy.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Samuel Greydanus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greydanus:Samuel", "Anurag Koul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koul:Anurag", "Jonathan Dodge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dodge:Jonathan", "Alan Fern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fern:Alan"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
