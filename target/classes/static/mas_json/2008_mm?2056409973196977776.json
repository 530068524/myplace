The success of query-by-concept, recently proposed to handle this problem, depends greatly on the accuracy of concept-based video indexing. This paper describes a multi-cue fusion approach toward improving the accuracy of semantic video indexing. This approach is based on a unified framework that explores and integrates both contextual correlation among concepts and temporal dependency among shots. The framework is novel in two ways. First, a recursive algorithm is proposed to learn both inter-concept and inter-shot relationships from ground-truth annotations of tens of thousands of shots for hundreds of concepts. Second, labels for all concepts and all shots are solved simultaneously through optimizing a graphical model. Experiments on the widely used TRECVID 2006 data set show that our framework is effective for semantic concept detection in video, achieving around a 30% performance boost on two popular benchmarks, VIREO-374 and Columbia374, in inferred average precision.", "citation": "Citations (40)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Ming-Fang Weng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weng:Ming=Fang", "Yung-Yu Chuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuang:Yung=Yu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
