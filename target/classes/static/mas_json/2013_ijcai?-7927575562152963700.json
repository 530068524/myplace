To solve this problem, the active learning has been studied and applied to select the informative and representative data points for labeling. However, during the early stage of experiments, only a small number (or none) of labeled data points exist, thus the most representative samples should be selected first. In this paper, we propose a novel robust active learning method to handle the early stage experimental design problem and select the most representative data points. Selecting the representative samples is an NP-hard problem, thus we employ the structured sparsity-inducing norm to relax the objective to an efficient convex formulation. Meanwhile, the robust sparse representation loss function is utilized to reduce the effect of outliers. A new efficient optimization algorithm is introduced to solve our non-smooth objective with low computational cost and proved global convergence. Empirical results on both single-label and multi-label classification benchmark data sets show the promising results of our method.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "Colorado School of Mines", "University of Texas at Arlington", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Hua Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hua", "Heng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Heng", "Chris H.
