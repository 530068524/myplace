{"title": "Cinehacking Cape Town - Embracing Informality in Pursuit of High Quality Media.", "fields": ["hacker", "multimedia", "hop", "participatory media", "computer science"], "abstract": "Although many common tools of media making such as video cameras have become more accessible in recent years, many remain inaccessible. Cinematography, lighting and sound-recording equipment for example can be prohibitively expensive to obtain, complex to configure, and/or require specialist knowledge to operate effectively. These barriers can prevent non-professionals who want to produce high-quality media from being able to. Cinehack is an ongoing project to research ways to overcome these barriers. In this paper, we specifically report on Cinehack: Cape Town, a participatory media making project. By co-producing hip hop videos within a community for whom media making is often a \"means-to-an-end\", we were able gain insights into the kinds of support needed to enable high quality media making by non-professionals. Specifically, we highlight ways to meet users' needs by embracing informal codes of practice via experimental making and peer-support.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Northumbria University", "University of York", "University of Surrey", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David Philip Green.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Green:David_Philip", "Guy Schofield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schofield:Guy", "Gary W.
