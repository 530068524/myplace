{"title": "A unified framework for concurrent security: universal composability from stand-alone non-malleability.", "fields": ["secure two party computation", "adversary", "proof of work system", "universal composability", "malleability"], "abstract": "We present a unified framework for obtaining Universally Composable (UC) protocols by relying on stand-alone secure non-malleable commitments. Essentially all results on concurrent secure computation--both in relaxed models (e.g., quasi-polynomial time simulation), or with trusted set-up assumptions (e.g., the CRS model, the imperfect CRS model, or the timing model)--are obtained as special cases of our framework. This not only leads to conceptually simpler solutions, but also to improved set-up assumptions, round-complexity, and computational assumptions.   Additionally, this framework allows us to consider new relaxed models of security: we show that UC security where the adversary is a uniform PPT but the simulator is allowed to be a non-uniform PPT (i.e., essentially, traditional UC security, but with a non-uniform reduction) is possible without any trusted set-up. This gives the first results on concurrent secure computation without set-up, which can be used for securely computing \"computationally-sensitive\" functionalities (e.g., data-base queries, \"proof of work\"-protocols, or playing bridge on the Internet).", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Huijia Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Huijia", "Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael", "Muthuramakrishnan Venkitasubramaniam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkitasubramaniam:Muthuramakrishnan"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
