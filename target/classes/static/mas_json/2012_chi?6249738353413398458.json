{"title": "Effects of behavior monitoring and perceived system benefit in online recommender systems.", "fields": ["recommender system", "human computer interaction", "multimedia", "factorial experiment", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "Behavior monitoring is an important part of many recommender systems; however, its effects on users' perceptions of such systems are not well understood. We describe a 2x2 factorial experiment that manipulates a simulated recommender system's monitoring of user behavior ( monitoring : present vs. absent) and whom the system is perceived to benefit ( benefit : corporate vs. consumer). We find that attitudes toward being monitored are moderated by perceptions about system intentions. We propose an explanatory mechanism and highlight the value of understanding the subjective experience of interacting with recommender systems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Michael Nowak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nowak:Michael", "Clifford Nass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nass:Clifford"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
