Building energy codes have recently become effective techniques to achieve efficiency targets. The Electricity and Water Authority in Bahrain has set a target of 40% reduction of building electricity consumption and CO2 emissions to be achieved by using envelope thermal insulation codes. This paper investigates the ability of the current codes to achieve such a benchmark and evaluates their impact on building energy consumption. The results of a simulation study are employed to investigate the impact of the Bahraini codes on the energy and environmental performance of buildings. The study focuses on air-conditioned commercial buildings and concludes that envelope codes, at best, are likely to reduce the energy use of the commercial sector by 25% if the building envelope is well-insulated and efficient glazing is used. Bahraini net CO2 emissions could drop to around 7.1%. The simulation results show that the current energy codes alone are not sufficient to achieve a 40% reduction benchmark, and therefore, more effort should be spent on moving towards a more comprehensive approach.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["United Arab Emirates University", "Binghamton University", "Binghamton University", "Binghamton University", "Binghamton University", "Moradabad Institute of Technology", "Moradabad Institute of Technology", "Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee", "Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee", "Louisiana State University", "Amirkabir University of Technology", "Amirkabir University of Technology", "Amirkabir University of Technology", "Inha University", "Halla University", "Inha University", "Inha University", "University of Castilla\u2013La Mancha", "University of Castilla\u2013La Mancha", "University of Castilla\u2013La Mancha", "University of Castilla\u2013La Mancha", "DIMSET, Univers ... 5 Genova, Italy"], "authors": ["Michael Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen:Michael", "Haitao Steve Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Haitao_Steve", "Emgin Ezgi Senem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Senem:Emgin_Ezgi", "Yu David Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yu_David"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2012", "pages": 20}
