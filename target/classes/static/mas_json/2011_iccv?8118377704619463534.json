We introduce a new distance between poses in this space\u2014the SRT distance. It is left-invariant, unlike Euclidean distance, and has a unique, closed-form mean, in contrast to Riemannian distance, so is fast to compute. We demonstrate improved performance over the state of the art in both recognition and registration on a real and challenging dataset, by comparing our distance with others in a mean shift framework, as well as with the commonly used Hough voting approach.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Toshiba", "Toshiba", "Toshiba", "Toshiba", "Toshiba"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Minh-Tri Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Minh=Tri", "Oliver J.
