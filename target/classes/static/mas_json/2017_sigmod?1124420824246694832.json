{"title": "A Demonstration of Interactive Analysis of Performance Measurements with Viska.", "fields": ["analytics", "data analysis", "causal inference", "data visualization", "performance measurement"], "abstract": "The ultimate goal of system performance analysis is to identify the  underlying causes  for performance differences between different systems and different workloads. We make this goal easier to achieve with Viska, a new tool for generating and interpreting performance measurement results. Viska leverages cutting-edge techniques from big data analytics and data visualization to aid and automate this analysis, and helps users derive meaningful and statistically sound conclusions using state-of-the-art causal inference and hypothesis testing techniques.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Helga Gudmundsdottir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gudmundsdottir:Helga", "Babak Salimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salimi:Babak", "Magdalena Balazinska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balazinska:Magdalena", "Dan R.
