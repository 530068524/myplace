In this paper we begin to address this deficiency, presenting progress on expanding the competency of visual SLAM systems to build richer maps. Specifically, we concentrate on modelling indoor scenes using semantically meaningful surfaces and accompanying labels, such as \u201cfloor\u201d, \u201cwall\u201d, and \u201cceiling\u201d \u2014 an important step towards a representation that can support higher-level reasoning and planning. We leverage the Manhattan world assumption and show how to extract vanishing directions jointly across a video stream. We then propose a guided line detector that utilises known vanishing points to extract extremely subtle axis\u2013 aligned edges. We utilise recent advances in single view structure recovery to building geometric scene models and demonstrate our system operating on\u2013line.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Alex Flint.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flint:Alex", "Christopher Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Christopher", "Ian D.
