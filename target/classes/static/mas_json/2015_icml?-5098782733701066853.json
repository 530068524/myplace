Unfortunately, the resulting submodular optimization problems are often too large to be solved on a single machine. We consider a distributed, greedy algorithm that combines previous approaches with randomization. The result is an algorithm that is embarrassingly parallel and achieves provable, constant factor, worstcase approximation guarantees. In our experiments, we demonstrate its efficiency in large problems with different kinds of constraints with objective values always close to what is achievable in the centralized setting.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "University of Warwick", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Warwick"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Rafael da Ponte Barbosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbosa:Rafael_da_Ponte", "Alina Ene.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ene:Alina", "Huy L.
