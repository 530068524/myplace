Given a parameter e, a d-bounded degree graph is defined to be  (k, \u03c6) -clusterable, if it can be partitioned into no more than k parts, such that the (inner) conductance of the induced subgraph on each part is at least \u03c6 and the (outer) conductance of each part is at most c d,k e 4 \u03c6 2 , where c d,k  depends only on d,k. Our main result is a sublinear algorithm with the running time ~O(\u221an \u22c5 poly(\u03c6,k,1/e)) that takes as input a graph with maximum degree bounded by d, parameters k, \u03c6, e, and with probability at least 2/3, accepts the graph if it is (k,\u03c6)-clusterable and rejects the graph if it is e-far from (k, \u03c6*)-clusterable for \u03c6* = c' d,k \u03c6 2  e 4 }/log n, where c' d,k  depends only on d,k. By the lower bound of \u03a9(\u221an) on the number of queries needed for testing graph expansion, which corresponds to k=1 in our problem, our algorithm is asymptotically optimal up to polylogarithmic factors.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Technical University of Dortmund"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Artur Czumaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czumaj:Artur", "Pan Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Pan", "Christian Sohler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sohler:Christian"], "pages": 10}
