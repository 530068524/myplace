With the advent of DIY platforms as Arduino, hardware development for embedded systems is in the reach of everybody today. These projects often build on low-fidelity systems or even prototypes and are often carried out by engineers with no strong background in electrical engineering. On the other end of the spectrum lie specialized or highly integrated platforms with much higher complexity. This paper summarizes some of the pitfalls one may encounter in both kinds of such multi-disciplinary projects and presents some general lessons that can be drawn from past experience. Lastly, we discuss the tradeoffs that come with different levels of fidelity and how user and environment may (and should) affect design decisions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Michael Beigl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beigl:Michael", "Matthias Berning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berning:Matthias", "Matthias Budde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Budde:Matthias"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
