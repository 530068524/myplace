{"title": "Exploring Syntactic Structural Features for Sub-Tree Alignment Using Bilingual Tree Kernels.", "fields": ["machine translation", "tree alignment", "tree kernel", "parse tree", "phrase"], "abstract": "We propose Bilingual Tree Kernels (BTKs) to capture the structural similarities across a pair of syntactic translational equivalences and apply BTKs to sub-tree alignment along with some plain features. Our study reveals that the structural features embedded in a bilingual parse tree pair are very effective for sub-tree alignment and the bilingual tree kernels can well capture such features. The experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement on both gold standard tree bank and automatically parsed tree pairs against a heuristic similarity based method. We further apply the sub-tree alignment in machine translation with two methods. It is suggested that the subtree alignment benefits both phrase and syntax based systems by relaxing the constraint of the word alignment.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Institute for I ... l of Computing", "Institute for I ... ocomm Research"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jun", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Min", "Chew Lim Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chew_Lim"], "pages": 10}
