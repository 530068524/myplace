{"title": "Hustling in Repeated Zero-Sum Games with Imperfect Execution.", "fields": ["stochastic game", "bayesian game", "imperfect", "common knowledge", "zero sum game"], "abstract": "We study repeated games in which players have imperfect execution skill and one player's true skill is not common knowledge. In these settings the possibility arises of a player \"hustling\", or pretending to have lower execution skill than they actually have. Focusing on repeated zero-sum games, we provide a hustle-proof strategy; this strategy maximizes a player's payoff, regardless of the true skill level of the other player.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Christopher Archibald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Archibald:Christopher", "Yoav Shoham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shoham:Yoav"], "pages": 6}
