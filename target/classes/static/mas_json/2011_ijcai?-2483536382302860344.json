Methods in biophysics only provide qualitative description of the structure and thus clarifying the collective phenomena of a huge number of water molecules is still beyond intuition in biophysics. We introduce a simulation-based data mining approach that quantitatively model the structure of water surrounding a protein as clusters of water molecules having similar moving behavior. The paper presents and explains how the advances of AI technique can potentially solve this challenging data-intensive problem.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Hieu-Chi Dam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dam:Hieu=Chi", "Tu Bao Ho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Ho:Tu_Bao", "Ayumu Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Ayumu"], "pages": 6}
