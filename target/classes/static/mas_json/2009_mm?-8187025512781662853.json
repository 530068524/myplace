LDV completion is a new form of image completion based on another large displacement view (LDV) of the same scene, no wonder, it has the potential of repairing large unknown region with salient structure information. In order to complete such unknown region, SPBP makes two important extensions over existing Priority-BP: dynamic weight of structural consistency and structural priority inheritance so as to propagate linear structure with correct priority, meanwhile it promotes texture propagation adhering to a global optimization scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that SPBP can obtain more satisfactory results than other LDV completion algorithms and it also performs well for traditional single image completion.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Nanjing University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Yingzhen Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yingzhen", "Yin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yin", "Qunsheng Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Qunsheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
