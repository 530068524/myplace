Understanding a code review is more difficult when the changeset consists of multiple, independent, code differences. We introduce C luster C hanges , an automatic technique for decomposing changesets and evaluate its effectiveness through both a quantitative analysis and a qualitative user study.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Federal University of Campina Grande", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Mike Barnett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barnett:Mike", "Christian Bird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bird:Christian", "Jo\u00e3o Brunet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brunet:Jo=atilde=o", "Shuvendu K.
