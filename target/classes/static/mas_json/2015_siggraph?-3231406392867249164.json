Automatic and effective restoration has applications in many fields such as archeological reconstruction, digital heritage archiving, forensic evidence processing, to name a few. For example, archaeologists reconstruct ceramic fragments (sherds) into complete pots in order to analyze the information of the ancient society. Forensic scientists reassemble skull fragments into complete skull for face reconstruction and body identification. In both of these problems we need to solve a composition of digitized thin-shell fragments with different shapes, sizes, and resolutions. This problem remains very challenging.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Louisiana State University", "Louisiana State University", "Louisiana State University", "Louisiana State University", "Louisiana State University"], "authors": ["Kang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Kang", "Wuyi Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Wuyi", "Mary Manhein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manhein:Mary", "Warren N.
