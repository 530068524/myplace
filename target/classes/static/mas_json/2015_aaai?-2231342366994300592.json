The problem has not been extensively studied in existing literature. In this paper, we present a formal definition of the problem of sampling representative users from social network. We propose two sampling models and theoretically prove their NP-hardness. To efficiently solve the two models, we present an efficient algorithm with provable approximation guarantees. Experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed models for sampling representative users significantly outperform (+6%-23% in terms of Precision@100) several alternative methods using authority or structure information only. The proposed algorithms are also effective in terms of time complexity. Only a few seconds are needed to sampling 300 representative users from a network of 100,000 users. All data and codes are publicly available.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Jie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang_0001:Jie", "Chenhui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chenhui", "Keke Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Keke", "Li Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Li", "Zhong Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Zhong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
