We first show that over the second-order arithmetic theory ACA0, the complementation theorem for nondeterministic tree automata is equivalent to a statement expressing the determinacy of all Gale-Stewart games given by Bool(\u221102) sets. It follows that the complementation theorem is provable from \u03a013- but not \u039413-comprehension.   We then use results due to MedSalem-Tanaka, Mollerfeld and Heinatsch-Mollerfeld to prove that   \u2022 the complementation theorem for non-deterministic tree automata,   \u2022 the decidability of the \u03a013 fragment of MSO on the infinite binary tree,   \u2022 the positional determinacy of parity games, and   \u2022 the determinacy of Bool(\u221102) Gale-Stewart games   are all equivalent over \u03a012-comprehension. It follows in particular that Rabin's decidability theorem is not provable from \u039413-comprehension.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Leszek Aleksander Kolodziejczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolodziejczyk:Leszek_Aleksander", "Henryk Michalewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michalewski:Henryk"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
