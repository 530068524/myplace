Although 3D compression algorithms have been studied in the computer graphics (CG) community for decades, the quality of the compressed 3D models are discussed only in the CG space. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between the PSNR of the compressed 3D models and the human perception to the printed objects. We conducted subjective evaluation by inviting 13 people and found that there is a clear linear relationship between them. Such a quality perception model is useful for estimating the printing quality of the compressed 3D models and deciding reasonable compression parameters.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Toshihiko Yamasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamasaki:Toshihiko", "Yusuke Nakano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakano:Yusuke", "Kiyoharu Aizawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aizawa:Kiyoharu"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
