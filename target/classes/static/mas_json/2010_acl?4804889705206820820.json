{"title": "A Hybrid Rule/Model-Based Finite-State Framework for Normalizing SMS Messages.", "fields": ["bleu", "machine translation", "spell", "normalization", "short message service"], "abstract": "In recent years, research in natural language processing has increasingly focused on normalizing SMS messages. Different well-defined approaches have been proposed, but the problem remains far from being solved: best systems achieve a 11% Word Error Rate. This paper presents a method that shares similarities with both spell checking and machine translation approaches. The normalization part of the system is entirely based on models trained from a corpus. Evaluated in French by 10-fold-cross validation, the system achieves a 9.3% Word Error Rate and a 0.83 BLEU score.", "citation": "Citations (113)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "University of Mons", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Richard Beaufort.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beaufort:Richard", "Sophie Roekhaut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roekhaut:Sophie", "Louise-Am\u00e9lie Cougnon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cougnon:Louise=Am=eacute=lie", "C\u00e9drick Fairon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fairon:C=eacute=drick"], "pages": 10}
