{"title": "Non-linear Learning for Statistical Machine Translation.", "fields": ["transfer based machine translation", "example based machine translation", "synchronous context free grammar", "linear combination", "rule based machine translation"], "abstract": "Modern statistical machine translation (SMT) systems usually use a linear combination of features to model the quality of each translation hypothesis. The linear combination assumes that all the features are in a linear relationship and constrains that each feature interacts with the rest features in an linear manner, which might limit the expressive power of the model and lead to a under-fit model on the current data. In this paper, we propose a non-linear modeling for the quality of translation hypotheses based on neural networks, which allows more complex interaction between features. A learning framework is presented for training the non-linear models. We also discuss possible heuristics in designing the network structure which may improve the non-linear learning performance. Experimental results show that with the basic features of a hierarchical phrase-based machine translation system, our method produce translations that are better than a linear model.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shujian Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Shujian", "Huadong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Huadong", "Xinyu Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Xinyu", "Jiajun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiajun"], "pages": 11}
