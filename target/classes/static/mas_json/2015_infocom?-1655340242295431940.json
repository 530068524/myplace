Our approach leverages LTE and WiFi antennas already available on smartphones to let LTE and WiFi transmit together and successfully decode the interfered signals. Our system offers several distinct advantages over existing MIMO work: (i) it can decode all the interfering signals under cross technology interference even when the interfering signals have similar power and occupy similar frequency, (ii) it does not need clean reference signals from either WiFi or LTE transmission, (iii) it can decode interfering WiFi MIMO and LTE transmissions, and (iv) it has a simple yet effective carrier sense mechanism for WiFi to access the medium under interfering LTE signals while avoiding other WiFi transmissions. We use USRP implementation and experiments to show its effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Sangki Yun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yun:Sangki", "Lili Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Lili"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
