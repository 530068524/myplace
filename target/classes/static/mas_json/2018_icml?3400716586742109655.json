{"title": "Fast and Sample Efficient Inductive Matrix Completion via Multi-Phase Procrustes Flow.", "fields": ["rate of convergence", "quadratic equation", "sample complexity", "matrix", "matrix completion"], "abstract": "We revisit the inductive matrix completion problem that aims to recover a rank-$r$ matrix with ambient dimension $d$ given $n$ features as the side prior information. The goal is to make use of the known $n$ features to reduce sample and computational complexities. We present and analyze a new gradient-based non-convex optimization algorithm that converges to the true underlying matrix at a linear rate with sample complexity only linearly depending on $n$ and logarithmically depending on $d$. To the best of our knowledge, all previous algorithms either have a quadratic dependency on the number of features in sample complexity or a sub-linear computational convergence rate. In addition, we provide experiments on both synthetic and real world data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Xiao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiao", "Simon S.
