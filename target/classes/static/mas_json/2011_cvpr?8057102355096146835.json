However, it introduces potential drifting problems due to the accumulation of errors during the self-updating, especially for occluded scenarios. The recent literature demonstrates that appropriate combinations of trackers can help balance stability and flexibility requirements. We have developed a robust tracking algorithm using a local sparse appearance model (SPT). A static sparse dictionary and a dynamically online updated basis distribution model the target appearance. A novel sparse representation-based voting map and sparse constraint regularized mean-shift support the robust object tracking. Besides these contributions, we also introduce a new dictionary learning algorithm with a locally constrained sparse representation, called K-Selection. Based on a set of comprehensive experiments, our algorithm has demonstrated better performance than alternatives reported in the recent literature.", "citation": "Citations (474)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Baiyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Baiyang", "Junzhou Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Junzhou", "Lin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Lin", "Casimir A.
