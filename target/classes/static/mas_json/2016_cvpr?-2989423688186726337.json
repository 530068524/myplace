{"title": "A 3D Morphable Model Learnt from 10, 000 Faces.", "fields": ["data modeling", "principal component analysis", "solid modeling", "bespoke", "source code"], "abstract": "We present Large Scale Facial Model (LSFM) \u2014 a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) automatically constructed from 9,663 distinct facial identities. To the best of our knowledge LSFM is the largest-scale Morphable Model ever constructed, containing statistical information from a huge variety of the human population. To build such a large model we introduce a novel fully automated and robust Morphable Model construction pipeline. The dataset that LSFM is trained on includes rich demographic information about each subject, allowing for the construction of not only a global 3DMM but also models tailored for specific age, gender or ethnicity groups. As an application example, we utilise the proposed model to perform age classification from 3D shape alone. Furthermore, we perform a systematic analysis of the constructed 3DMMs that showcases their quality and descriptive power. The presented extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that the proposed 3DMM achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing models by a large margin. Finally, for the benefit of the research community, we make publicly available the source code of the proposed automatic 3DMM construction pipeline. In addition, the constructed global 3DMM and a variety of bespoke models tailored by age, gender and ethnicity are available on application to researchers involved in medically oriented research.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Great Ormond St ... sp., London, UK", "Great Ormond St ... sp., London, UK"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["James Booth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Booth:James", "Anastasios Roussos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roussos:Anastasios", "Stefanos Zafeiriou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zafeiriou:Stefanos", "Allan Ponniah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponniah:Allan", "David Dunaway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunaway:David"], "pages": 10}
