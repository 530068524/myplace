Our innovations include: (1) a customized parallelization scheme that employs the 10 million cores efficiently at both the process and the thread levels; (2) an elaborate memory scheme that integrates on-chip halo exchange through register communcation, optimized blocking configuration guided by an analytic model, and coalesced DMA access with array fusion; (3) on-the-fly compression that doubles the maximum problem size and further improves the performance by 24%. With these innovations to remove the memory constraints of Sunway TaihuLight, our software achieves over 15% of the system's peak, better than the 11.8% efficiency achieved by a similar software running on Titan, whose byte to flop ratio is 5 times better than TaihuLight. The extreme cases demonstrate a sustained performance of over 18.9 Pflops, enabling the simulation of Tangshan earthquake as an 18-Hz scenario with an 8-meter resolution.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Shandong University", "University of Science and Technology, Sana'a"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Haohuan Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Haohuan", "Conghui He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Conghui", "Bingwei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bingwei", "Zekun Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Zekun", "Zhenguo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhenguo", "Wenqiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wenqiang", "Tingjian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Tingjian", "Wei Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Wei", "Weiguo Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Weiguo", "Wanwang Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Wanwang", "Guangwen Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Guangwen", "Xiaofei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiaofei"], "pages": 12}
