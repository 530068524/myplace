Vibrationizing is a term coined to mean the transformation of various types of information into a vibration. Funbrella is an earlier version of U-brella that allows users to experience rain with vibrations, while U-brella offers them the ability to feel ultraviolet rays by converting them into vibration. We first conceptualized the implementation of U-brella: improving the mechanism of Funbrella's vibration generator to make it lighter and easier to carry. Then we conducted a user study to confirm the efficiency of our system's vibrationizing and users' impressions of U-brella. The results showed that the participants easily perceived the amount of ultraviolet rays and that they really felt the rays pour down upon their heads with U-brella.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Kwansei Gakuin University", "Kwansei Gakuin University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Yuichi Fujii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujii:Yuichi", "Fumio Kishino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kishino:Fumio", "Kazuyuki Fujita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujita:Kazuyuki", "Yuichi Itoh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Itoh:Yuichi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
