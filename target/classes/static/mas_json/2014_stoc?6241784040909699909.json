{"title": "An efficient parallel solver for SDD linear systems.", "fields": ["system of linear equations", "spanning tree", "diagonally dominant matrix", "sparse matrix", "solver"], "abstract": "We present the first parallel algorithm for solving systems of linear equations in symmetric, diagonally dominant (SDD) matrices that runs in polylogarithmic time and nearly-linear work. The heart of our algorithm is a construction of a sparse approximate inverse chain for the input matrix: a sequence of sparse matrices whose product approximates its inverse. Whereas other fast algorithms for solving systems of equations in SDD matrices exploit low-stretch spanning trees, our algorithm only requires spectral graph sparsifiers.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Yale University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Richard Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Richard", "Daniel A.
