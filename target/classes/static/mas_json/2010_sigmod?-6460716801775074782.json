{"title": "Overview of sciDB: large scale array storage, processing and analysis.", "fields": ["risk management information systems", "extensibility", "query language", "array dbms", "petabyte"], "abstract": "SciDB [4, 3] is a new open-source data management system intended primarily for use in application domains that involve very large (petabyte) scale array data; for example, scientific applications such as astronomy, remote sensing and climate modeling, bio-science information management, risk management systems in financial applications, and the analysis of web log data. In this talk we will describe our set of motivating examples and use them to explain the features of SciDB. We then briefly give an overview of the project 'in flight', explaining our novel storage manager, array data model, query language, and extensibility frameworks.", "citation": "Citations (335)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Zetics, San Jose, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Paul G.
