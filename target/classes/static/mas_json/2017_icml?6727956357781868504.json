{"title": "Fairness in Reinforcement Learning.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "time complexity", "machine learning", "reinforcement learning", "exponential function"], "abstract": "We initiate the study of fairness in reinforcement learning, where the actions of a learning algorithm may affect its environment and future rewards. Our fairness constraint requires that an algorithm never prefers one action over another if the long-term (discounted) reward of choosing the latter action is higher. Our first result is negative: despite the fact that fairness is consistent with the optimal policy, any learning algorithm satisfying fairness must take time exponential in the number of states to achieve non-trivial approximation to the optimal policy. We then provide a provably fair polynomial time algorithm under an approximate notion of fairness, thus establishing an exponential gap between exact and approximate fairness", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Shahin Jabbari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jabbari:Shahin", "Matthew Joseph.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joseph:Matthew", "Michael J.
