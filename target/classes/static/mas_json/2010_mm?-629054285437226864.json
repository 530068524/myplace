{"title": "Torchvision the machine-vision package of torch.", "fields": ["face detection", "hidden markov model", "torch", "digital image processing", "machine vision"], "abstract": "This paper presents Torchvision an open source machine vision package for Torch. Torch is a machine learning library providing a series of the state-of-the-art algorithms such as Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Mixture Models, Hidden Markov Models and many others. Torchvision provides additional functionalities to manipulate and process images with standard image processing algorithms. Hence, the resulting images can be used directly with the Torch machine learning algorithms as Torchvision is fully integrated with Torch. Both Torch and Torchvision are written in C++ language and are publicly available under the Free-BSD License.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Idiap Research Institute", "Idiap Research Institute"], "authors": ["S\u00e9bastien Marcel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marcel:S=eacute=bastien", "Yann Rodriguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodriguez:Yann"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
