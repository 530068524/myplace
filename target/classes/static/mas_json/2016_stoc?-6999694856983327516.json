(1) An algorithm that maintains a (2+\u0454)-approximate maximum matching in general graphs with  O ( poly (log n , 1/\u0454)) update time. (2) An algorithm that maintains an \u03b1  K   approximation of the  value  of the maximum matching with  O ( n  2/ K  ) update time in bipartite graphs, for every sufficiently large constant positive integer  K . Here, 1\u2264 \u03b1  K    K . Result (1) is the first deterministic algorithm that can maintain an  o (log n )-approximate maximum matching with polylogarithmic update time, improving the seminal result of Onak et al. [STOC 2010]. Its approximation guarantee almost matches the guarantee of the best  randomized  polylogarithmic update time algorithm [Baswana et al. FOCS 2011]. Result (2) achieves a better-than-two approximation with  arbitrarily small polynomial  update time on bipartite graphs. Previously the best update time for this problem was  O ( m  1/4 ) [Bernstein et al. ICALP 2015], where  m  is the current number of edges in the graph.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Vienna", "Royal Institute of Technology", "Institute of Ma ...
