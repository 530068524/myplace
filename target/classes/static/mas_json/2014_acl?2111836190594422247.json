We develop novel features based on both models and use them as soft constraints to guide the translation process. Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that the reordering approach can significantly improve a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based translation system. However, the gain achieved by the semantic reordering model is limited in the presence of the syntactic reordering model, and we therefore provide a detailed analysis of the behavior differences between the two.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Dublin City University", "Microsoft", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Junhui Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Junhui", "Yuval Marton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marton:Yuval", "Philip Resnik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Resnik:Philip", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "pages": 11}
