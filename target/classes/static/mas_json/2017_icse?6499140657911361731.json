Operational profile-based testing  is a black-box technique that selects test cases having the largest impact on failure probability in operation; as such, it is considered well suited when reliability is a major concern.  Program spectrum  is a characterization of a program's behavior in terms of the code entities (e.g., branches, statements, functions) that are covered as the program executes. The driving idea of  covrel  is to complement operational profile information with white-box coverage measures based on count spectra, so as to dynamically select the most effective test cases for reliability improvement. In particular, we bias operational profile-based test selection towards those entities covered less frequently. We assess the approach by experiments with 18 versions from 4 subjects commonly used in software testing research, comparing results with traditional operational and coverage testing. Results show that exploiting operational and coverage data in a combined adaptive way actually pays in terms of reliability improvement, with  covrel  overcoming conventional operational testing in more than 80% of the cases.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione", "Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... , Napoli, Italy", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... , Napoli, Italy"], "authors": ["Antonia Bertolino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertolino:Antonia", "Breno Miranda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miranda:Breno", "Roberto Pietrantuono.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietrantuono:Roberto", "Stefano Russo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Russo:Stefano"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
