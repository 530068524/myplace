The proposed model achieves inter-cell interference mitigation through the dynamic and distributed self-organization of cells. Therefore, there is no need for any a prior frequency planning. Moreover, a two-level decomposition method able to find near optimal solutions is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Finally, simulation results show that compared to classic reuse schemes the proposed approach is able to pack more users into the same bandwidth, decreasing the probability of user outage.", "citation": "Citations (126)", "departments": ["King's College London", "University of Bedfordshire", "University of Bedfordshire", "Institut national des sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon", "University of Bedfordshire"], "authors": ["David L\u00f3pez-P\u00e9rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=oacute=pez=P=eacute=rez:David", "\u00c1kos Lad\u00e1nyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lad=aacute=nyi:=Aacute=kos", "Alp\u00e1r J\u00fcttner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=uuml=ttner:Alp=aacute=r", "Herv\u00e9 Rivano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rivano:Herv=eacute=", "Jie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Jie"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
