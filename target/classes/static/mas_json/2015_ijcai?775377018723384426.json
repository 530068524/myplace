One measure of simplicity for POMDP value functions is the number of \u03b1-vectors required to represent the value function. Existing POMDP methods seek to optimize the accuracy of the value function, which can require a very large number of \u03b1-vectors. This paper studies methods that allow the user to explore the tradeoff between the accuracy of the value function and the number of \u03b1-vectors. Building on previous point-based POMDP solvers, this paper introduces a new algorithm (\u03b1-min) that formulates a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to calculate approximate solutions for finite-horizon POMDP problems with limited numbers of \u03b1-vectors. At each time-step, \u03b1-min calculates \u03b1-vectors to greedily minimize the gap between current upper and lower bounds of the value function. In doing so, good upper and lower bounds are quickly reached allowing a good approximation of the problem with few \u03b1-vectors. Experimental results show that \u03b1-min provides good approximate solutions given a fixed number of \u03b1-vectors on small benchmark problems, on a larger randomly generated problem, as well as on a computational sustainability problem to best manage the endangered Sumatran tiger.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "Oregon State University", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation"], "authors": ["Yann Dujardin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dujardin:Yann", "Tom Dietterich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dietterich:Tom", "Iadine Chades.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chades:Iadine"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
