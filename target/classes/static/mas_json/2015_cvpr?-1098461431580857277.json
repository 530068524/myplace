Given a region of arbitrary shape in an image, these descriptors are formed from shape-dependent scale spaces of oriented gradients. These scale spaces are defined by Poisson-like partial differential equations. A key property of our new descriptors is that they do not aggregate image data across the boundary of the region, in contrast to existing descriptors based on aggregation of oriented gradients. As an example, we show how the descriptor can be incorporated in a Mumford-Shah energy for texture segmentation. We test our method on several challenging datasets for texture segmentation and textured object tracking. Experiments indicate that our descriptors lead to more accurate segmentation than non-shape dependent descriptors and the state-of-the-art in texture segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Naeemullah Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Naeemullah", "Marei Algarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Algarni:Marei", "Anthony J.
