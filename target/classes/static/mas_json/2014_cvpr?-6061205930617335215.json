Our method is formulated under the framework of discrete geometry processing. Unlike the existing SfG approaches, we transfer the continuous reconstruction problem into a discrete space and efficiently solve the problem via a sequence of least-square optimization steps. Our discrete formulation brings three advantages: 1) the reconstruction preserves sharp-features, 2) sparse/incomplete set of gradients can be well handled, and 3) domains of computation can have irregular boundaries. Our formulation is direct and easy to implement, and the comparisons with state-of-the-arts show the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wuyuan Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Wuyuan", "Yunbo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yunbo", "Charlie C.
