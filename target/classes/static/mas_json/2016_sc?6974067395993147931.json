{"title": "PIPES: a language and compiler for task-based programming on distributed-memory clusters.", "fields": ["exploit", "parallel algorithm", "task parallelism", "distributed memory", "compiler"], "abstract": "Applications running on clusters of shared-memory computers are often implemented using OpenMP+MPI. Productivity can be vastly improved using task-based programming, a paradigm where the user expresses the data and control-flow relations between tasks, offering the runtime maximal freedom to place and schedule tasks. While productivity is increased, high-performance execution remains challenging: the implementation of parallel algorithms typically requires specific task placement and communication strategies to reduce internode communications and exploit data locality.   In this work, we present a new macro-dataflow programming environment for distributed-memory clusters, based on the Intel Concurrent Collections (CnC) runtime. Our language extensions let the user define virtual topologies, task mappings, task-centric data placement, task and communication scheduling, etc. We introduce a compiler to automatically generate Intel CnC C++ run-time, with key automatic optimizations including task coarsening and coalescing. We experimentally validate our approach on a variety of scientific computations, demonstrating both productivity and performance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Martin Kong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kong:Martin", "Louis-No\u00ebl Pouchet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pouchet:Louis=No=euml=l", "P.
