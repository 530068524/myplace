In this paper, we take the following steps to identify phishing URLs. First, we carefully select lexical features of the URLs that are resistant to obfuscation techniques used by attackers. Second, we evaluate the classification accuracy when using only lexical features, both automatically and hand-selected, vs. when using additional features. We show that lexical features are sufficient for all practical purposes. Third, we thoroughly compare several classification algorithms, and we propose to use an online method (AROW) that is able to overcome noisy training data. Based on the insights gained from our analysis, we propose PhishDef, a phishing detection system that uses only URL names and combines the above three elements. PhishDef is a highly accurate method (when compared to state-of-the-art approaches over real datasets), lightweight (thus appropriate for online and client-side deployment), proactive (based on online classification rather than blacklists), and resilient to training data inaccuracies (thus enabling the use of large noisy training data).", "citation": "Citations (148)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Riverside"], "authors": ["Anh Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Anh", "Athina Markopoulou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markopoulou:Athina", "Michalis Faloutsos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faloutsos:Michalis"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
