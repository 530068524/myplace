{"title": "Bodies in critique: a technological intervention in the dance production process.", "fields": ["dance", "collaborative software", "hierarchy", "choreography", "social dynamics"], "abstract": "The dance production process is strongly influenced within the physical rehearsal space by social context factors and dynamics, such as intimacy of bodies, gender distribution, and the hierarchy of choreographers and dancers. Introducing online tools for asynchronous collaboration can change the traditional dance production process and impact the social dynamics of the group. We developed and deployed the Choreographer's Notebook, a web-based, collaborative, multi-modal annotation tool used in the creative process of making dance. We collected usage logs and choreographer reflections on the use of this tool, along with conducting interviews and focus groups, from the interdisciplinary perspectives of both technologists and choreographers involved in the project. We describe the socio-technical impacts of the Choreographer's Notebook based on the results of its usage in three dance productions. We analyze these case studies through various contextual lenses and provide a visualization of how the choreographic correction process evolved.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "Stanford University", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "authors": ["Erin A.
