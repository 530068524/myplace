{"title": "Z-drawing: a flying agent system for computer-assisted drawing.", "fields": ["sketch", "digital humanities", "mirroring", "storytelling", "desk"], "abstract": "We present a drone-based drawing system where a user's sketch on a desk is transformed across scale and time, and transferred onto a larger canvas at a distance in real-time. Various spatio-temporal transformations like scaling, mirroring, time stretching, recording and playing back over time, and simultaneously drawing at multiple locations allow for creating various artistic effects. The unrestricted motion of the drone promises scalability and a huge potential as an artistic medium.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sang-won Leigh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leigh:Sang=won", "Harshit Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Harshit", "Pattie Maes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maes:Pattie"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
