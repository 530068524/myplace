In this paper we present a new problem: to align book chapters with video scenes. Such an alignment facilitates finding differences between the adaptation and the original source, and also acts as a basis for deriving rich descriptions from the novel for the video clips. We propose an efficient method to compute an alignment between book chapters and video scenes using matching dialogs and character identities as cues. A major consideration is to allow the alignment to be non-sequential. Our suggested shortest path based approach deals with the non-sequential alignments and can be used to determine whether a video scene was part of the original book. We create a new data set involving two popular novel-to-film adaptations with widely varying properties and compare our method against other text-to-video alignment baselines. Using the alignment, we present a qualitative analysis of describing the video through rich narratives obtained from the novel.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Makarand Tapaswi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tapaswi:Makarand", "Martin B\u00e4uml.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=auml=uml:Martin", "Rainer Stiefelhagen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stiefelhagen:Rainer"], "pages": 9}
