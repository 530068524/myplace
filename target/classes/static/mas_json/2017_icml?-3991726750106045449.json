However, training these networks requires significant amounts of supervision. This paper introduces a generic framework to train deep networks, end-to-end, with no supervision. We propose to fix a set of target representations, called Noise As Targets (NAT), and to constrain the deep features to align to them. This domain agnostic approach avoids the standard unsupervised learning issues of trivial solutions and collapsing of features. Thanks to a stochastic batch reassignment strategy and a separable square loss function, it scales to millions of images. The proposed approach produces representations that perform on par with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on ImageNet and Pascal VOC.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["PSL Research University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Piotr Bojanowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bojanowski:Piotr", "Armand Joulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joulin:Armand"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
