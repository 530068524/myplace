In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo filtering algorithm based on kernel embeddings. The proposed method is applied to state-space models where sampling from the transition model is possible, while the observation model is to be learned from training samples without assuming a parametric model. As a theoretical basis of the proposed method, we prove consistency of the Monte Carlo method combined with kernel embeddings. Experimental results on synthetic models and real vision-based robot localization confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Graduate University for Advanced Studies", "University College London", "Graduate University for Advanced Studies", "The Institute o ... , Tokyo, Japan"], "authors": ["Motonobu Kanagawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanagawa:Motonobu", "Yu Nishiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishiyama:Yu", "Arthur Gretton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gretton:Arthur", "Kenji Fukumizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukumizu:Kenji"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
