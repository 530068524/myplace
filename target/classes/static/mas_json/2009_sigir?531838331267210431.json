{"title": "Adaptation of offline vertical selection predictions in the presence of user feedback.", "fields": ["computer science", "data mining", "situated", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Web search results often integrate content from specialized corpora known as verticals. Given a query, one important aspect of aggregated search is the selection of relevant verticals from a set of candidate verticals. One drawback to previous approaches to vertical selection is that methods have not explicitly modeled user feedback. However, production search systems often record a variety of feedback information. In this paper, we present algorithms for vertical selection which adapt to user feedback. We evaluate algorithms using a novel simulator which models performance of a vertical selector situated in realistic query traffic.", "citation": "Citations (38)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Fernando Diaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diaz_0001:Fernando", "Jaime Arguello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arguello:Jaime"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
