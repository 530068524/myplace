{"title": "HappyGo: a field trial of local group buying.", "fields": ["group buying", "negotiation", "product", "local group", "buying agent"], "abstract": "Group buying is a business model where people with the same merchandise interests form a group and conduct the purchase together to achieve a discount. Third-party proxy websites negotiate with merchants for appealing deals and then provide them to end customers. We call it online group buying. Besides, there exists local group buying where the joiners, the initiator, and sometimes even the merchants are in the same local community. Such locality induces some interesting characteristics in group buying, which remain largely unexplored in the research community. This study attempts to reveal users' behaviors in group buying within the local context. We developed a mobile service called \"HappyGo\" that supports local group buying. We conducted a trial involving more than 300 users from a company office. From our findings, we believe that local group buying complements online group buying by creating a \"local\" economic circle while also providing users with social benefits.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia", "Nokia"], "authors": ["Huanglingzi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Huanglingzi", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0074:Wei", "Dong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Dong", "Hao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0021:Hao", "Nan Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Nan"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
