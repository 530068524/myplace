The framework uses location-driven bag representations of people's daily activities obtained from celltower connections. Using 68,000+ hours of real-life human data from the Reality Mining dataset, we successfully discover various types of routines. The first studied model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), automatically discovers characteristic routines for all individuals in the study, including \"going to work at 10am\", \"leaving work at night\", or \"staying home for the entire evening\". In contrast, the second methodology with the Author Topic model (ATM) finds routines characteristic of a selected groups of users, such as \"being at home in the mornings and evenings while being out in the afternoon\", and ranks users by their probability of conforming to certain daily routines.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Katayoun Farrahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farrahi:Katayoun", "Daniel Gatica-Perez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gatica=Perez:Daniel"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
