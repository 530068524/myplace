Two neural network extensions are exploited for performance improvement. Firstly, a convolutional layer that absorbs the influences of all words in a sentence is used so that sentence-level information can be effectively captured. Secondly, a linear layer is added to integrate different order neural models and trained with perceptron method. The proposed parsers are evaluated on English and Chinese Penn Treebanks and obtain competitive accuracies.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhisong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhisong", "Hai Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Hai", "Lianhui Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Lianhui"], "pages": -1}
