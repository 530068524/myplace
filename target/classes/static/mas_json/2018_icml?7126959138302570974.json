In this paper, we look at geometric data represented as point clouds. We introduce a deep autoencoder (AE) network with excellent reconstruction quality and generalization ability. The learned representations outperform the state of the art in 3D recognition tasks and enable basic shape editing applications via simple algebraic manipulations, such as semantic part editing, shape analogies and shape interpolation. We also perform a thorough study of different generative models including GANs operating on the raw point clouds, significantly improved GANs trained in the fixed latent space our AEs and, Gaussian mixture models (GMM). Interestingly, GMMs trained in the latent space of our AEs produce samples of the best fidelity and diversity. To perform our quantitative evaluation of generative models, we propose simple measures of fidelity and diversity based on optimally matching between sets point clouds.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Panos Achlioptas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achlioptas:Panos", "Olga Diamanti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diamanti:Olga", "Ioannis Mitliagkas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitliagkas:Ioannis", "Leonidas J.
