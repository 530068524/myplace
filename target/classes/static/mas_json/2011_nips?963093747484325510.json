{"title": "Sparse Recovery with Brownian Sensing.", "fields": ["gaussian", "computation", "exponent", "brownian motion", "holder condition"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of recovering the parameter \u03b1 \u2208 \u211dK of a sparse function f (i.e. the number of non-zero entries of \u03b1 is small compared to the number K of features) given noisy evaluations of f at a set of well-chosen sampling points. We introduce an additional randomization process, called Brownian sensing, based on the computation of stochastic integrals, which produces a Gaussian sensing matrix, for which good recovery properties are proven, independently on the number of sampling points N, even when the features are arbitrarily non-orthogonal. Under the assumption that f is Holder continuous with exponent at least 1/2, we provide an estimate \u1fb6 of the parameter such that \u2225\u03b1 - \u1fb6\u22252 = O(\u2225\u03b7\u22252/\u221aN), where \u03b7 is the observation noise. The method uses a set of sampling points uniformly distributed along a one-dimensional curve selected according to the features. We report numerical experiments illustrating our method.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Alexandra Carpentier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carpentier:Alexandra", "Odalric-Ambrym Maillard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maillard:Odalric=Ambrym", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
