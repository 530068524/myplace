As well as the ability to view very high resolution local and remote video that covers a full 180#176; field of view, the system contains a number of tools which facilitate bi-directional pointing between two remote spaces. In the first quasi-naturalistic exploratory study on a focus-in-context video system, we show a number of unique object referencing behaviours, including un-intentional or 'implicit' pointing and a number of scenarios where this was advantageous. Additionally the study highlighted some of the problems inherent in aligning between screen-based and real-world perspectives.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["James Norris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norris:James", "Holger Schn\u00e4delbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schn=auml=delbach:Holger", "Guoping Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Guoping"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
