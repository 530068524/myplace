{"title": "Introspective Classification with Convolutional Nets.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "convolutional neural network", "generative grammar", "mnist database", "bayes theorem"], "abstract": "We propose introspective convolutional networks (ICN) that emphasize the importance of having convolutional neural networks empowered with generative capabilities. We employ a reclassification-by-synthesis algorithm to perform training using a formulation stemmed from the Bayes theory. Our ICN tries to iteratively: (1) synthesize pseudo-negative samples; and (2) enhance itself by improving the classification. The single CNN classifier learned is at the same time generative --- being able to directly synthesize new samples within its own discriminative model. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN using state-of-the-art CNN architectures, and observe improved classification results.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Long Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Long", "Justin Lazarow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazarow:Justin", "Zhuowen Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Zhuowen"], "pages": 11}
