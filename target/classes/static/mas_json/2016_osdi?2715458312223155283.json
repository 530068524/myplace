{"title": "GRAPHENE: Packing and Dependency-Aware Scheduling for Data-Parallel Clusters.", "fields": ["homogeneous", "independent set", "schedule", "heuristics", "cluster"], "abstract": "We present a newcluster scheduler, GRAPHENE, aimed at jobs that have a complex dependency structure and heterogeneous resource demands. Relaxing either of these challenges, i.e., scheduling a DAG of homogeneous tasks or an independent set of heterogeneous tasks, leads to NP-hard problems. Reasonable heuristics exist for these simpler problems, but they perform poorly when scheduling heterogeneous DAGs. Our key insights are: (1) focus on the long-running tasks and those with tough-to-pack resource demands, (2) compute a DAG schedule, offline, by first scheduling such troublesome tasks and then scheduling the remaining tasks without violating dependencies. These offline schedules are distilled to a simple precedence order and are enforced by an online component that scales to many jobs. The online component also uses heuristics to compactly pack tasks and to trade-off fairness for faster job completion. Evaluation on a 200-server cluster and using traces of production DAGs at Microsoft, shows that GRAPHENE improves median job completion time by 25% and cluster throughput by 30%.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Robert Grandl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grandl:Robert", "Srikanth Kandula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kandula:Srikanth", "Sriram Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Sriram", "Aditya Akella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akella:Aditya", "Janardhan Kulkarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulkarni:Janardhan"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2016", "pages": 17}
