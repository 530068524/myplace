In particular, the adversary can adaptively determine which processors to corrupt and what strategy these processors should use as the algorithm proceeds; the scheduling of the delivery of messages is set by the adversary, so that the delays are unpredictable to the algorithm; and the adversary knows the states of all processors at any time, and is assumed to be computationally unbounded. Such an adversary is also known as \"strong\". We present a polynomial expected time algorithm to solve asynchronous Byzantine Agreement with a strong adversary that controls up to a constant fraction of the processors. This is the first improvement in running time for this problem since Ben-Or's exponential expected time solution in 1983. Our algorithm tolerates an adversary that controls up to a $1/500$ fraction of the processors.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Victoria", "University of New Mexico"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Valerie King.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/King:Valerie", "Jared Saia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saia:Jared"], "pages": 10}
