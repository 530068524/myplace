{"title": "Deploying chains of virtual network functions: On the relation between link and server usage.", "fields": ["virtual network", "network dynamics", "software deployment", "path length", "networking hardware"], "abstract": "Recently, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has been proposed to transform from network hardware appliances to software middleboxes. Normally, a demand needs to invoke several Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in a particular order following the service chain along a routing path. In this paper, we study the joint problem of VNF placement and path selection to better utilize the network. We discover that the relation between the link and server usage plays a crucial role in the problem. We first propose a systematic way to elastically tune the proper link and server usage of each demand based on network conditions and demand properties. In particular, we compute a proper routing path length, and decide, for each VNF in the service chain, whether to use additional server resources or to reuse resources provided by existing servers. We then propose a chain deployment algorithm to follow the guidance of this link and server usage. Via simulations, we show that our design effectively adapts resource usage to network dynamics, and, hence, serves more demands than other heuristics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Center for Information Technology", "National Tsing Hua University", "Center for Information Technology", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Chengchi University", "National Tsing Hua University", "National Chiao Tung University", "National Tsing Hua University"], "authors": ["Tung-Wei Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Tung=Wei", "Bang-Heng Liou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liou:Bang=Heng", "Kate Ching-Ju Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Kate_Ching=Ju", "Ming-Jer Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Ming=Jer"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
