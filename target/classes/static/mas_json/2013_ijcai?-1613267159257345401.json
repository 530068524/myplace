{"title": "Listening to the Crowd: Automated Analysis of Events via Aggregated Twitter Sentiment.", "fields": ["ceremony", "criticism", "lexicon", "active listening", "praise"], "abstract": "Individuals often express their opinions on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook during public events such as the U.S. Presidential debate and the Oscar awards ceremony. Gleaning insights from these posts is of importance to analyzing the impact of the event. In this work, we consider the problem of identifying the segments and topics of an event that garnered praise or criticism, according to aggregated Twitter responses. We propose a flexible factorization framework, SOCSENT, to learn factors about segments, topics, and sentiments. To regulate the learning process, several constraints based on prior knowledge on sentiment lexicon, sentiment orientations (on a few tweets) as well as tweets alignments to the event are enforced. We implement our approach using simple update rules to get the optimal solution. We evaluate the proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively on two large-scale tweet datasets associated with two events from different domains to show that it improves significantly over baseline models.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "IBM", "Arizona State University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yuheng Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yuheng", "Fei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Fei", "Subbarao Kambhampati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kambhampati:Subbarao"], "pages": 7}
