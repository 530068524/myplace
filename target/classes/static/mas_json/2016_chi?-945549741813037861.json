{"title": "An Actionable Approach to Understand Group Experience in Complex, Multi-surface Spaces.", "fields": ["collaborative software", "human computer interaction", "design studio", "computer science"], "abstract": "There is a steadily growing interest in the design of spaces in which multiple interactive surfaces are present and, in turn, in understanding their role in group activity. However, authentic activities in these multi-surface spaces can be complex. Groups commonly use digital and non-digital artefacts, tools and resources, in varied ways depending on their specific social and epistemic goals. Thus, designing for collaboration in such spaces can be very challenging. Importantly, there is still a lack of agreement on how to approach the analysis of groups' experiences in these heterogeneous spaces. This paper presents an actionable approach that aims to address the complexity of understanding multi-user multi-surface systems. We provide a structure for applying different analytical tools in terms of four closely related dimensions of user activity: the setting, the tasks, the people and the runtime co-configuration. The applicability of our approach is illustrated with six types of analysis of group activity in a multi-surface design studio.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Roberto Mart\u00ednez Maldonado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maldonado:Roberto_Mart=iacute=nez", "Peter Goodyear.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goodyear:Peter", "Judy Kay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kay:Judy", "Kate Thompson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thompson:Kate", "Lucila Carvalho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carvalho:Lucila"], "pages": 13}
