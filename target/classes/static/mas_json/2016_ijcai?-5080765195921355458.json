{"title": "Modeling Contagious Merger and Acquisition via Point Processes with a Profile Regression Prior.", "fields": ["point process", "restructuring", "covariate", "phenomenon", "critical practice"], "abstract": "Merger and Acquisition (M&A) has been a critical practice about corporate restructuring. Previous studies are mostly devoted to evaluating the suitability of M&A between a pair of investor and target company, or a target company for its propensity of being acquired. This paper focuses on the dual problem of predicting an investor's prospective M&A based on its activities and firmographics. We propose to use a mutually-exciting point process with a regression prior to quantify the investor's M&A behavior. Our model is motivated by the so-called contagious 'wave-like' M&A phenomenon, which has been well-recognized by the economics and management communities. A tailored model learning algorithm is devised that incorporates both static profile covariates and past M&A activities. Results on CrunchBase suggest the superiority of our model. The collected dataset and code will be released together with the paper.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["East China Normal University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "IBM", "East China Normal University", "East China Normal University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Junchi Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Junchi", "Shuai Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Shuai", "Changsheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Changsheng", "Bo Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Bo", "Xiangfeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiangfeng", "Bin Ke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ke:Bin", "Xiaokang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiaokang", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan"], "pages": 7}
