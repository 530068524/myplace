{"title": "Generating occlusion-free textures for virtual 3D model of urban facades by fusing image and laser street data.", "fields": ["facade", "georeference", "point cloud", "mobile mapping", "image texture"], "abstract": "In this paper we present relevant results of a work in progress 1  that deals with the texturing of 3D urban facade models by fusing terrestrial multi-source data acquired by a Mobile Mapping System (MMS). Some of current 3D urban facade models often are textured by using images that contain parts of urban objects that belong to the street. These urban objects represent in this case occlusions since they are located between the acquisition system and the facades. We show the potential use of georeferenced images and 3D point cloud that are acquired at street level by the MMS in generating occlusion-free facade textures. We describe a methodology for reconstructing texture parts of facades that are highly occluded by wide frontal objects.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Maynooth University", "University of the Basque Country", "Institut g\u00e9ographique national", "Institut g\u00e9ographique national", "Institut g\u00e9ographique national"], "authors": ["Karim Hammoudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hammoudi:Karim", "Fadi Dornaika.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dornaika:Fadi", "Bahman Soheilian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soheilian:Bahman", "Bruno Vallet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vallet:Bruno", "Nicolas Paparoditis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paparoditis:Nicolas"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
