Because omnistereo lenses or mirrors do not yet exist, synthesizing omnistereo images requires multiple stereo camera positions and baseline orientations. Recent omnistereo methods stitch together many small field of view images called slits which are captured by one or two cameras following a circular motion. However, these methods produce omnistereo images for static scenes only. The situation is much more challenging for dynamic scenes since stitching needs to occur over both space and time and should synchronize the motion between left and right views as much as possible. This paper presents the first ever method for synthesizing panoramic stereo video textures. The method uses full frames rather than slits and uses blending across seams rather than smoothing or matching based on graph cuts. The method produces loopable panoramic stereo videos that can be displayed up to 360 degrees around a viewer.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "McGill University", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Vincent Chapdelaine-Couture.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chapdelaine=Couture:Vincent", "Michael S.
