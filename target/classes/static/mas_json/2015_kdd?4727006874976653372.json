{"title": "Scalable Large Near-Clique Detection in Large-Scale Networks via Sampling.", "fields": ["induced subgraph isomorphism problem", "complete bipartite graph", "clique", "subgraph isomorphism problem", "split graph"], "abstract": "Extracting dense subgraphs from large graphs is a key primitive in a variety of graph mining applications, ranging from mining social networks and the Web graph to bioinformatics [41]. In this paper we focus on a family of poly-time solvable formulations, known as the  k-clique densest subgraph problem  (k-Clique-DSP) [57]. When  k =2, the problem becomes the well-known   densest subgraph problem  (DSP) [22, 31, 33, 39]. Our main contribution is a sampling scheme that gives  densest subgraph sparsifier , yielding a randomized algorithm that produces high-quality approximations while providing significant speedups and improved space complexity. We also extend this family of formulations to bipartite graphs by introducing the ( p , q ) -biclique densest subgraph problem  ((p,q)-Biclique-DSP), and devise an exact algorithm that can treat both clique and biclique densities in a unified way.   As an example of performance, our sparsifying algorithm extracts the 5-clique densest subgraph --which is a large-near clique on 62 vertices-- from a large collaboration network. Our algorithm achieves 100% accuracy over five runs, while achieving an average speedup factor of over 10,000. Specifically, we reduce the running time from \u223c2 107 seconds to an average running time of 0.15 seconds. We also use our methods to study how the  k -clique densest subgraphs change as a function of time in time-evolving networks for various small values of  k . We observe significant deviations between the experimental findings on real-world networks and stochastic Kronecker graphs, a random graph model that mimics real-world networks in certain aspects.   We believe that our work is a significant advance in routines with rigorous theoretical guarantees for scalable extraction of large near-cliques from networks.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Michael Mitzenmacher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitzenmacher:Michael", "Jakub Pachocki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pachocki:Jakub", "Richard Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Richard", "Charalampos E.
