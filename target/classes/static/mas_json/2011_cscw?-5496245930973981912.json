In this paper we describe a software solution to a multidirectional gaze display in shared-display collaborative tasks and we report on initial results of an experiment in which the system was applied to allow gaze display in a remote pair-programming lecture. Remotely, an expert was explaining two algorithms to a novice who then attempted to apply the algorithm on an unseen problem. We report on an analysis of data from the conditions when there was a gaze transmitted and displayed to the peer with the no-gaze condition. The remote gaze display reliably affected the variability of novices visual attention patterns and they were better able to focus on the information presented. Without the experts gaze display their strategies contained greater variety.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Eastern Finland", "University of Eastern Finland", "University of Eastern Finland"], "authors": ["Roman Bednarik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bednarik:Roman", "Andrey Shipilov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shipilov:Andrey", "Sami Pietinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietinen:Sami"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
