Given the extensive use of convex optimization in machine learning and statistics, gaining a understanding of these complexity-theoretic issues is important. In this paper, we study the complexity of stochastic convex optimization in an oracle model of computation. We improve upon known results and obtain tight minimax complexity estimates for various function classes. We also discuss implications of these results for the understanding the inherent complexity of large-scale learning and estimation problems.", "citation": "Citations (196)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Alekh Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Alekh", "Peter L.
