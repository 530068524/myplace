{"title": "Revisiting Computer-Mediated Intimacy: In-Game Marriage and Dyadic Gameplay in Audition.", "fields": ["dance", "experience design", "computer supported cooperative work", "social dynamics", "social space"], "abstract": "Existing studies in the field of HCI and CSCW have pointed to the significance to investigate computer-mediated intimacy and brought together concerns in ubiquitous computing, affective technologies, and experience design. However, existing conceptualizations of intimacy in collaborative online systems are largely based on empirical studies of systems that have similar social dynamics and user groups, which could lead to a bias in investigating intimacy. Using Audition, a dance battle Multiplayer Online Game with a popular marriage system, as our field site, we focus on dyadic intimacy in a non-violent online social space that has many young non-Caucasian and female users. We contribute to both confirming and further advancing existing theories of computer-mediated intimacy using this new dataset. We also suggest promising future directions for exploring the subjective intimate experiences in a scientifically defensible way.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Cincinnati", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Guo Freeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freeman:Guo", "Jeffrey Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Jeffrey", "Shaowen Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Shaowen"], "pages": 12}
