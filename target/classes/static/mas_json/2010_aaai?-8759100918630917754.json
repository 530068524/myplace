The process starts with a single hypercube approximation of the set of SPE payoff profiles. Then the initial hypercube is gradually partitioned on to a set of smaller adjacent hypercubes, while those hypercubes that cannot contain any SPE point are gradually withdrawn. Whether a given hypercube can contain an equilibrium point is verified by an appropriate mixed integer program. A special attention is paid to the question of extracting players' strategies and their representability in form of finite automata.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Laval University", "Laval University"], "authors": ["Andriy Burkov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burkov:Andriy", "Brahim Chaib-draa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaib=draa:Brahim"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
