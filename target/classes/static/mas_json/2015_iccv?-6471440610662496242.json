{"title": "Joint Probabilistic Data Association Revisited.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "linear programming", "joint probabilistic data association filter", "clutter", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) technique and propose a novel solution based on recent developments in finding the m-best solutions to an integer linear program. The key advantage of this approach is that it makes JPDA computationally tractable in applications with high target and/or clutter density, such as spot tracking in fluorescence microscopy sequences and pedestrian tracking in surveillance footage. We also show that our JPDA algorithm embedded in a simple tracking framework is surprisingly competitive with state-of-the-art global tracking methods in these two applications, while needing considerably less processing time.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide", "Northwestern University", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Seyed Hamid Rezatofighi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rezatofighi:Seyed_Hamid", "Anton Milan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milan:Anton", "Zhen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhen", "Qinfeng Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Qinfeng", "Anthony R.
