While this direction of research is promising, the computation of game-theoretic centrality can be challenging. In an attempt to address the computational issues of game-theoretic network centrality, we present a generic framework for constructing game-theoretic network centralities. We prove that all extensions that can be expressed in this framework are computable in polynomial time. Using our framework, we present the first game-theoretic extensions of weighted and normalized degree centralities, impact factor centrality, distance-scaled and normalized betweenness centrality, and closeness and normalized closeness centralities.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Warsaw University of Technology", "University of Oxford", "University of Warsaw", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Piotr Lech Szczepanski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szczepanski:Piotr_Lech", "Mateusz Krzysztof Tarkowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarkowski:Mateusz_Krzysztof", "Tomasz Pawel Michalak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michalak:Tomasz_Pawel", "Paul Harrenstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrenstein:Paul", "Michael Wooldridge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wooldridge:Michael"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
