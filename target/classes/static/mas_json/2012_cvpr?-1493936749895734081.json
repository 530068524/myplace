{"title": "What are good parts for hair shape modeling?", "fields": ["parameter identification problem", "subspace topology", "cluster analysis", "markov process", "statistic"], "abstract": "Hair plays an important role in human appearance. However, hair segmentation is still a challenging problem partially due to the lack of an effective model to handle its arbitrary shape variations. In this paper, we present a part-based model robust to hair shape and environment variations. The key idea of our method is to identify local parts by promoting the effectiveness of the part-based model. To this end, we propose a measurable statistic, called Subspace Clustering Dependency (SC-Dependency), to estimate the co-occurrence probabilities between local shapes. SC-Dependency guarantees output reasonability and allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of part-wise constraints in an information-theoretic way. Then we formulate the part identification problem as an MRF that aims to optimize the effectiveness of the potential functions. Experiments are performed on a set of consumer images and show our algorithm's capability and robustness to handle hair shape variations and extreme environment conditions.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Hewlett-Packard"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Nan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Nan", "Haizhou Ai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ai:Haizhou", "Feng Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Feng"], "pages": 8}
