Recent advances in smartphone technology have enabled a number of interaction techniques for smartphone that use tactile feedback to deliver navigation information. The aim is to enable eyes-free usage and avoid distracting the user from the environment. Field studies where participants had to fulfill given navigation tasks, have found these techniques to be efficient and beneficial in terms of distraction. But it is not yet clear whether these findings will replicate in in-situ usage. We, therefore, developed a Google Maps-like navigation application that incorporates interaction techniques proposed in previous work. The application was published for free on the Android Market and so people were able to use it as a navigation system in their everyday life. The data collected through anonymous monitoring suggests that tactile feedback is successfully adopted in one third of all trips and has positive effects on the user's level of distraction.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["OFFIS", "OFFIS", "OFFIS", "University of Oldenburg"], "authors": ["Martin Pielot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pielot:Martin", "Benjamin Poppinga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poppinga:Benjamin", "Wilko Heuten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heuten:Wilko", "Susanne Boll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boll:Susanne"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
