Further, travel costs such as travel time and GHG emissions are time-dependent and uncertain. To support such uses, we propose techniques that enable the construction of a multi-cost, time-dependent, uncertain graph (MTUG) model of a road network based on GPS data from vehicles that traversed the road network. Based on the MTUG, we define stochastic skyline routes that consider multiple costs and time-dependent uncertainty, and we propose efficient algorithms to retrieve stochastic skyline routes for a given source-destination pair and a start time. Empirical studies with three road networks in Denmark and a substantial GPS data set offer insight into the design properties of the MTUG and the efficiency of the stochastic skyline routing algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "Aalborg University", "Aarhus University", "China University of Petroleum"], "authors": ["Bin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Bin", "Chenjuan Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Chenjuan", "Christian S.
