{"title": "Collaborative Gaussian Processes for Preference Learning.", "fields": ["approximate inference", "expectation propagation", "preference learning", "semi supervised learning", "dimensionality reduction"], "abstract": "We present a new model based on Gaussian processes (GPs) for learning pair-wise preferences expressed by multiple users. Inference is simplified by using a preference kernel for GPs which allows us to combine supervised GP learning of user preferences with unsupervised dimensionality reduction for multi-user systems. The model not only exploits collaborative information from the shared structure in user behavior, but may also incorporate user features if they are available. Approximate inference is implemented using a combination of expectation propagation and variational Bayes. Finally, we present an efficient active learning strategy for querying preferences. The proposed technique performs favorably on real-world data against state-of-the-art multi-user preference learning algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Neil Houlsby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Houlsby:Neil", "Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hern=aacute=ndez=Lobato:Jos=eacute=_Miguel", "Ferenc Huszar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huszar:Ferenc", "Zoubin Ghahramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghahramani:Zoubin"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
