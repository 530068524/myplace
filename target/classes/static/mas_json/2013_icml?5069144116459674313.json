In this paper, we develop a new computationally efficient and provably consistent estimator for a mixture of linear regressions, a simple instance of a discriminative latent-variable model. Our approach relies on a low-rank linear regression to recover a symmetric tensor, which can be factorized into the parameters using a tensor power method. We prove rates of convergence for our estimator and provide an empirical evaluation illustrating its strengths relative to local optimization (EM).", "citation": "Citations (89)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Arun Tejasvi Chaganty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaganty:Arun_Tejasvi", "Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
