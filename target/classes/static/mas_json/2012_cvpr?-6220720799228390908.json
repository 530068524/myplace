Unfortunately, these approaches utilize high order potentials which are computationally intractable and rely on ad-hoc approximations for both learning and inference. In this paper we show that the potentials commonly used in the literature can be decomposed into pair-wise potentials by extending the concept of integral images to geometry. As a consequence no heuristic reduction of the search space is required. In practice, this results in large improvements in performance over the state-of-the-art, while being orders of magnitude faster.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "TTI Chicago", "TTI Chicago"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Alexander G.
