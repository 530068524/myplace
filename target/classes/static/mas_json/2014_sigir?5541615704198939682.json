{"title": "Principled dictionary pruning for low-memory corpus compression.", "fields": ["dictionary coder", "substring", "incremental encoding", "memory hierarchy", "k svd"], "abstract": "Compression of collections, such as text databases, can both reduce space consumption and increase retrieval efficiency, through better caching and better exploitation of the memory hierarchy. A promising technique is relative Lempel-Ziv coding, in which a sample of material from the collection serves as a static dictionary; in previous work, this method demonstrated extremely fast decoding and good compression ratios, while allowing random access to individual items. However, there is a trade-off between dictionary size and compression ratio, motivating the search for a compact, yet similarly effective, dictionary. In previous work it was observed that, since the dictionary is generated by sampling, some of it (selected substrings) may be discarded with little loss in compression. Unfortunately, simple dictionary pruning approaches are ineffective. We develop a formal model of our approach, based on generating an optimal dictionary for a given collection within a memory bound. We generate measures for identification of low-value substrings in the dictionary, and show on a variety of sizes of text collection that halving the dictionary size leads to only marginal loss in compression ratio. This is a dramatic improvement on previous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Nankai University", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Jiancong Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Jiancong", "Anthony Wirth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wirth:Anthony", "Justin Zobel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zobel:Justin"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
