By using small-size programmable hardware and wearable sensors, any display device (referred to as display surface) can act as a thin client for users to interact with the different remote devices. Under a flexible system architecture for local and remote devices' communication and collaboration, several techniques, such as adaptive screen compression, interactive ROI control, and accelerometer-based pointing input, are developed to improve the system performance and user experience. Evaluations show that the proposed system can efficiently utilize the remote computing resources and local display capabilities of ubiquitous devices, which will greatly benefit interactive multimedia applications.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Wen Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Wen", "Yan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0001:Yan", "Shipeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shipeng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
