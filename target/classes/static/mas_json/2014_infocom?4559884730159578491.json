A promising bandwidth expansion possibility presents itself through the release of large TV band spectra by FCC for cognitive access. One of the primary challenges of the so-called TV White Space (TVWS) access in vehicular networks is the design of efficient channel allocation mechanisms in face of high vehicular mobility and spatial-temporal variations of TVWS. In this paper, we address the channel allocation problem for multi-channel cognitive vehicular networks with the objective of system-wide throughput maximization. We show that the problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, to which we present two solution approaches. We first propose a probabilistic polynomialtime (1 \u2212 1/e)-approximation algorithm based on linear programming. Next, we prove that our objective function can be written as a submodular set function, based on which we develop a deterministic polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm with a more favorable time complexity. Finally, we show the efficacy of our algorithms through numerical examples.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Toyota", "Toyota"], "authors": ["You Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:You", "Eylem Ekici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ekici:Eylem", "Haris Kremo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kremo:Haris", "Onur Altintas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altintas:Onur"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
