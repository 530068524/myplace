{"title": "Scalable Active Learning by Approximated Error Reduction.", "fields": ["graph", "machine learning", "artificial intelligence", "scalability", "active learning"], "abstract": "We study the problem of active learning for multi-class classification on large-scale datasets. In this setting, the existing active learning approaches built upon uncertainty measures are ineffective for discovering unknown regions, and those based on expected error reduction are inefficient owing to their huge time costs. To overcome the above issues, this paper proposes a novel query selection criterion called approximated error reduction (AER). In AER, the error reduction of each candidate is estimated based on an expected impact over all datapoints and an approximated ratio between the error reduction and the impact over its nearby datapoints. In particular, we utilize hierarchical anchor graphs to construct the candidate set as well as the nearby datapoint sets of these candidates. The benefit of this strategy is that it enables a hierarchical expansion of candidates with the increase of labels, and allows us to further accelerate the AER estimation. We finally introduce AER into an efficient semi-supervised classifier for scalable active learning. Experiments on publicly available datasets with the sizes varying from thousands to millions demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hefei University of Technology", "Hefei University of Technology", "Hefei University of Technology", "Hefei University of Technology"], "authors": ["Weijie Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Weijie", "Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Meng", "Shijie Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Shijie", "Xindong Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xindong"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
