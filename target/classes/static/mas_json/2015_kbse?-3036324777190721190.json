{"title": "Generating Qualifiable Avionics Software: An Experience Report (E).", "fields": ["verification and validation", "avionics software", "package development process", "do 178b", "social software engineering"], "abstract": "We report on our experience with enhancing the data-management component in the avionics software of the NH90 helicopter at Airbus Helicopters. We describe challenges regarding the evolution of avionics software by means of real-world evolution scenarios that arise in industrial practice. A key role plays a legally-binding certification process, called qualification, which is responsible for most of the development effort and cost. To reduce effort and cost, we propose a novel generative approach to develop qualifiable avionics software by combining model-based and product-line technology. Using this approach, we have already generated code that is running on the NH90 helicopter and that is in the process of replacing the current system code. Based on an interview with two professional developers at Airbus and an analysis of the software repository of the NH90, we systematically compare our approach with established development approaches in the avionics domain, in terms of implementation and qualification effort.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "University of Passau", "Airbus"], "authors": ["Andreas W\u00f6lfl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/W=ouml=lfl:Andreas", "Norbert Siegmund.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siegmund:Norbert", "Sven Apel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apel:Sven", "Harald Kosch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosch:Harald", "Johann Krautlager.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krautlager:Johann", "Guillermo Weber-Urbina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weber=Urbina:Guillermo"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
