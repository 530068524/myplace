However, since a node in graph data oftentimes represents a person, node-DP is necessary to achieve personal data protection. In this paper, we investigate the problem of publishing the degree distribution of a graph under node-DP by exploring the projection approach to reduce the sensitivity. We propose two approaches based on aggregation and cumulative histogram to publish the degree distribution. The experiments demonstrate that our approaches greatly reduce the error of approximating the true degree distribution and have significant improvement over existing works. We also present the introspective analysis for understanding the factors of publishing the degree distribution with node-DP.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Wei-Yen Day.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Day:Wei=Yen", "Ninghui Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ninghui", "Min Lyu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyu:Min"], "pages": 16}
