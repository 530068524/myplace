As part of a larger study on social media and information behaviors, we surveyed 158 high school students to learn about their online question asking and answering practices. We describe which teens are most likely to ask and answer questions, what they ask about, on which sites they ask questions, and how useful they perceive SNSs to be as information sources. When possible, we draw comparisons with findings in the literature about adult populations. We contextualize these findings using early insights from interviews and focus groups with 80 teens and discuss how perceptions of audience, privacy concerns, and self-presentation all play a role in teens' use of SNSs to ask and answer questions.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "authors": ["Andrea Forte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forte:Andrea", "Michael Dickard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dickard:Michael", "Rachel M.
