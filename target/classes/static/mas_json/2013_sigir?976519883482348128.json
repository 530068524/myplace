The method is shown to be generic in that it covers most of the popular QE models as special cases and flexible in that it provides a principled mathematical framework in which a wide variety of information useful for QE can be incorporated in a unified way. Evaluation is performed on the Web document ranking task using a real-world data set. Results show that the PCRW-based method is very effective for the expansion of rare queries, i.e., low-frequency queries that are unseen in search logs, and that it outperforms significantly other state-of-the-art QE meth-ods.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jianfeng Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jianfeng", "Gu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Gu", "Jinxi Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jinxi"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
