In order to enhance effective observation and control over wild life, we have built a wireless sensor network. 25 video transmitting nodes are installed for animal behavior observation and experimental vibrotactile collars have been designed for effective control in an animal park.   The goal of our research is two-folded. Firstly, to provide an interaction between digital users and animals, and monitor the animal behavior for safety purposes. Secondly, we investigate how animals can be controlled or trained based on vibrotactile stimuli instead of electric stimuli.   We have designed a multimedia sensor network for human animal machine interaction. We have evaluated the effect of human animal machine state communication model in field experiments.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Ume\u00e5 University", "Ume\u00e5 University", "Ume\u00e5 University", "Ume\u00e5 University", "Ume\u00e5 University"], "authors": ["Karin Fahlquist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fahlquist:Karin", "Johannes Karlsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karlsson:Johannes", "Haibo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Haibo", "Li Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Li", "Keni Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Keni", "Shafiq ur R\u00e9hman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=eacute=hman:Shafiq_ur", "Tim Wark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wark:Tim"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 6}
