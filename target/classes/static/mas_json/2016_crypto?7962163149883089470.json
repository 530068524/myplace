{"title": "Extended Tower Number Field Sieve: A New Complexity for the Medium Prime Case.", "fields": ["prime", "algebraic number field", "logarithm", "pairing", "general number field sieve"], "abstract": "We introduce a new variant of the number field sieve algorithm for discrete logarithms in $$\\mathbb {F}_{p^n}$$ called exTNFS. The most important modification is done in the polynomial selection step, which determines the cost of the whole algorithm: if one knows how to select good polynomials to tackle discrete logarithms in $$\\mathbb {F}_{p^\\kappa }$$, exTNFS allows to use this method when tackling $$\\mathbb {F}_{p^{\\eta \\kappa }}$$ whenever $$\\gcd \\eta ,\\kappa =1$$. This simple fact has consequences on the asymptotic complexity of NFS in the medium prime case, where the complexity is reduced from $$L_Q1/3,\\root 3 \\of {96/9}$$ to $$L_Q1/3,\\root 3 \\of {48/9}$$, $$Q=p^n$$, respectively from $$L_Q1/3,2.15$$ to $$L_Q1/3,1.71$$ if multiple number fields are used. On the practical side, exTNFS can be used when $$n=6$$ and $$n=12$$ and this requires to updating the keysizes used for the associated pairing-based cryptosystems.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "NTT Secure Plat ... , Tokyo, Japan"], "authors": ["Taechan Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Taechan", "Razvan Barbulescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbulescu:Razvan"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2016", "pages": 29}
