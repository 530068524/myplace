We conducted a user study to record eye movements of four participants over a full day of their daily life, totalling 42.5 hours of eye movement data. Participants were asked to self-annotate four non-mutually exclusive cues:  social  (interacting with somebody vs. no interaction),  cognitive  (concentrated work vs. leisure),  physical  (physically active vs. not active), and  spatial  (inside vs. outside a building). We evaluate a proof-of-concept EyeContext system that combines encoding of eye movements into strings and a spectrum string kernel support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our results demonstrate the large information content available in long-term human visual behaviour and opens up new venues for research on eye-based behavioural monitoring and life logging.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["Andreas Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Andreas", "Christian Weichel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weichel:Christian", "Hans Gellersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gellersen:Hans"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
