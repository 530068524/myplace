{"title": "Sub-document Timestamping of Web Documents.", "fields": ["web archiving", "web server", "timestamping", "web standards", "web mapping"], "abstract": "Knowledge about a (Web) document's creation time has been shown to be an important factor in various temporal information retrieval settings. Commonly, it is assumed that such documents were created at a single point in time. While this assumption may hold for news articles and similar document types, it is a clear oversimplification for general Web documents. In this paper, we investigate to what extent (i) this simplifying assumption is violated for a corpus of Web documents, and, (ii) it is possible to accurately estimate the creation time of individual Web documents' components (so-called sub-documents).", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Yue Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yue", "Claudia Hauff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hauff:Claudia"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
