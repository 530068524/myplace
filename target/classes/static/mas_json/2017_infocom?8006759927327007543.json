In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel Location basEd Source Switching (LESS) for datacenter networks. LESS enables lightweight source switching through a location-based addressing scheme. Each switch and host can independently derive a source route to reach a destination without requiring the full knowledge of the network topology. We demonstrate that using location-based source routes as forwarding labels allows LESS to eliminate the need for routing tables and integrate with minimum required functionality for packet forwarding. Moreover, we propose a fast rerouting solution to address the issue of fault tolerance in source routing. Each switch can locally derive an alternative source route during a failure. The paper evaluates the performance of LESS. Our evaluation results suggest that LESS improves the performance of datacenter networks in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Liberty University", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"], "conf": "infocom", "authors": ["Feng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0017:Feng", "Lixin Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Lixin", "Xiaozhe Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Xiaozhe", "Hiroaki Harai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harai:Hiroaki", "Kenji Fujikawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujikawa:Kenji"], "pages": 9}
