{"title": "Incentivizing Reliability in Demand-Side Response.", "fields": ["microeconomics", "willingness to accept", "demand reduction", "small number", "payment"], "abstract": "We study the problem of incentivizing reliable demand-response in modern electricity grids. Each agent is uncertain about her future ability to reduce demand and unreliable. Agents who choose to participate in a demand-response scheme may be paid when they respond and penalized otherwise. The goal is to reliably achieve a demand reduction target while selecting a minimal set of agents from those willing to participate. We design incentive-aligned, direct and indirect mechanisms. The direct mechanism elicits both response probabilities and costs, while the indirect mechanism elicits willingness to accept a penalty in the case of non-response. We benchmark against a spot auction, in which demand reduction is purchased from agents when needed. Both the direct and indirect mechanisms achieve the reliability target in a dominant-strategy equilibrium, select a small number of agents to prepare, and do so at low cost and with much lower variance in payments than the spot auction.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Heriot-Watt University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Hongyao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Hongyao", "Valentin Robu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robu:Valentin", "Na Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Na", "David C.
