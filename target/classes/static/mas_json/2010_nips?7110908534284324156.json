We first consider the case of jump-diffusion processes, where the drift of a linear stochastic differential equation can jump at arbitrary time points. We derive partial differential equations for exact inference and present a very efficient mean field approximation. By introducing a novel lower bound on the free energy, we then generalise our approach to Gaussian processes with arbitrary covariance, such as the non-Markovian RBF covariance. We present results on both simulated and real data, showing that the approach is very accurate in capturing latent dynamics and can be useful in a number of real data modelling tasks.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Manfred Opper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Opper:Manfred", "Andreas Ruttor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruttor:Andreas", "Guido Sanguinetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanguinetti:Guido"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
