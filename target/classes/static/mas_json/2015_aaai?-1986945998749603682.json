{"title": "Improving Exploration in UCT Using Local Manifolds.", "fields": ["graph", "metric", "manifold", "state space", "generalization"], "abstract": "Monte Carlo planning has been proven successful in many sequential decision-making settings, but it suffers from poor exploration when the rewards are sparse. In this paper, we improve exploration in UCT by generalizing across similar states using a given distance metric. When the state space does not have a natural distance metric, we show how we can learn a local manifold from the transition graph of states in the near future. to obtain a distance metric. On domains inspired by video games, empirical evidence shows that our algorithm is more sample efficient than UCT, particularly when rewards are sparse.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "Franklin and Marshal College"], "authors": ["Sriram Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Sriram", "Erik Talvitie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talvitie:Erik", "Michael H.
