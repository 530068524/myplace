The proposed framework consists of three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent space representation. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is also proposed in which the self-expressiveness layer corresponding to different modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art multimodal subspace clustering methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": [], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Pan Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Pan", "Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Tong", "Hongdong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongdong", "Mathieu Salzmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salzmann:Mathieu", "Ian D.
