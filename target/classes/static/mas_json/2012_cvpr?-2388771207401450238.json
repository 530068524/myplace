In their approach, a simple kNN scheme with multiple descriptor types is used to classify super-pixels. We add two novel mechanisms: (i) a principled and efficient method for learning per-descriptor weights that minimizes classification error, and (ii) a context-driven adaptation of the training set used for each query, which conditions on common classes (which are relatively easy to classify) to improve performance on rare ones. The first technique helps to remove extraneous descriptors that result from the imperfect distance metrics/representations of each super-pixel. The second contribution re-balances the class frequencies, away from the highly-skewed distribution found in real-world scenes. Both methods give a significant performance boost over [22] and the overall system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SIFT-Flow dataset.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["David Eigen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eigen:David", "Rob Fergus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fergus:Rob"], "pages": 8}
