In this paper, we examine the uneven functions of these media technologies in meeting the learning needs of online game players. StarCraft is an online game and electronic sport where millions around the world compete in virtual battlegrounds. To become better players, gamers actively share strategies in online forums, wiki, videos, and in person. We conducted participant observation of a StarCraft community known as Teamliquid. We performed 24 in-depth interviews with professional gamers, editors, game commentators, and community leaders. We found that the novice learners generally learned from, and participated in, public media channels, whereas the StarCraft experts congregated in small teams in which members learn from each other within private media channels and in person. We use the concepts of  informational media  and  socially-oriented media  to describe the general learning needs supported by media technologies.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Yong Ming Kow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kow:Yong_Ming", "Timothy Young.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Young:Timothy"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
