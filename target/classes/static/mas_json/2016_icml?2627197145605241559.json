{"title": "Simultaneous Safe Screening of Features and Samples in Doubly Sparse Modeling.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The problem of learning a sparse model is conceptually interpreted as the process of identifying active features/samples and then optimizing the model over them. Recently introduced safe screening allows us to identify a part of nonactive features/samples. So far, safe screening has been individually studied either for feature screening or for sample screening. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for safely screening features and samples simultaneously by alternatively iterating feature and sample screening steps. A significant advantage of considering them simultaneously rather than individually is that they have a synergy effect in the sense that the results of the previous safe feature screening can be exploited for improving the next safe sample screening performances, and vice-versa. We first theoretically investigate the synergy effect, and then illustrate the practical advantage through intensive numerical experiments for problems with large numbers of features and samples.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Kyushu University", "Nagoya Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Atsushi Shibagaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shibagaki:Atsushi", "Masayuki Karasuyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karasuyama:Masayuki", "Kohei Hatano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hatano:Kohei", "Ichiro Takeuchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takeuchi:Ichiro"], "pages": 10}
