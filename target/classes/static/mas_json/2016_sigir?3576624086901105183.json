{"title": "An Architecture for Privacy-Preserving and Replicable High-Recall Retrieval Experiments.", "fields": ["data mining", "recall", "information retrieval", "architecture", "virtual machine"], "abstract": "We demonstrate the infrastructure used in the TREC 2015 Total Recall track to facilitate controlled simulation of \"assessor in the loop\" high-recall retrieval experimentation. The implementation and corresponding design decisions are presented for this platform. This includes the necessary considerations to ensure that experiments are privacy-preserving when using test collections that cannot be distributed. Furthermore, we describe the use of virtual machines as a means of system submission in order to to promote replicable experiments while also ensuring the security of system developers and data providers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Adam Roegiest.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roegiest:Adam", "Gordon V.
