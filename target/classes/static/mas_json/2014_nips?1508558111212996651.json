Existing models usually assume simple inter-dependence among variables, space, and time, and are computationally expensive. We propose a unified low rank tensor learning framework for multivariate spatio-temporal analysis, which can conveniently incorporate different properties in spatio-temporal data, such as spatial clustering and shared structure among variables. We demonstrate how the general framework can be applied to cokriging and forecasting tasks, and develop an efficient greedy algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem with convergence guarantee. We conduct experiments on both synthetic datasets and real application datasets to demonstrate that our method is not only significantly faster than existing methods but also achieves lower estimation error.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Mohammad Taha Bahadori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bahadori:Mohammad_Taha", "Qi Rose Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Qi_Rose", "Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Yan"], "pages": 9}
