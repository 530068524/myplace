{"title": "SAGA: A Fast Incremental Gradient Method With Support for Non-Strongly Convex Composite Objectives.", "fields": ["operator", "regular polygon", "gradient method", "convex function", "convexity"], "abstract": "In this work we introduce a new optimisation method called SAGA in the spirit of SAG, SDCA, MISO and SVRG, a set of recently proposed incremental gradient algorithms with fast linear convergence rates. SAGA improves on the theory behind SAG and SVRG, with better theoretical convergence rates, and has support for composite objectives where a proximal operator is used on the regulariser. Unlike SDCA, SAGA supports non-strongly convex problems directly, and is adaptive to any inherent strong convexity of the problem. We give experimental results showing the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (527)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Australian National University", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Aaron Defazio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Defazio:Aaron", "Francis R.
