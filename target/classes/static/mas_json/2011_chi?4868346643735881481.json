In this paper, we first demonstrate the benefits of using touch as a complementary input modality along with the keyboard and mouse or touchpad in a laptop setting. To alleviate the frustration users experience with touch, we then design two techniques,  TouchCuts , a single target expansion technique, and ,i>TouchZoom,/i>, a multiple target expansion technique. Both techniques facilitate the selection of small icons, by detecting the finger proximity above the display surface, and expanding the target as the finger approaches. In a controlled evaluation, we show that our techniques improve performance in comparison to both the computer mouse and a baseline touch-based target acquisition technique. We conclude by discussing other application scenarios that our techniques support.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Autodesk", "University of Manitoba", "Autodesk"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Xing-Dong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xing=Dong", "Tovi Grossman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grossman:Tovi", "Pourang Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Pourang", "George W.
