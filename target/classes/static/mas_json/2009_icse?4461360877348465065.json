{"title": "JUnitMX - A change-aware unit testing tool.", "fields": ["test double", "black box testing", "software quality", "software system", "test strategy"], "abstract": "Developers use unit testing to improve the quality of software systems. Current development tools for unit testing help with automating test execution, with reporting results, and with generating test stubs. However, they offer no aid for designing tests aimed specifically at exercising the effects of changes to a program. This paper describes a unit testing tool that leverages a change model to assist developers in the creation of new unit tests. The tool provides developers with quantitative feedback and detailed information about change effects, which not only facilitate the writing of more effective tests, but also motivate developers with an achievable coverage goal.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Virginia Tech", "IBM"], "authors": ["Jan Wloka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wloka:Jan", "Barbara G.
