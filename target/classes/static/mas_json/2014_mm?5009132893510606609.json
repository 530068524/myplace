{"title": "Multimodal Alignment of Videos.", "fields": ["data synchronization", "synchronization", "crowds", "video processing", "benchmarking"], "abstract": "Most multimedia synchronization methods developed in the past are unimodal and consider only the audio data or the video data. Just recently, methods started to emerge that embrace multimodality by utilizing both audio and video processing to improve synchronization results. Although promising, their results are still not sufficient for fully automatic synchronization of recordings from heterogeneous sources. Video processing is also often too expensive to be used on large corpora of recordings, e.g. as they are commonly produced by crowds at social events. In my doctoral thesis, I will try to develop synchronization methods further by (a) examining fundamental problems that are usually ignored by lab-developed methods and therefore compromising real-world applications, (b) creating a publicly available synchronization-method benchmarking dataset, and (c) developing a low-level video feature based synchronization method with a computational complexity not higher than current state of the art audio-based methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt"], "authors": ["Mario Guggenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guggenberger:Mario"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
