Recent studies have begun shedding light on the processes contributing to Wikipedia's success, highlighting the role of coordination and contribution inequality. In this study, we expand on these works in two ways. First, we make a distinction between global (Wikipedia-wide) and local (article-specific) inequality and investigate both constructs. Second, we explore both direct and indirect effects of these inequalities, exposing the intricate relationships between global inequality, local inequality, coordination, and article quality. We tested our hypotheses on a sample of a Wikipedia articles using structural equation modeling and found that global inequality exerts significant positive impact on article quality, while the effect of local inequality is indirect and is mediated by coordination", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Polytechnic Ins ... w York, NY, USA"], "authors": ["Ofer Arazy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arazy:Ofer", "Oded Nov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nov:Oded"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
