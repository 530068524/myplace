{"title": "Tight bounds for single-pass streaming complexity of the set cover problem.", "fields": ["edge cover", "logarithm", "binary logarithm", "streaming algorithm", "vertex cover"], "abstract": "We resolve the space complexity of  single-pass  streaming algorithms for approximating the classic set cover problem. For finding an \u03b1-approximate set cover (for \u03b1=  o (\u221a n )) via a single-pass streaming algorithm, we show that \u0398( mn /\u03b1) space is both sufficient and necessary (up to an  O (log n ) factor); here  m  denotes number of the sets and  n  denotes size of the universe. This provides a strong negative answer to the open question posed by Indyk\u00a0(2015) regarding the possibility of having a single-pass algorithm with a small approximation factor that uses sub-linear space. We further study the problem of  estimating  the  size  of a minimum set cover (as opposed to finding the actual sets), and establish that an additional factor of \u03b1 saving in the space is achievable in this case and that this is the best possible. In other words, we show that \u0398( mn /\u03b1 2 ) space is both sufficient and necessary (up to logarithmic factors) for estimating the size of a minimum set cover to within a factor of \u03b1. Our algorithm in fact works for the more general problem of estimating the optimal value of a  covering integer program . On the other hand, our lower bound holds even for set cover instances where the sets are presented in a  random order .", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Sepehr Assadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Assadi:Sepehr", "Sanjeev Khanna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khanna:Sanjeev", "Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0025:Yang"], "pages": 14}
