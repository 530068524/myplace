{"title": "Synthesis of Asynchronous Reactive Programs from Temporal Specifications.", "fields": ["computer science", "asynchronous communication", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Asynchronous interactions are ubiquitous in computing systems and complicate design and programming. Automatic construction of asynchronous programs from specifications (\u201csynthesis\u201d) could ease the difficulty, but known methods are complex, and intractable in practice. This work develops substantially simpler synthesis methods. A direct, exponentially more compact automaton construction is formulated for the reduction of asynchronous to synchronous synthesis. Experiments with a prototype implementation of the new method demonstrate feasibility. Furthermore, it is shown that for several useful classes of temporal properties, automaton-based methods can be avoided altogether and replaced with simpler Boolean constraint solving.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Rice University", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Suguman Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Suguman", "Kedar S.
