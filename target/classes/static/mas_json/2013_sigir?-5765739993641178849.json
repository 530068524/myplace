{"title": "Self reinforcement for important passage retrieval.", "fields": ["machine learning", "automatic summarization", "noisy data", "reinforcement", "centrality"], "abstract": "In general, centrality-based retrieval models treat all elements of the retrieval space equally, which may reduce their effectiveness. In the specific context of extractive summarization (or important passage retrieval), this means that these models do not take into account that information sources often contain lateral issues, which are hardly as important as the description of the main topic, or are composed by mixtures of topics. We present a new two-stage method that starts by extracting a collection of key phrases that will be used to help centrality-as-relevance retrieval model. We explore several approaches to the integration of the key phrases in the centrality model. The proposed method is evaluated using different datasets that vary in noise (noisy vs clean) and language (Portuguese vs English). Results show that the best variant achieves relative performance improvements of about 31% in clean data and 18% in noisy data.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["INESC-ID", "INESC-ID", "INESC-ID", "INESC-ID", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Ricardo Ribeiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ribeiro_0001:Ricardo", "Lu\u00eds Marujo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marujo:Lu=iacute=s", "David Martins de Matos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matos:David_Martins_de", "Jo\u00e3o Paulo Neto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neto:Jo=atilde=o_Paulo", "Anatole Gershman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gershman:Anatole", "Jaime G.
