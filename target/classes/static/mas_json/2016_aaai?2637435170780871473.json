In this paper, we propose a human parsing pipeline that uses pose cues, i.e., estimates of human joint locations, to provide pose-guided segment proposals for semantic parts. These segment proposals are ranked using standard appearance cues, deep-learned semantic feature, and a novel pose feature called pose-context. Then these proposals are selected and assembled using an And-Or graph to output a parse of the person. The And-Or graph is able to deal with large human appearance variability due to pose, choice of clothes, etc. We evaluate our approach on the popular Penn-Fudan pedestrian parsing dataset, showing that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts, and perform diagnostics to demonstrate the effectiveness of different stages of our pipeline.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Fangting Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Fangting", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jun", "Peng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Peng", "Alan L.
