We propose an approach to automate this aspect of web development by generating reusable web components from a mockup. Our approach employs visual analysis of the mockup, and unsupervised learning of visual cues to create reusable web components (e.g., React components). We evaluated our approach, implemented in a tool called VizMod, on five real-world web mockups, and assessed the transformations and generated components through comparison with web development experts. The results show that VizMod achieves on average 94% precision and 75% recall in terms of agreement with the developers' assessment. Furthermore, the refactorings yielded 22% code reusability, on average.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Mohammad Bajammal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bajammal:Mohammad", "Davood Mazinanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazinanian:Davood", "Ali Mesbah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mesbah_0001:Ali"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
