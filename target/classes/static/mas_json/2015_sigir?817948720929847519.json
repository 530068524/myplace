{"title": "Bringing Order to the Job Market: Efficient Job Offer Categorization in E-Recruitment.", "fields": ["operator", "job analysis", "categorization", "e recruitment", "data mining"], "abstract": "E-recruitment uses a range of web-based technologies to find, evaluate, and hire new personnel for organizations. A crucial challenge in this arena lies in the categorization of job offers: candidates and operators often explore and analyze large numbers of offers and profiles through a set of job categories. To date, recruitment organizations define job categories top-down, relying on standardized vocabularies that often fail to capture new skills and requirements that emerge from dynamic labor markets. In order to support e-recruitment, this paper presents a dynamic, bottom-up method to automatically enrich and revise job categories. The method detects novel, highly characterizing terms in a corpus of job offers, leading to a more effective categorization, and is evaluated on real-world data by Multiposting (http://www.multiposting.fr/en), a large French e-recruitment firm.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "Multiposting, Paris, France"], "authors": ["Emmanuel Malherbe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malherbe:Emmanuel", "Mario Cataldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cataldi:Mario", "Andrea Ballatore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ballatore:Andrea"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
