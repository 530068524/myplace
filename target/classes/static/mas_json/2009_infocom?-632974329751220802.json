The difficulty arises because voice and best-effort data are different by nature. It would not be fair to give priority to voice traffic and starve its best-effort counterpart; however, the voice data delivered might not be perceptible if each voice call is limited to the rate of an average TCP flow. To address the problem, we approach it from a user-centric perspective by tuning the voice data rate based on user satisfaction. Our contribution in this work is threefold. First, we investigate how Skype, the largest and fastest growing VoIP service on the Internet, adapts its voice data rate (i.e., the redundancy ratio) to network conditions. Second, by exploiting implementations of public domain codecs, we discover that Skype's mechanism is not really geared to user satisfaction. Third, based on a set of systematic experiments that quantify user satisfaction under different levels of packet loss and burstiness, we derive a concise model that allows user-centric redundancy control. The model can be easily incorporated into general VoIP services (not only Skype) to ensure consistent user satisfaction.
