Previous results have shown that topology-hiding computation protocols exist for graphs of constant degree and logarithmic diameter in the number of nodes [Moran-Orlov-Richelson, TCC\u201915; Hirt et al., Crypto\u201916] as well as for other graph families, such as cycles, trees, and low circumference graphs [Akavia-Moran, Eurocrypt\u201917], but the feasibility question for general graphs was open.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya", "The Academic Co ...
