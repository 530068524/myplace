Using a series of examples including painting, mixed-media art and contemporary participatory works this paper explores three of these themes: landscape, critical spatialities and participation. Two different, although often entwined methodological approaches are set out, \u2018dialogues\u2019 whereby geographers interpret and analyse art works, and \u2018doings\u2019 in which geographers become exhibition curators, collaborate with artists and even become creative practitioners in their own right. During its course the paper considers the potential of the geographical study of art works to contribute to contemporary disciplinary debates around embodied experience, practice and more-than-human worlds. The paper also points towards a series of resources to help guide further study.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Uppsala University", "Uppsala University", "Stockholm University", "Uppsala University", "Deutsche Telekom", "Deutsche Telekom", "Deutsche Telekom", "Deutsche Telekom", "Deutsche Telekom", "Trinity Western University", "Trinity Western University", "Trinity Western University", "Trinity Western University", "Trinity Western University", "Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen", "codemacher UG, Germany", "Choreographer,  ... nhagen, Denmark"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Elena M\u00e1rquez Segura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segura:Elena_M=aacute=rquez", "Laia Turmo Vidal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidal:Laia_Turmo", "Asreen Rostami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rostami:Asreen", "Annika Waern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waern:Annika"], "pages": 14}
