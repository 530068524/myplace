A particular problem in this context is to identify routes that can easily be described and processed by users. In this work, we present a framework for representing route networks with the qualitative information necessary to evaluate and optimize route descriptions with regard to ambiguities in them. We identify different agent models that differ in how agents are assumed to process route descriptions while navigating through route networks. Further, we analyze the computational complexity of matching route descriptions and paths in route networks in dependency of the agent model. Finally we empirically evaluate the influence of the agent model on the optimization and the processing of route instructions.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "Australian National University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Matthias Westphal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Westphal:Matthias", "Stefan W\u00f6lfl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/W=ouml=lfl_0001:Stefan", "Bernhard Nebel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nebel:Bernhard", "Jochen Renz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Renz:Jochen"], "pages": 6}
