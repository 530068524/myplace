This is the first proof of security for any scheme in this model that does not rely on the assumed existence of so-called quantum-secure pseudorandom functions (PRFs). Our techniques are quite general and we use them to obtain security proofs for two random oracle hierarchical IBE schemes and a random oracle signature scheme, all of which have previously resisted quantum security proofs, even assuming quantum-secure PRFs. We also explain how to remove quantum-secure PRFs from prior quantum random oracle model proofs. We accomplish these results by developing new tools for arguing that quantum algorithms cannot distinguish between two oracle distributions. Using a particular class of oracle distributions that we call semi-constant distributions, we argue that the aforementioned cryptosystems are secure against quantum adversaries.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Stanford University"], "authors": ["Mark Zhandry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhandry:Mark"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 18}
