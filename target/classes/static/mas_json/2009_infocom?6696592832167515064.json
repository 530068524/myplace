{"title": "Minimizing Rulesets for TCAM Implementation.", "fields": ["sort", "content addressable memory", "access control list", "networking hardware", "ternary operation"], "abstract": "Packet classification is a function increasingly used in a number of networking appliances and applications. Typically, this consists of a set of abstract classifications, and a set of rules which sort packets into the various classifications. For packet classification at line speeds, Ternary Content-Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have become a norm in most networking hardware. However, TCAMs are expensive and power-hungry. Hence, a packet classification ruleset need to be minimized before populating the TCAM. In this paper, we formulate the Ruleset Minimization Problem for TCAM as an abstract optimization problem based on two-level logic minimization, and propose an exact solution and a number of heuristics. We present experimental results with two different datasets-artificial filter sets generated using ClassBench tool suite and a real firewall Access Control List (ACL) from a large enterprise. We observe an average reduction of 41% in artificial filter sets and 72.5% reduction in the firewall ACL using the proposed heuristics.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Rick McGeer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGeer:Rick", "Praveen Yalagandula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yalagandula:Praveen"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
