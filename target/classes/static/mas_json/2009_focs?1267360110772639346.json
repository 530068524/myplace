Instead of assuming independence of the variables we use a slightly weaker condition, namely bounds on the co-moments. This inequality allows us to simplify and strengthen several known direct-product theorems and establish new threshold direct-product theorems. Threshold direct-product theorems are statements of the following form: If one instance of a problem can be solved with probability at most p, then solving significantly more than a p-fraction among multiple instances has negligible probability. Results of this kind are crucial when distinguishing whether a process succeeds with probability s or c, for 0 \u226a s \u226a c \u226a 1. Here standard direct-product theorems are of no help since even a process which can solve one instance with probability c will only be able to solve all k instances withe exponentially small probability.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Falk Unger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unger:Falk"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
