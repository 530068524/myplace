Our analysis of user behavior and interviews presents the case that professionals use internal social networking to build stronger bonds with their weak ties and to reach out to employees they do not know. Their motivations in doing this include connecting on a personal level with coworkers, advancing their career with the company, and campaigning for their projects.", "citation": "Citations (826)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Joan Morris DiMicco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DiMicco:Joan_Morris", "David R.
