We argue that not all use is the same; while some behaviors are governed by conscious motivations, others may be a habitual response that is developed out of routine. We take a more granular approach to explaining what people are doing in online communities and how motivations and habits explain their use of specific features. In the context of the peer-production community Everything2 we employ both server log data and self-report, finding that habit is a non-conscious-driven behavior that is more associated with less cognitively-demanding tasks than content production.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Donghee Yvette Wohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wohn:Donghee_Yvette", "Alcides Velasquez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Velasquez:Alcides", "Torger Bjornrud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bjornrud:Torger", "Cliff Lampe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lampe:Cliff"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
