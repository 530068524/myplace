Our lower bounds improve on the best previous bounds in each of these models, and are the best possible for any function up to constant factors in the exponent. Moreover, we give one unified proof that is short and fairly elementary.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Toniann Pitassi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitassi:Toniann", "Robert Robere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robere:Robert"], "pages": 10}
