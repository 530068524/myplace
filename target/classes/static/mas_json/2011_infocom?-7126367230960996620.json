Specifically, we propose a cross-layer resource allocation mechanism to minimize the total transmit power in the network to achieve a target throughput. The problem in its original form is a NP-hard mixed integer program. We alleviate this problem with a greedy power and subcarrier allocation algorithm that is combined with a node selection strategy that is enabled by RNC, which we refer to as \u201cmin-cut chasing.\u201d We compare it with a reference algorithm that assigns subcarriers independently based on the max-min fairness criterion followed by optimal power allocation. Our results reveal that the proposed greedy algorithm with min-cut chasing, which is of polynomial complexity, yields power savings of 3dB and is within 1dB of a lower bound based on an interference-free assumption.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Dan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0010:Dan", "Narayan B.
