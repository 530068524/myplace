{"title": "PrETP: Privacy-Preserving Electronic Toll Pricing.", "fields": ["implementation", "cryptographic protocol", "audit", "microcontroller", "payment"], "abstract": "Current Electronic Toll Pricing (ETP) implementations rely on on-board units sending fine-grained location data to the service provider. We present PrETP, a privacy-preserving ETP system in which on-board units can prove that they use genuine data and perform correct operations while disclosing the minimum amount of location data. PrETP employs a cryptographic protocol, Optimistic Payment, which we define in the ideal-world/real-world paradigm, construct, and prove secure under standard assumptions. We provide an efficient implementation of this construction and build an on-board unit on an embedded microcontroller which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first self-contained prototype that supports remote auditing. We thoroughly analyze our system from a security, legal and performance perspective and demonstrate that PrETP is suitable for low-cost commercial applications.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Josep Balasch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balasch:Josep", "Alfredo Rial.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rial:Alfredo", "Carmela Troncoso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Troncoso:Carmela", "Bart Preneel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Preneel:Bart", "Ingrid Verbauwhede.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verbauwhede:Ingrid", "Christophe Geuens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geuens:Christophe"], "pages": 16}
