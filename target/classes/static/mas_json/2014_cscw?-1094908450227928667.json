Existing information systems (IS) tend to treat these different aspects of coordination separately, resulting in problems of awareness and coordination. To bridge this gap, we present the concept of Articulation Spaces which combines aspects of Coordination Mechanisms and Common Information Spaces (CIS) in order to provide a room for mediating between the formal and informal aspects of coordination. Based on a design study in the form of a lightweight public display that has been tested in a medium-sized German software company, we show how Articulation Spaces provide information for meta-coordination, encourage ad-hoc coordination and support decision-making processes. Our findings provide insights into the design of support systems for flexible and coordination-intensive contexts such as software development work.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Siegen"], "authors": ["Alexander Boden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boden:Alexander", "Frank Ro\u00dfwog.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ro=szlig=wog:Frank", "Gunnar Stevens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stevens:Gunnar", "Volker Wulf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulf:Volker"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
