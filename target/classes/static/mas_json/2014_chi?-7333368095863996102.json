A collaborative game designed on a system that integrates multiple mobile devices with an interactive tabletop was presented to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed MOY framework. Observations from field trials involving two groups of children were used to summarize the collaborative behaviors that are likely to be observed under the different interaction design configurations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Wooi-Boon Goh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goh:Wooi=Boon", "Ming Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ming", "Cuong Hong Trinh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trinh:Cuong_Hong", "Jacquelyn Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Jacquelyn", "Wei Shou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shou:Wei"], "pages": 10}
