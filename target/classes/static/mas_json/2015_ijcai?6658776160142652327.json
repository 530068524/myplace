{"title": "Reduced Time-Expansion Graphs and Goal Decomposition for Solving Cooperative Path Finding Sub-Optimally.", "fields": ["job shop scheduling", "collision", "mathematical optimization", "satisfiability", "graph"], "abstract": "Solving cooperative path finding (CPF) by translating it to propositional satisfiability represents a viable option in highly constrained situations. The task in CPF is to relocate agents from their initial positions to given goals in a collision free manner. In this paper, we propose a reduced time expansion that is focused on makespan sub-optimal solving. The suggested reduced time expansion is especially beneficial in conjunction with a goal decomposition where agents are relocated one by one.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Charles University in Prague"], "authors": ["Pavel Surynek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Surynek:Pavel"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
