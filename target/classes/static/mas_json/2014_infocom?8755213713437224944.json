Assuming infinite backlog, it is known that inter-session network coding (INC) can significantly increase the throughput of each flow. However, the corresponding scheduling solution (assuming dynamic arrivals and requiring bounded delay) is still nascent. For the 2-flow downlink scenario, we propose the first op- portunistic INC + scheduling solution that is provably optimal for time-varying channels, i.e., the corresponding stability region matches the optimal linear-INC capacity. To that end, we first in- troduce a new binary INC operation, which is distinctly different from the traditional wisdom of XORing two overheard packets. We then develop a queue-length-based scheduling scheme, which, with the help of the new INC operation, can robustly and opti- mally adapt to time-varying channel quality. A byproduct of our results is a scheduling scheme for stochastic processing networks (SPNs) with random departure. The new SPN results relax the previous assumption of deterministic departure, a major limitation of the existing SPN model, by considering stochastic packet departure behavior, and could further broaden the applications of SPN scheduling to other real-world scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Wei-Cheng Kuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuo:Wei=Cheng", "Chih-Chun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chih=Chun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
