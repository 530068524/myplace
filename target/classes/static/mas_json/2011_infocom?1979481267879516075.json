{"title": "FEACAN: Front-end acceleration for content-aware network processing.", "fields": ["front and back ends", "hardware acceleration", "deep packet inspection", "electronic system level design and verification", "low latency"], "abstract": "Modern networks are increasingly becoming content aware to improve data delivery and security via content-based network processing. Content-aware processing at the front end of distributed network systems, such as application identification for datacenter load-balancers and deep packet inspection for security gateways, is more challenging due to the wire-speed and low-latency requirement. Existing work focuses on algorithm-level solutions while lacking system-level design to meet the critical requirement for front-end content processing. In this paper, we propose a system-level solution named FEACAN for front-end acceleration of content-aware network processing. FEACAN employs a software-hardware co-design supporting both signature matching and regular expression matching for content-aware network processing. A two-dimensional DFA compression algorithm is designed to reduce the memory usage and a hardware lookup engine is proposed for high-performance lookup. Experimental results show that FEACAN achieves better performance than existing work in terms of processing speed, resource utilization, and update time.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yaxuan Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Yaxuan", "Kai Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Kai", "Jeffrey Fong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fong:Jeffrey", "Yibo Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Yibo", "Jun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Jun", "Weirong Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Weirong", "Viktor K.
