In our setting each test and training example is a set of images of an individual's face, not just a single image, so recognition decisions need to be based on comparisons of image sets. Methods for this have two main aspects: the models used to represent the individual image sets; and the similarity metric used to compare the models. Here, we represent images as points in a linear or affine feature space and characterize each image set by a convex geometric region (the affine or convex hull) spanned by its feature points. Set dissimilarity is measured by geometric distances (distances of closest approach) between convex models. To reduce the influence of outliers we use robust methods to discard input points that are far from the fitted model. The kernel trick allows the approach to be extended to implicit feature mappings, thus handling complex and nonlinear manifolds of face images. Experiments on two public face datasets show that our proposed methods outperform a number of existing state-of-the-art ones.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Eski\u015fehir Osmangazi University", "Laboratoire Jea ...
