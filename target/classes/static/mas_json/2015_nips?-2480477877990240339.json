However, the problem of finding an optimal trade-off between exploration and exploitation (otherwise known as the bandit problem), a crucial problem in collaborative filtering from cold-start, has not been previously addressed. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for online MF recommendation that automatically combines finding the most relevant items with exploring new or less-recommended items. Our approach, called Particle Thompson sampling for MF (PTS), is based on the general Thompson sampling framework, but augmented with a novel efficient online Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization method based on the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. Extensive experiments in collaborative filtering using several real-world datasets demonstrate that PTS significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-arts.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "University of Southampton", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jaya Kawale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawale:Jaya", "Hung Hai Bui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bui:Hung_Hai", "Branislav Kveton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kveton:Branislav", "Long Tran-Thanh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran=Thanh:Long", "Sanjay Chawla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chawla:Sanjay"], "pages": 9}
