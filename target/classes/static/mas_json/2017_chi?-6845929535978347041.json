{"title": "Gains from Participatory Design Team Membership as Perceived by Child Alumni and their Parents.", "fields": ["interview", "co design", "design process", "applied psychology", "participatory design"], "abstract": "The direct gains children perceive from their membership on Participatory Design (PD) teams are seldom the focus of research studies. Yet, how HCI practitioners choose to include children in PD methods may influence the value participants see in their participation, and thereafter the outcomes of PD processes. To understand what gains former child members of a PD team perceive from their participation we conducted a two-part study. In Study 1 we surveyed and interviewed child alumni of a PD team to determine gains that are perceived first-hand. In Study 2 we obtained a secondary perspective by surveying and interviewing parents of alumni. We report on the perceived gains to former participants that were identified and described in these two studies-including collaboration, communication, design process knowledge, and confidence. We reflect on our findings through discussions of the continued applicability of gains, new opportunities, and implications for PD practitioners and methods.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Brenna McNally.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McNally:Brenna", "Matthew Louis Mauriello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mauriello:Matthew_Louis", "Mona Leigh Guha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guha:Mona_Leigh", "Allison Druin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Druin:Allison"], "pages": 12}
