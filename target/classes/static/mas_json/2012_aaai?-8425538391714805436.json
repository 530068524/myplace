{"title": "Trap Avoidance in Local Search Using Pseudo-Conflict Learning.", "fields": ["incremental heuristic search", "iterated local search", "guided local search", "beam search", "novelty"], "abstract": "A key challenge in developing efficient local search solvers is to effectively minimise search stagnation (i. e. avoiding traps or local minima). A majority of the state-of-the-art local search solvers perform random and/or Novelty-based walks to overcome search stagnation. Although such strategies are effective in diversifying a search from its current local minimum, they do not actively prevent the search from visiting previously encountered local minima. In this paper, we propose a new preventative strategy to effectively minimise search stagnation using pseudo-conflict learning. We define a pseudo-conflict as a derived path from the search trajectory that leads to a local minimum. We then introduce a new variable selection scheme that penalises variables causing those pseudo-conflicts. Our experimental results show that the new preventative approach significantly improves the performance of local search solvers on a wide range of structured and random benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Griffith University", "Griffith University", "Griffith University"], "authors": ["Duc Nghia Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Duc_Nghia", "Thach-Thao Duong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duong:Thach=Thao", "Abdul Sattar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sattar_0001:Abdul"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
