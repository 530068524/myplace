Tebaldi partitions conflicts at a fine granularity and matches them to specialized CCs within a hierarchical framework that is modular, extensible, and able to support a wide variety of concurrency control techniques, from single-version to multiversion and from lock-based to timestamp-based. When running the TPC-C benchmark, Tebaldi yields more than 20\u00d7 the throughput of the basic two-phase locking protocol, and over 3.7\u00d7 the throughput of Callas, a recent system that, like Tebaldi, aims to combine different CCs.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Cornell University", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Chunzhi Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Chunzhi", "Natacha Crooks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crooks:Natacha", "Cong Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Cong", "Lorenzo Alvisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alvisi:Lorenzo", "Chao Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Chao"], "pages": 15}
