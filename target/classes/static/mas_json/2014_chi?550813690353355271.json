Moreover, preschool children are incessantly inquisitive, and will readily engage in question answering and asking activities if given the opportunity. We argue here that question asking/answering technologies can play a major role in early literacy. We describe the design and evaluation of a conversational agent called Spot, with the goal of engaging children in a 20-questions game. Towards this goal, we conducted a feasibility study to determine if children's questions are \"on-topic\" and suitable for ASR/dialogue systems. We evaluated Spot's performance at conducting a game of 20-questions against that of a human partner.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Anuj Tewari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tewari:Anuj", "John F.
