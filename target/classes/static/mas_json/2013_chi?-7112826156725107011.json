{"title": "Improving teamwork using real-time language feedback.", "fields": ["discussion group", "teamwork", "peer feedback", "simulation", "computer supported cooperative work"], "abstract": "We develop and evaluate a real-time language feedback system that monitors the communication patterns among students in a discussion group and provides real-time instructions to shape the way the group works together. As an initial step, we determine which group processes are related to better outcomes. We then experimentally test the efficacy of providing real-time instructions which target two of these group processes. The feedback system was successfully able to shape the way groups worked together. However, only appropriate feedback given to groups that were not working well together from the start was able to improve group performance.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Yla R.
