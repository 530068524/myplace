Previous studies on negation and speculation identification in Chinese language suffers much from two problems: corpus scarcity and the bottleneck in fundamental Chinese information processing. To resolve these problems, this paper constructs a Chinese corpus which consists of three sub-corpora from different resources. In order to detect the negative and speculative cues, a sequence labeling model is proposed. Moreover, a bilingual cue expansion method is proposed to increase the coverage in cue detection. In addition, this paper presents a new syntactic structure-based framework to identify the linguistic scope of a cue, instead of the traditional chunking-based framework. Experimental results justify the usefulness of our Chinese corpus and the appropriateness of our syntactic structure-based framework which obtained significant improvement over the stateof-the-art on negation and speculation identification in Chinese language. *", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Soochow University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Bowei Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou:Bowei", "Qiaoming Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Qiaoming", "Guodong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guodong"], "pages": 10}
