{"title": "Comparing Variants of Strategic Ability.", "fields": ["perfect information", "artificial intelligence", "computer science", "semantics", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We show that different semantics of ability in ATL give rise to different validity sets. As a consequence, different notions of ability induce different strategic logics and different general properties of games. Moreover, the study can be seen as the first systematic step towards satisfiability-checking algorithms for ATL with imperfect information.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "Clausthal University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Wojciech Jamroga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jamroga:Wojciech", "Nils Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Nils"], "pages": 6}
