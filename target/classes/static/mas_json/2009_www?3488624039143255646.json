{"title": "Rapid prototyping of semantic mash-ups through semantic web pipes.", "fields": ["semantic web rule language", "cwm", "social semantic web", "semantic analytics", "semantic grid"], "abstract": "The use of RDF data published on the Web for applications is still a cumbersome and resource-intensive task due to the limited software support and the lack of standard programming paradigms to deal with everyday problems such as combination of RDF data from dierent sources, object identifier consolidation, ontology alignment and mediation, or plain querying and filtering tasks. In this paper we present a framework, Semantic Web Pipes, that supports fast implementation of Semantic data mash-ups while preserving desirable properties such as abstraction, encapsulation, component-orientation, code re-usability and maintainability which are common and well supported in other application areas.", "citation": "Citations (162)", "departments": ["National University of Ireland, Galway", "National University of Ireland, Galway", "National University of Ireland, Galway", "National University of Ireland, Galway", "Marche Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Danh Le Phuoc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phuoc:Danh_Le", "Axel Polleres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polleres:Axel", "Manfred Hauswirth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hauswirth:Manfred", "Giovanni Tummarello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tummarello:Giovanni", "Christian Morbidoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morbidoni:Christian"], "conf": "www", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
