{"title": "Poly-logarithmic Frege depth lower bounds via an expander switching lemma.", "fields": ["logarithm", "lemma", "binary logarithm", "expander graph", "contradiction"], "abstract": "We show that any polynomial-size Frege refutation of a certain linear-size unsatisfiable 3-CNF formula over  n  variables must have depth \u03a9(\u221alog n ). This is an exponential improvement over the previous best results (Pitassi et al.\u00a01993, Krajicek et al.\u00a01995, Ben-Sasson 2002) which give \u03a9(loglog n ) lower bounds.   The 3-CNF formulas which we use to establish this result are Tseitin contradictions on 3-regular expander graphs. In more detail, our main result is a proof that for every  d , any depth- d  Frege refutation of the Tseitin contradiction over these  n -node graphs must have size  n  \u03a9((log n )/ d  2 ) . A key ingredient of our approach is a new switching lemma for a carefully designed random restriction process over these expanders. These random restrictions reduce a Tseitin instance on a 3-regular  n -node expander to a Tseitin instance on a random subgraph which is a topological embedding of a 3-regular  n \u2032-node expander, for some  n \u2032 which is not too much less than  n . Our result involves \u03a9(\u221alog n ) iterative applications of this type of random restriction.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "National Institute of Informatics", "Columbia University", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Toniann Pitassi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitassi:Toniann", "Benjamin Rossman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossman:Benjamin", "Rocco A.
