{"title": "Mirror Mirror: An On-Body T-shirt Design System.", "fields": ["augmented reality", "computer graphics images", "multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "Virtual fitting rooms equipped with magic mirrors let people evaluate fashion items without actually putting them on. The mirrors superimpose virtual clothes on the user's reflection. We contribute the Mirror Mirror system, which not only supports mixing and matching of existing fashion items, but also lets users design new items in front of the mirror and export designs to fabric printers. While much of the related work deals with interactive cloth simulation on live user data, we focus on collaborative design activities and explore various ways of designing on the body with a mirror.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Daniel Saakes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saakes:Daniel", "Hui-Shyong Yeo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeo:Hui=Shyong", "Seungtak Noh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noh:Seungtak", "Gyeol Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Gyeol", "Woontack Woo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woo:Woontack"], "pages": 6}
