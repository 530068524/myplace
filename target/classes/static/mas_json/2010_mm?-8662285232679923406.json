We deploy these vectors to improve spoken-content-based video retrieval using Query Expansion Selection (QES). Our QES approach analyzes results lists returned in response to several alternative query expansions, applying a coherence indicator calculated on top-ranked items to choose the appropriate expansion. The approach is data driven, does not require prior training and relies solely on the analysis of the collection being queried and the results lists produced for the given query text. The experiments, performed on two datasets, TRECVID 2007/2008 and TRECVID 2009, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that a small set of well-selected visual concept detectors is sufficient to improve retrieval performance.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Stevan Rudinac.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rudinac:Stevan", "Martha Larson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larson:Martha", "Alan Hanjalic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanjalic:Alan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
