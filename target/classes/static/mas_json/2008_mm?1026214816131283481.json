{"title": "MobiToss: a novel gesture based interface for creating and sharing mobile multimedia art on large public displays.", "fields": ["phone", "mobile phone", "upload", "gesture", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "This paper presents MobiToss, a novel application for creating and sharing mobile multimedia art with an off-the-shelf mobile phone equipped with built-in accelerometer sensors allowing gesture control. The user first takes a photo or captures a video with the phone and then using a 'throwing' gesture transfers the clip onto a large public display for instant viewing and manipulation by tilting the phone in different directions. The system augments the user-created clip with other items such as music or brand labels and the encoded clip is automatically sent back to the phone as a personal artefact of the event. The clip is also uploaded to a dedicated community website for sharing the created multimedia art with others. MobiToss could be deployed e.g. in clubs, pubs and concerts as a participatory VJ-tool. In addition to the design the paper presents the results of a preliminary user evaluation, which highlight the novel art experience provided by MobiToss.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "Lancaster University", "University of A ... lsinki, Finland"], "authors": ["J\u00fcrgen Scheible.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scheible:J=uuml=rgen", "Timo Ojala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ojala:Timo", "Paul Coulton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coulton:Paul"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
