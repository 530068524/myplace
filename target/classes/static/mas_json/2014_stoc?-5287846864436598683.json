Formally, we consider both the additive and multiplicative versions of, what we call, the  regret-bounded vehicle routing problem  (RVRP). In these problems, we are given an undirected complete graph  G  = ({ r } \u222a  V,E ) on  n  nodes with a distinguished root (depot) node  r , edge costs { c   uv  } that form a metric, and a regret bound  R . Given a path  P  rooted at  r  and a node  v  \u2208  P , let  c   P  ( v ) be the distance from  r  to  v  along  P . The goal is to find the fewest number of paths rooted at  r  that cover all the nodes so that for every node  v  covered by (say) path  P : (i) its additive regret  c   P  ( v ) --  c   rv  , with respect to  P  is at most  R  in  additive - RVRP ; or (ii) its multiplicative regret,  c   P  ( v )/ c   rv  , with respect to  P  is at most  R  in  multiplicative -RVRP.   Our main result is the  first  constant-factor approximation algorithm for additive-RVRP. This is a substantial improvement over the previous-best  O (log  n )-approximation. Additive-RVRP turns out be a rather central vehicle-routing problem, whose study reveals insights into a variety of other regret-related problems as well as the classical  distance-constrained VRP  (DVRP), enabling us to obtain guarantees for these various problems by leveraging our algorithm for additive-RVRP and the underlying techniques. We obtain approximation ratios of [EQUATION] for multiplicative-RVRP, and [EQUATION] for DVRP with distance bound  D  via reductions to additive-RVRP; the latter improves upon the previous-best approximation for DVRP.   A noteworthy aspect of our results is that they are obtained by devising rounding techniques for a natural  configuration-style LP . This furthers our understanding of LP-relaxations for VRPs and enriches the toolkit of techniques that have been utilized for configuration LPs.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Univ.
