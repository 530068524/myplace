{"title": "Effective API recommendation without historical software repositories.", "fields": ["mean reciprocal rank", "statistical model", "discriminative model", "graph", "ranking"], "abstract": "It is time-consuming and labor-intensive to learn and locate the correct API for programming tasks. Thus, it is beneficial to perform API recommendation automatically. The graph-based statistical model has been shown to recommend top-10 API candidates effectively. It falls short, however, in accurately recommending an actual top-1 API. To address this weakness, we propose RecRank, an approach and tool that applies a novel ranking-based discriminative approach leveraging API usage path features to improve top-1 API recommendation. Empirical evaluation on a large corpus of (1385+8) open source projects shows that RecRank significantly improves top-1 API recommendation accuracy and mean reciprocal rank when compared to state-of-the-art API recommendation approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Southern Methodist University", "Southern Methodist University", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Xiaoyu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaoyu", "LiGuo Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:LiGuo", "Vincent Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Vincent"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
