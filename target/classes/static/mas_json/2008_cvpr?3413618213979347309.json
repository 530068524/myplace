This analysis is fundamental in two respects: First, it gives a deep insight into the basic mechanisms of image formation of defocused images, and second, it shows how to incorporate additional a-priori knowledge about the geometry and photometry of the scene in restoration algorithms. For instance, we show that the case of a scene made of a single surface results in a simple constraint in the Fourier domain. We derive two basic types of algorithms for volumetric reconstruction: One based on a dense set of defocused images, and one based on a sparse set of defocused images. While the first one excels in simplicity, the second one is of more practical use. Both algorithms are tested on real and synthetic data.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Heriot-Watt University", "Arivis Multiple ... ostock, Germany"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Paolo Favaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Favaro:Paolo", "Alessandro Duci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duci:Alessandro"], "pages": -1}
