The exact version of the problem was shown to be NP-complete in [14]. In [8], the gap version of the problem was shown to be NP-hard for any constant factor under a randomized reduction. It was shown in the same paper that the minimum distance problem is not approximable in randomized polynomial time to the factor 2 log 1-e  n  unless NP \u2286 RTIME(2 polylog(n) ). In this paper, we derandomize the reduction and thus prove that there is no deterministic polynomial time algorithm to approximate the minimum distance to any constant factor unless P=NP. We also prove that the minimum distance is not approximable in deterministic polynomial time to the factor 2 log 1-e n  unless NP \u2286 DTIME(2 polylog(n) ).
