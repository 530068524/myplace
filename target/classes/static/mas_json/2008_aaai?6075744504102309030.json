While there have been several proposals, including by Montague (1970), to give model theoretic semantics for natural language and to translate natural language sentences and discourses to classical logic, none of these approaches use knowledge representation languages that can express domain knowledge involving normative statements and exceptions. In this paper we take a first step to illustrate how one can automatically translate natural language sentences about normative statements and exceptions to representations in the knowledge representation language Answer Set Programming (ASP). To do this, we use \u03bb-calculus representation of words and their composition as dictated by a CCG grammar.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "New Mexico State University"], "authors": ["Chitta Baral.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baral:Chitta", "Juraj Dzifcak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dzifcak:Juraj", "Tran Cao Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:Tran_Cao"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
