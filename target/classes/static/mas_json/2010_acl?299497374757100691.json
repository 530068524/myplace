In this paper, we describe TrustRank, an MT system enhanced with a capability to rank the quality of translation outputs from good to bad. This enables the user to set a quality threshold, granting the user control over the quality of the translations.\n\nWe quantify the gains we obtain in translation quality, and show that our solution works on a wide variety of domains and language pairs.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Language Weaver ... os Angeles, CA", "Language Weaver ... os Angeles, CA"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Radu Soricut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soricut:Radu", "Abdessamad Echihabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Echihabi:Abdessamad"], "pages": 10}
