Our density estimate is a piecewise constant function defined on a binary partition of $\\Omega$. The key ingredient of the algorithm is to use discrepancy, a concept originates from Quasi Monte Carlo analysis, to control the partition process. The resulting algorithm is simple, efficient, and has provable convergence rate. We demonstrate empirically its efficiency as a density estimation method. We also show how it can be utilized to find good initializations for k-means.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Dangna Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dangna", "Kun Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Kun", "Wing Hung Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Wing_Hung"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
