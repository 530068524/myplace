Affine dispersers have been considered in the context of deterministic extraction of randomness from structured sources of imperfect randomness. Previously, explicit constructions of affine dispersers were known for every d = \u03a9(n), due to Barak et. al.[2] and Bourgain[10] (the latter in fact gives stronger objects called affine extractors). In this work we give the first explicit affine dispersers for  sublinear  dimension. Specifically, our dispersers work even when d = \u03a9(n 4/5 ). The main novelty in our construction lies in the method of proof, which relies on elementary properties of  subspace polynomials . In contrast, the previous works mentioned above relied on sum-product theorems for finite fields.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Eli Ben-Sasson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Sasson:Eli", "Swastik Kopparty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopparty:Swastik"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
