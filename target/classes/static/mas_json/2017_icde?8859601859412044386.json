A Storage Engine's Perspective.", "fields": ["research question", "workload", "data mining", "terminology", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Employing special-purpose processors (e.g., GPUs) in database systems has been studied throughout the last decade. Research on heterogeneous database systems that use both general-and special-purpose processors has addressed either transaction-or analytic processing, but not the combination of them. Support for hybrid transaction-and analytic processing (HTAP) has been studied exclusively for CPU-only systems. In this paper we ask the question whether current systems are ready for HTAP workload management with cooperating generaland special-purpose processors. For this, we take the perspective of the backbone of database systems: the storage engine. We propose a unified terminology and a comprehensive taxonomy to compare state-of-the-art engines from both domains. We show similarities and differences, and determine a necessary set of features for engines supporting HTAP workload on CPUs and GPUs. Answering our research question, our findings yield a resolute: not yet.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg", "Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg", "Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg", "Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg"], "authors": ["Marcus Pinnecke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinnecke:Marcus", "David Broneske.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broneske:David", "Gabriel Campero Durand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durand:Gabriel_Campero", "Gunter Saake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saake:Gunter"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
