However, providing such tool support is a huge investment that can usually not be provided for a research language. With FeatureIDE, we have built an IDE for AHEAD that integrates all phases of feature-oriented software development. To reuse this investment for other tools and languages, we refactored FeatureIDE into an open source framework that encapsulates the common ideas of feature-oriented software development and that can be reused and extended beyond AHEAD. Among others, we implemented extensions for FeatureC++ and FeatureHouse, but in general, FeatureIDE is open for everybody to showcase new research results and make them usable to a wide audience of students, researchers, and practitioners.", "citation": "Citations (205)", "departments": ["School of Compu ... deburg, Germany", "School of Compu ... deburg, Germany", "School of Compu ... deburg, Germany", "Section Applied ... deburg, Germany", "Section Applied ... deburg, Germany"], "authors": ["Christian K\u00e4stner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=auml=stner:Christian", "Thomas Th\u00fcm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Th=uuml=m:Thomas", "Gunter Saake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saake:Gunter", "Janet Feigenspan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feigenspan:Janet", "Thomas Leich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leich:Thomas", "Fabian Wielgorz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wielgorz:Fabian", "Sven Apel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apel:Sven"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
