Priority differentiation in such a network can be accomplished through different scheduling policies, differentiated duration of mandatory spectrum sensing, or a combination of the two. This differentiation will affect not only packet delays, but also the accuracy of channel sensing and, by extension, the probability of collisions with primary user transmissions which will critically affect the operation of the network. In this paper we provide a probabilistic analysis of the interplay between priority differentiation and network performance, and investigate the resulting tradeoffs under different prioritization approaches.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Ryerson University", "Ryerson University", "Ryerson University"], "authors": ["Jelena V.
