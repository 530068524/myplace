One of the approaches to sanitize network data is to randomly add or remove edges from the graph. Recent studies have quantified the level of anonymity that is obtained by random perturbation by means of a-posteriori belief probabilities and, by conducting experiments on small datasets, arrived at the conclusion that random perturbation can not achieve meaningful levels of anonymity without deteriorating the graph features.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Open University", "Yahoo!", "Aalto University", "Open University"], "authors": ["Francesco Bonchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonchi:Francesco", "Aristides Gionis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gionis:Aristides", "Tamir Tassa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tassa:Tamir"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
