The relationship between micro-level, situated actions and broader outcomes such as opportunities for learning is under-explored. We investigated co-located groups as they played a collaborative, problem-solving game using distributed technology on laptops. There was considerable variety in how groups accomplished the work. Some satisfied groups talked a lot but other satisfied groups did not. Talk was diagnostic of satisfaction but lack of talk was not diagnostic of dissatisfaction. In fact, groups that had little or no discourse differed considerably from one another. One kind of group completes the joint tasks very well without observable markers frequently associated with success. Others are less successful in the task goal but man-age difficult interpersonal situations.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Joon-Suk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joon=Suk", "Deborah G.
