This is a challenging problem because unlike unstructured prediction problems such as binary or multi-class classification, structured prediction problems involve a distribution with an exponentially-large support, for instance, over the space of all possible segmentations of an image. Thus, the entropy of such models is typically intractable to compute. We propose a crude yet surprisingly effective histogram approximation to the Gibbs distribution, which replaces the exponentially-large support with a coarsened distribution that may be viewed as a histogram over M bins. We show that our approach outperforms a number of baselines and results in a 90%-reduction in the number of annotations needed to achieve nearly the same accuracy as learning from the entire dataset.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Virginia Tech"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Qing Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Qing", "Ankit Laddha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laddha:Ankit", "Dhruv Batra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Batra:Dhruv"], "pages": 10}
