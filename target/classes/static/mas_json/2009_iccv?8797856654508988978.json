The core of this algorithm is based on the assumption that the deformation is continuous and predictable in a short temporal interval. While the camera can only capture part of a whole surface at any time instant, partial surfaces reconstructed from different times are assembled together to form a complete 3D surface for each time instant, even when the shape is under severe deformation. A mesh warping algorithm based on linear mesh deformation is used to align different partial surfaces. A volumetric method is then used to combine partial surfaces, fix missing holes, and smooth alignment errors. Our experiment shows that this approach is able to reconstruct visually plausible 3D surface deformation results with a single camera.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Kentucky", "University of Kentucky", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Kentucky", "Memorial University of Newfoundland"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Miao Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Miao", "Qing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qing", "Huamin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huamin", "Ruigang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ruigang", "Minglun Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Minglun"], "pages": 8}
