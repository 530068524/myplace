This framework, which is called CAROM (Context-Aware Routing over Ordered Meshes), uses regions of interest to identify connected componnets of the network that span sources and destinations of interest to restrict signaling to occur mostly within these regions. Context information is used to compute routing meshes composed of shortest-paths located inside of regions of interest. Experimental results based on extensive simulations show that CAROM attains similar or better data delivery and end-to-end delays than traditional unicast and multicast routing schemes for MANETs (AODV, OLSR, ODMRP), and that CAROM incurs only a fraction of the signaling overhead of traditional routing schemes.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Rolando Menchaca-M\u00e9ndez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Menchaca=M=eacute=ndez:Rolando", "J.
