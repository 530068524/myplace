This paper presents a novel intuitive interactive interface for browsing of large image collections that visualizes underlying structure of the dataset by its size and spatial relations. In order to achieve this, images are initially clustered using an unsupervised graph-based clustering algorithm. By selecting images in a hierarchical layout of the screen, user can intuitively navigate through the collection. The experimental results demonstrate a significant speed-up in a content search scenario compared to a standard browsing interface, as well as inherent intuitiveness of the system.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Surrey", "University of Surrey"], "authors": ["Kan Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Kan", "Janko Calic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calic:Janko"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
