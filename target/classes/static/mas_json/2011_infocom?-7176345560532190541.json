While this is not the first work on applying CS to count and localize targets, it is the first to rigorously justify the validity of the problem formulation. Moreover, we propose a novel greedy matching pursuit algorithm (GMP) that complements the well-known signal recovery algorithms in CS theory and prove that GMP can accurately recover a sparse signal with a high probability. We also propose a framework for counting and positioning targets from multiple categories, a novel problem that has never been addressed before. Finally, we perform a comprehensive set of simulations whose results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the existing CS and non-CS based techniques.", "citation": "Citations (173)", "departments": ["George Washington University", "George Washington University", "George Washington University", "Tsinghua University", "Georgia State University"], "authors": ["Bowu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Bowu", "Xiuzhen Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiuzhen", "Nan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Nan", "Yong Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui_0001:Yong", "Yingshu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yingshu", "Qilian Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Qilian"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
