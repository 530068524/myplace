However, the use of personal information in passwords and its security implications have not yet been studied systematically in the past. In this paper, we first dissect user passwords from a leaked dataset to investigate how and to what extent user personal information resides in a password. In particular, we extract the most popular password structures expressed by personal information and show the usage of personal information. Then we introduce a new metric called Coverage to quantify the correlation between passwords and personal information. Afterwards, based on our analysis, we extend the Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFG) method to be semantics-rich and propose Personal-PCFG to crack passwords by generating personalized guesses. Through offline and online attack scenarios, we demonstrate that Personal-PCFG cracks passwords much faster than PCFG and makes online attacks much easier to succeed.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "University of Delaware", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Yue Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0002:Yue", "Haining Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haining", "Kun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Kun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
