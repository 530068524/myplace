{"title": "Learning Image and User Features for Recommendation in Social Networks.", "fields": ["homogeneous", "recommender system", "online algorithm", "feature learning", "feature"], "abstract": "Good representations of data do help in many machine learning tasks such as recommendation. It is often a great challenge for traditional recommender systems to learn representative features of both users and images in large social networks, in particular, social curation networks, which are characterized as the extremely sparse links between users and images, and the extremely diverse visual contents of images. To address the challenges, we propose a novel deep model which learns the unified feature representations for both users and images. This is done by transforming the heterogeneous user-image networks into homogeneous low-dimensional representations, which facilitate a recommender to trivially recommend images to users by feature similarity. We also develop a fast online algorithm that can be easily scaled up to large networks in an asynchronously parallel way. We conduct extensive experiments on a representative subset of Pinterest, containing 1,456,540 images and 1,000,000 users. Results of image recommendation experiments demonstrate that our feature learning approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art recommendation methods.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Xue Geng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geng:Xue", "Hanwang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hanwang", "Jingwen Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Jingwen", "Tat-Seng Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Tat=Seng"], "pages": 9}
