We propose a new low-level analysis based on latent silhouette cues, particularly suited for low-texture and outdoor datasets. Our analysis does not rely on explicit surface representations, instead using an EM framework to simultaneously update a set of volumetric voxel occupancy probabilities and retrieve a best estimate of the dense 3D motion field from the last consecutively observed multi-view frame set. As the framework uses only latent, probabilistic silhouette information, the method yields a promising 3D scene analysis method robust to many sources of noise and arbitrary scene objects. It can be used as input for higher level shape modeling and structural inference tasks. We validate the approach and demonstrate its practical use for shape and motion analysis experimentally.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of Bordeaux", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Li Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Li", "Jean-S\u00e9bastien Franco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Franco:Jean=S=eacute=bastien", "Edmond Boyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boyer:Edmond", "Marc Pollefeys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pollefeys:Marc"], "pages": 8}
