{"title": "Encoding Relation Requirements for Relation Extraction via Joint Inference.", "fields": ["exploit", "cardinality", "inference", "knowledge base", "relationship extraction"], "abstract": "Most existing relation extraction models make predictions for each entity pair locally and individually, while ignoring implicit global clues available in the knowledge base, sometimes leading to conflicts among local predictions from different entity pairs. In this paper, we propose a joint inference framework that utilizes these global clues to resolve disagreements among local predictions. We exploit two kinds of clues to generate constraints which can capture the implicit type and cardinality requirements of a relation. Experimental results on three datasets, in both English and Chinese, show that our framework outperforms the state-of-theart relation extraction models when such clues are applicable to the datasets. And, we find that the clues learnt automatically from existing knowledge bases perform comparably to those refined by human.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Liwei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Liwei", "Yansong Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Yansong", "Songfang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Songfang", "Yong Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Yong", "Dongyan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Dongyan"], "pages": 10}
