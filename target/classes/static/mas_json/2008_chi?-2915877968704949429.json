To address the growing rate of sedentary lifestyles, we have developed a system, UbiFit Garden, which uses these technologies and a personal, mobile display to encourage physical activity. We conducted a 3-week field trial in which 12 participants used the system and report findings focusing on their experiences with the sensing and activity inference. We discuss key implications for systems that use on-body sensing and activity inference to encourage physical activity.", "citation": "Citations (1,084)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Intel", "University of Washington", "Intel", "Intel", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sunny Consolvo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Consolvo:Sunny", "David W.
