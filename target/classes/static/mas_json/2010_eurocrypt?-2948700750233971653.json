{"title": "Adaptive Trapdoor Functions and Chosen-Ciphertext Security.", "fields": ["random oracle", "lossy compression", "ciphertext", "trapdoor function", "public key cryptography"], "abstract": "We introduce the notion of adaptive trapdoor functions (ATDFs); roughly, ATDFs remain one-way even when the adversary is given access to an inversion oracle. Our main application is the black-box construction of chosen-ciphertext secure public-key encryption (CCA-secure PKE). Namely, we give a black-box construction of CCA-Secure PKE from ATDFs, as well as a construction of ATDFs from correlation-secure TDFs introduced by Rosen and Segev (TCC \u201909). Moreover, by an extension of a recent result of Vahlis (TCC \u201910), we show that ATDFs are strictly weaker than the latter (in a black-box sense). Thus, adaptivity appears to be the weakest condition on a TDF currently known to yield the first implication.\n\nWe also give a black-box construction of CCA-secure PKE from a natural extension of ATDFs we call tag-based ATDFs that, when applied to our constructions of the latter from either correlation-secure TDFs, or lossy TDFs introduced by Peikert and Waters (STOC \u201908), yield precisely the CCA-secure PKE schemes in these works. This helps to unify and clarify their schemes. Finally, we show how to realize tag-based ATDFs from an assumption on RSA inversion not known to yield correlation-secure TDFs.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Eike Kiltz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiltz:Eike", "Payman Mohassel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohassel:Payman", "Adam O'Neill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Neill:Adam"], "pages": 20}
