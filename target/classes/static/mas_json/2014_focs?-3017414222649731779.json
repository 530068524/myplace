The problems we consider include dynamic versions of bipartite perfect matching, bipartite maximum weight matching, single source reachability, single source shortest paths, strong connectivity, subgraph connectivity, diameter approximation and some nongraph problems such as Pagh's problem defined in a recent paper by pa#x0103;traa#x015F;cu [STOC 2010].", "citation": "Citations (160)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Amir Abboud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abboud:Amir", "Virginia Vassilevska Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Virginia_Vassilevska"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
