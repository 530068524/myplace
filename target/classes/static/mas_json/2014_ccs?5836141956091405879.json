In order to understand users' behaviors and attitudes towards the security of their smartphone data, we conducted 28 qualitative interviews. We examined why users choose (or choose not) to employ locking mechanisms (e.g., PINs) and their perceptions and awareness about the sensitivity of the data stored on their devices. We performed two additional online experiments to quantify our interview results and the extent to which sensitive data could be found in a user's smartphone-accessible email archive. We observed a strong correlation between use of security features and risk perceptions, which indicates rational behavior. However, we also observed that most users likely underestimate the extent to which data stored on their smartphones pervades their identities, online and offline.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["International Computer Science Institute", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Serge Egelman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egelman:Serge", "Sakshi Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Sakshi", "Rebecca S.
