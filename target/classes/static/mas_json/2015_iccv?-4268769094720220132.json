We introduce a deep convolutional architecture that yields patch-level descriptors, as an alternative to the popular SIFT descriptor for image retrieval. The proposed family of descriptors, called Patch-CKN, adapt the recently introduced Convolutional Kernel Network (CKN), an unsupervised framework to learn convolutional architectures. We present a comparison framework to benchmark current deep convolutional approaches along with Patch-CKN for both patch and image retrieval, including our novel \"RomePatches\" dataset. Patch-CKN descriptors yield competitive results compared to supervised CNN alternatives on patch and image retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (101)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Mattis Paulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paulin:Mattis", "Matthijs Douze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Douze:Matthijs", "Za\u00efd Harchaoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harchaoui:Za=iuml=d", "Julien Mairal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mairal:Julien", "Florent Perronnin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perronnin:Florent", "Cordelia Schmid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmid:Cordelia"], "pages": 9}
