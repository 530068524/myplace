The key to their success lies in the spatially invariant modeling of pairwise (2nd order) feature interactions. In this work, we propose a general pooling framework that captures higher order interactions of features in the form of kernels. We demonstrate how to approximate kernels such as Gaussian RBF up to a given order using compact explicit feature maps in a parameter-free manner. Combined with CNNs, the composition of the kernel can be learned from data in an end-to-end fashion via error back-propagation. The proposed kernel pooling scheme is evaluated in terms of both kernel approximation error and visual recognition accuracy. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on commonly used fine-grained recognition datasets.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Baidu"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yin Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Yin", "Feng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Feng", "Jiang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jiang", "Xiao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiao", "Yuanqing Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Yuanqing", "Serge J.
