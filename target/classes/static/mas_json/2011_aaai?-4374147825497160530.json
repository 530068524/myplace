Recent work has shown that we can create end-user interactive machine learning systems for specific applications. However, we still lack a generalized understanding of how to design effective end-user interaction with interactive machine learning systems. This work presents three explorations in designing for effective end-user interaction with machine learning in CueFlik, a system developed to support Web image search. These explorations demonstrate that interactions designed to balance the needs of end-users and machine learning algorithms can significantly improve the effectiveness of end-user interactive machine learning.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Saleema Amershi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amershi:Saleema", "James Fogarty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fogarty:James", "Ashish Kapoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapoor:Ashish", "Desney S.
