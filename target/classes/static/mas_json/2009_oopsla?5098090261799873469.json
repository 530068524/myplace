Their work kicked off a flood of research on semantics and type theory for object-oriented programming, which continues to this day. Despite 25 years of research, there is still widespread confusion about the two forms of data abstraction,  abstract data types  and  objects . This essay attempts to explain the differences and also why the differences matter.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "oopsla", "authors": ["William R.
