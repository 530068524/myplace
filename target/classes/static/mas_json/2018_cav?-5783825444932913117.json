{"title": "Nagini: A Static Verifier for Python.", "fields": ["python", "deadlock", "memory safety", "viper", "modular design"], "abstract": "We present Nagini, an automated, modular verifier for statically-typed, concurrent Python 3 programs, built on the Viper verification infrastructure. Combining established concepts with new ideas, Nagini can verify memory safety, functional properties, termination, deadlock freedom, and input/output behavior. Our experiments show that Nagini is able to verify non-trivial properties of real-world Python code.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Marco Eilers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eilers:Marco", "Peter M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:Peter"], "pages": 8}
