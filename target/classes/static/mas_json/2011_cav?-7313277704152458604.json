{"title": "The BINCOA Framework for Binary Code Analysis.", "fields": ["binary code", "executable", "symbolic execution", "test data generation", "graph"], "abstract": "This paper presents the BINCOA framework, whose goal is to ease the development of binary code analysers by providing an open formal model for low-level programs (typically: executable files), an XML format for easy exchange of models and some basic tool support. The BINCOA framework already comes with three different analysers, including simulation, test generation and Control-Flow Graph reconstruction.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["L'Abri", "L'Abri", "L'Abri", "CEA, LIST, Gif- ...
