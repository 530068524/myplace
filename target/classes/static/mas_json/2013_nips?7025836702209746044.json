The algorithm draws on two main ideas. First, it generates two views consisting of computationally inexpensive random features. Second, multiview regression, using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) on unlabeled data, biases the regression towards useful features. It has been shown that CCA regression can substantially reduce variance with a minimal increase in bias if the views contains accurate estimators. Recent theoretical and empirical work shows that regression with random features closely approximates kernel regression, implying that the accuracy requirement holds for random views. We show that XNV consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm for semi-supervised learning: substantially improving predictive performance and reducing the variability of performance on a wide variety of real-world datasets, whilst also reducing runtime by orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Brian McWilliams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McWilliams:Brian", "David Balduzzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balduzzi:David", "Joachim M.
