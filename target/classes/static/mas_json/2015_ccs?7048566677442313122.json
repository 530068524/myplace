{"title": "From Facepalm to Brain Bender: Exploring Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting.", "fields": ["client side", "cross site scripting", "facepalm", "javascript", "scripting language"], "abstract": "Although studies have shown that at least one in ten Web pages contains a client-side XSS vulnerability, the prevalent causes for this class of Cross-Site Scripting have not been studied in depth. Therefore, in this paper, we present a large-scale study to gain insight into these causes. To this end, we analyze a set of 1,273 real-world vulnerabilities contained on the Alexa Top 10k domains using a specifically designed architecture, consisting of an infrastructure which allows us to persist and replay vulnerabilities to ensure a sound analysis. In combination with a taint-aware browsing engine, we can therefore collect important execution trace information for all flaws. Based on the observable characteristics of the vulnerable JavaScript, we derive a set of metrics to measure the complexity of each flaw. We subsequently classify all vulnerabilities in our data set accordingly to enable a more systematic analysis. In doing so, we find that although a large portion of all vulnerabilities have a low complexity rating, several incur a significant level of complexity and are repeatedly caused by vulnerable third-party scripts. In addition, we gain insights into other factors related to the existence of client-side XSS flaws, such as missing knowledge of browser-provided APIs, and find that the root causes for Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting range from unaware developers to incompatible first- and third-party code.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "Ruhr University Bochum", "SAP SE, Karlsruhe, Germany", "SAP SE, Karlsruhe, Germany"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Ben Stock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stock:Ben", "Stephan Pfistner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfistner:Stephan", "Bernd Kaiser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaiser:Bernd", "Sebastian Lekies.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lekies:Sebastian", "Martin Johns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johns:Martin"], "pages": 12}
