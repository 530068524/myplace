We show that any quantum algorithm in this model whose total query time is T can be simulated by a quantum algorithm in the discrete-time query model that makes O(T log T / loglog T) subset O~(T) queries. This is the first such upper bound that is independent of the driving operations (i.e., it holds even if the norm of the driving Hamiltonian is very large). A corollary is that any lower bound of T queries for a problem in the discrete-time query model immediately carries over to a lower bound of Omega(T loglog T / log T) subset Omega~(T) in the continuous-time query model.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics", "University of Waterloo", "Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Richard Cleve.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cleve:Richard", "Daniel Gottesman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottesman:Daniel", "Michele Mosca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mosca:Michele", "Rolando D.
