While most previous approaches are either limited to special kinds of queries, or do not scale to large image sets, we propose a new method, efficient subimage retrieval (ESR), that is at the same time very flexible and very efficient. Relying on a two-layered branch-and-bound setup, ESR performs object-based image retrieval in sets of 100,000 or more images within seconds. An extensive evaluation on several datasets shows that ESR is not only very fast, but it also achieves excellent detection accuracies thereby improving over previous systems for object-based image retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Max Planck Society"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Christoph H.
