Existing attempts to parallelize inference in such models have relied on introducing approximations, which can lead to inaccuracies in the posterior estimate. In this paper, we describe auxiliary variable representations for the Dirichlet process and the hierarchical Dirichlet process that allow us to perform MCMC using the correct equilibrium distribution, in a distributed manner. We show that our approach allows scalable inference without the deterioration in estimate quality that accompanies existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Sinead Williamson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williamson:Sinead", "Avinava Dubey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dubey:Avinava", "Eric P.
