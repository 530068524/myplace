This situation, which is largely overlooked in the literature, is commonplace in several types of creative tasks, one of which is exploratory programming. In this paper, we investigate how novice programmers forage through similar variants. Based on our results, we propose a refinement to Information Foraging Theory (IFT) to include constructs about variation foraging behavior, and propose refinements to computational models of IFT to better account for foraging among variants.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sruti Srinivasa Ragavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ragavan:Sruti_Srinivasa", "Sandeep Kaur Kuttal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuttal:Sandeep_Kaur", "Charles Hill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hill:Charles", "Anita Sarma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarma:Anita", "David Piorkowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piorkowski:David", "Margaret M.
