The main advantage of this novel technology is its ability to provide more human-centric operation as compared to a conventional NFC communication. In our demonstrations, two applications are introduced. The first one is the illustration of user authentication being realized by shaking hands with a doll. The electric field type NFC by electric induction coupling is utilized. The second application demonstrates an Apple Pay on HBC and two scenarios of \"contact\" communication with a finger to NFC reader and NFC transaction with a touch panel display are introduced. On outline of the structure of the demo system is also presented to explain the operational principle of the HBC.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["eNFC Inc., Tokyo, Japan", "eNFC Inc., Tokyo, Japan"], "authors": ["Takanori Washiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Washiro:Takanori", "Andrey Andrenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andrenko:Andrey"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
