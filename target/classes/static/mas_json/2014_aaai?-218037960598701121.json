However, the case that both training images and testing images are corrupted is not well addressed. Motivated by the success of low-rank matrix recovery, we propose a novel semi-supervised low-rank matrix recovery algorithm for robust face recognition. The proposed method can learn robust discriminative representations for both training images and testing images simultaneously by exploiting the classwise block-diagonal structure. Specifically, low-rank matrix approximation can handle the possible contamination of data. Moreover, the classwise block-diagonal structure is exploited to promote discrimination of representations for robust recognition. The above issues are formulated into a unified objective function and we design an efficient optimization procedure based on augmented Lagrange multiplier method to solve it. Extensive experiments on three public databases are performed to validate the effectiveness of our approach. The strong identification capability of representations with block-diagonal structure is verified.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Nanjing University of Science and Technology", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Yong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yong", "Jing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Jing", "Zechao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zechao", "Yangmuzi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yangmuzi", "Hanqing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hanqing", "Songde Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Songde"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
