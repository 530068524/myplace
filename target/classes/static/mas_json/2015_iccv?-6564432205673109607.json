A point set is first decomposed into small clusters, using fuzzy clustering. We evaluate cluster uniqueness and spatial distribution of each cluster and combine these values into a cluster saliency function. Finally, the probabilities of points belonging to each cluster are used to assign a saliency to each point. Our approach detects fine-scale salient features and uninteresting regions consistently have lower saliency values. We evaluate the proposed saliency model by testing our saliency-based keypoint detection against a 3D interest point detection benchmark. The evaluation shows that our method achieves a good balance between false positive and false negative error rates, without using any topological information.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Flora Ponjou Tasse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tasse:Flora_Ponjou", "Jir\u00ed Kosinka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kosinka:Jir=iacute=", "Neil A.
