Offline evaluation metrics are indicators of the expected model performance on real data. However, in practice we often experience substantial discrepancy between the offline and online performance of the models.   We investigate the characteristics and behaviors of the evaluation metrics on offline and online testing both analytically and empirically by experimenting them on online advertising data from the Bing search engine. One of our findings is that some offline metrics like AUC (the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) and RIG (Relative Information Gain) that summarize the model performance on the entire spectrum of operating points could be quite misleading sometimes and result in significant discrepancy in offline and online metrics. For example, for click prediction models for search advertising, errors in predictions in the very low range of predicted click scores impact the online performance much more negatively than errors in other regions. Most of the offline metrics we studied including AUC and RIG, however, are insensitive to such model behavior.   We designed a new model evaluation paradigm that simulates the online behavior of predictive models. For a set of ads selected by a new prediction model, the online user behavior is estimated from the historic user behavior in the search logs. The experimental results on click prediction model for search advertising are highly promising.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Jeonghee Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Jeonghee", "Ye Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ye", "Jie Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jie", "Swaraj Sett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sett:Swaraj", "Tak W.
