{"title": "Context-aware application scheduling in mobile systems: what will users do and not do next?", "fields": ["scheduling", "android", "mobile device", "unsupervised learning", "real time computing"], "abstract": "Usage patterns of mobile devices depend on a variety of factors such as time, location, and previous actions. Hence, context-awareness can be the key to make mobile systems to become personalized and situation dependent in managing their resources. We first reveal new findings from our own Android user experiment: (i) the launching probabilities of applications follow Zipf's law, and (ii) inter-running and running times of applications conform to log-normal distributions. We also find context-dependency in application usage patterns, for which we classify contexts in a personalized manner with unsupervised learning methods. Using the knowledge acquired, we develop a novel context-aware application scheduling framework, CAS that adaptively unloads and preloads background applications in a timely manner. Our trace-driven simulations with 96 user traces demonstrate the benefits of CAS over existing algorithms. We also verify the practicality of CAS by implementing it on the Android platform.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "ECE, OSU, Columbus, OH", "ECE and CSE, OSU, Columbus, OH"], "authors": ["Joohyun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joohyun", "Kyunghan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kyunghan", "Euijin Jeong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeong:Euijin", "Jaemin Jo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jo:Jaemin", "Ness B.
