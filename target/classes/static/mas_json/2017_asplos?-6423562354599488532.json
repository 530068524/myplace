However, existing systems for remote Flash access either introduce significant performance overheads or fail to isolate the multiple remote clients sharing each Flash device. We present ReFlex, a software-based system for remote Flash access, that provides nearly identical performance to accessing local Flash. ReFlex uses a dataplane kernel to closely integrate networking and storage processing to achieve low latency and high throughput at low resource requirements. Specifically, ReFlex can serve up to 850K IOPS per core over TCP/IP networking, while adding 21us over direct access to local Flash. ReFlex uses a QoS scheduler that can enforce tail latency and throughput service-level objectives (SLOs) for thousands of remote clients. We show that ReFlex allows applications to use remote Flash while maintaining their original performance with local Flash.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Ana Klimovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klimovic:Ana", "Heiner Litz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Litz:Heiner", "Christos Kozyrakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozyrakis:Christos"], "pages": 15}
