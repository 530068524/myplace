In it, we give a brief introduction to Fourier analysis of boolean functions and then discuss some applications: Arrow's Theorem and other ideas from the theory of Social Choice; the Bonami-Beckner Inequality as an extension of Chernoff/Hoeffding bounds to higher-degree polynomials; and, hardness for approximation algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ryan O'Donnell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Donnell:Ryan"], "pages": 10}
