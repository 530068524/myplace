{"title": "Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks on Printers.", "fields": ["microphone", "linear classifier", "audio signal processing", "incremental learning", "side channel attack"], "abstract": "We examine the problemof acoustic emanations of printers. We present a novel attack that recovers what a dot-matrix printer processing English text is printing based on a record of the sound it makes, if the microphone is close enough to the printer. In our experiments, the attack recovers up to 72 % of printed words, and up to 95 % if we assume contextual knowledge about the text, with a microphone at a distance of 10cmfrom the printer. After an upfront training phase, the attack is fully automated and uses a combination of machine learning, audio processing, and speech recognition techniques, including spectrum features, Hidden Markov Models and linear classification; moreover, it allows for feedback-based incremental learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures, and we describe how we successfully mounted the attack in-field (with appropriate privacy protections) in a doctor's practice to recover the content of medical prescriptions.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Michael Backes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Backes_0001:Michael", "Markus D\u00fcrmuth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=uuml=rmuth:Markus", "Sebastian Gerling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerling:Sebastian", "Manfred Pinkal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinkal:Manfred", "Caroline Sporleder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sporleder:Caroline"], "pages": 16}
