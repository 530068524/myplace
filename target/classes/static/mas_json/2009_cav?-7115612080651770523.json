{"title": "Beaver: Engineering an Efficient SMT Solver for Bit-Vector Arithmetic.", "fields": ["local consistency", "satisfiability modulo theories", "graph rewriting", "boolean satisfiability problem", "bit array"], "abstract": "We present the key ideas in the design and implementation of Beaver, an SMT solver for quantifier-free finite-precision bit-vector logic (QF_BV). Beaver uses an eager approach, encoding the original SMT problem into a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem using a series of word-level and bit-level transformations. In this paper, we describe the most effective transformations, such as propagating constants and equalities at the word-level, and using and-inverter graph rewriting techniques at the bit-level. We highlight implementation details of these transformations that distinguishes Beaver from other solvers. We present an experimental analysis of the effectiveness of Beaver's techniques on both hardware and software benchmarks with a selection of back-end SAT solvers.\n\nBeaver is an open-source tool implemented in Ocaml, usable with any back-end SAT engine, and has a well-documented extensible code base that can be used to experiment with new algorithms and techniques.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Susmit Jha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jha:Susmit", "Rhishikesh Limaye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Limaye:Rhishikesh", "Sanjit A.
