{"title": "Contract-based resource verification for higher-order functions with memoization.", "fields": ["queue", "lazy evaluation", "mutual recursion", "memoization", "lazy initialization"], "abstract": "We present a new approach for specifying and verifying resource utilization of higher-order functional programs that use lazy evaluation and memoization. In our approach, users can specify the desired resource bound as templates with numerical holes e.g. as steps \u00e2 \ufffd ? * size(l) + ? in the contracts of functions. They can also express invariants necessary for establishing the bounds that may depend on the state of memoization. Our approach operates in two phases: first generating an instrumented first-order program that accurately models the higher-order control flow and the effects of memoization on resources using sets, algebraic datatypes and mutual recursion, and then verifying the contracts of the first-order program by producing verification conditions of the form \u00e2   \u00e2   using an extended assume/guarantee reasoning. We use our approach to verify precise bounds on resources such as evaluation steps and number of heap-allocated objects on 17 challenging data structures and algorithms. Our benchmarks, comprising of 5K lines of functional Scala code, include  lazy mergesort , Okasaki\u00e2  s  real-time queue  and  deque  data structures that rely on aliasing of references to first-class functions; lazy data structures based on numerical representations such as the  conqueue  data structure of Scala\u00e2  s data-parallel library, cyclic streams, as well as dynamic programming algorithms such as  knapsack  and  Viterbi . Our evaluations show that when averaged over all benchmarks the actual runtime resource consumption is 80% of the value inferred by our tool when estimating the number of evaluation steps, and is 88% for the number of heap-allocated objects.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Ravichandhran Madhavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madhavan:Ravichandhran", "Sumith Kulal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulal:Sumith", "Viktor Kuncak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuncak:Viktor"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
