To date, these diversification mechanisms are largely hand-coded or relied on expensive training data provided by experts. To overcome this problem, we propose an online learning model and algorithms for learning diversified recommendations and retrieval functions from implicit feedback. In our model, the learning algorithm presents a ranking to the user at each step, and uses the set of documents from the presented ranking, which the user reads, as feedback. Even for imperfect and noisy feedback, we show that the algorithms admit theoretical guarantees for maximizing any submodular utility measure under approximately rational user behavior. In addition to the theoretical results, we find that the algorithm learns quickly, accurately, and robustly in empirical evaluations on two datasets.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Karthik Raman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raman_0001:Karthik", "Pannaga Shivaswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shivaswamy:Pannaga", "Thorsten Joachims.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joachims:Thorsten"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
