In this paper, we present the results of three studies focusing on the foursquare check-in system. We conducted interviews and two surveys to understand, both qualitatively and quantitatively, how and why people use location sharing applications, as well as how they manage their privacy. We also document surprising uses of foursquare, and discuss implications for design of mobile social services.", "citation": "Citations (433)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Janne Lindqvist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindqvist:Janne", "Justin Cranshaw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cranshaw:Justin", "Jason Wiese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiese:Jason", "Jason I.
