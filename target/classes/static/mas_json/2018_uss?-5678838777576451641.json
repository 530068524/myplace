Training these networks is computationally expensive and requires vast amounts of training data. Selling such pre-trained models can, therefore, be a lucrative business model. Unfortunately, once the models are sold they can be easily copied and redistributed. To avoid this, a tracking mechanism to identify models as the intellectual property of a particular vendor is necessary. In this work, we present an approach for watermarking Deep Neural Networks in a black-box way. Our scheme works for general classification tasks and can easily be combined with current learning algorithms. We show experimentally that such a watermark has no noticeable impact on the primary task that the model is designed for. Moreover, we evaluate the robustness of our proposal against a multitude of practical attacks.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Facebook", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Yossi Adi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adi:Yossi", "Carsten Baum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baum:Carsten", "Moustapha Ciss\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciss=eacute=:Moustapha", "Benny Pinkas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinkas:Benny", "Joseph Keshet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keshet:Joseph"], "pages": 17}
