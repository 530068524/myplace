Unfortunately, existing methods in stakeholder analysis are likely to omit stakeholders, and consider all stakeholders as equally influential. To identify and prioritise stakeholders, we have developed StakeNet, which consists of three main steps: identify stakeholders and ask them to recommend other stakeholders and stakeholder roles, build a social network whose nodes are stakeholders and links are recommendations, and prioritise stakeholders using a variety of social network measures. To evaluate StakeNet, we conducted one of the first empirical studies of requirements stakeholders on a software project for a 30,000-user system. Using the data collected from surveying and interviewing 68 stakeholders, we show that StakeNet identifies stakeholders and their roles with high recall, and accurately prioritises them. StakeNet uncovers a critical stakeholder role overlooked in the project, whose omission significantly impacted project success.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "departments": ["University College London", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University College London"], "authors": ["Soo Ling Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Soo_Ling", "Daniele Quercia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quercia:Daniele", "Anthony Finkelstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finkelstein:Anthony"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
