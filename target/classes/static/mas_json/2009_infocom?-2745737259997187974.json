{"title": "Failure Control in Multipath Route Tracing.", "fields": ["tracing", "traceroute", "multipath routing", "hop", "multipath propagation"], "abstract": "Traceroute is widely used to report the path packets take between two internet hosts, but the widespread deployment of load balancing routers breaks a basic assumption - that there is only a single such path. We specify an adaptive, stochastic probing algorithm, the Multipath Detection Algorithm (MDA), to report all paths that probes can follow between a source and a destination. We establish the foundations of, and show how to calculate, rigorous statistical guarantees for the discovery of the entire multipath route. We explore algorithm cost/guarantee tradeoffs in real experiments and show the inadequacy of the classic practice of sending three probes per hop.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Darryl Veitch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veitch:Darryl", "Brice Augustin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Augustin:Brice", "Renata Teixeira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teixeira:Renata", "Timur Friedman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedman:Timur"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
