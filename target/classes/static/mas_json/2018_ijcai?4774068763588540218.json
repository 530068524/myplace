{"title": "Redividing the Cake.", "fields": ["rectilinear polygon", "regular polygon", "contiguity", "rectangle", "convex polygon"], "abstract": "A heterogeneous resource, such as a land-estate, is already divided among several agents in an unfair way. It should be re-divided among the agents in a way that balances fairness with ownership rights. We present re-division protocols that attain various trade-off points between fairness and ownership rights, in various settings differing in the geometric constraints on the allotments: (a) no geometric constraints; (b) connectivity --- the cake is a one-dimensional interval and each piece must be a contiguous interval; (c) rectangularity --- the cake is a two-dimensional rectangle or rectilinear polygon and the pieces should be rectangles; (d) convexity --- the cake is a two-dimensional convex polygon and the pieces should be convex. \nOur re-division protocols have implications on another problem: the price-of-fairness --- the loss of social welfare caused by fairness requirements. Each protocol implies an upper bound on the price-of-fairness with the respective geometric constraints.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Ariel University"], "authors": ["Erel Segal-Halevi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segal=Halevi:Erel"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
