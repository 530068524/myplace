Refactoring tools can automatically perform and check the correctness of refactorings. However, even when developers have these tools, they still perform about 90% of refactorings manually, which is error-prone. To address this problem, we propose a technique called GhostFactor separating transformation and correctness checking: we allow the developer to transform code manually, but check the correctness of her transformation automatically. We implemented our technique as a Visual Studio plugin, then evaluated it with a human study of eight software developers; GhostFactor improved the correctness of manual refactorings by 67%.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Xi Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Xi", "Emerson R.
