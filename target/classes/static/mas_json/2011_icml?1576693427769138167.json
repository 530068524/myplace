In this work, we propose the use of fixed piecewise linear and quadratic upper bounds to the logistic-log-partition (LLP) function as a way of circumventing this intractable integral. We describe a framework for approximately computing minimax optimal piecewise quadratic bounds, as well a generalized expectation maximization algorithm based on using piecewise bounds to estimate bLGMs. We prove a theoretical result relating the maximum error in the LLP bound to the maximum error in the marginal likelihood estimate. Finally, we present empirical results showing that piece-wise bounds can be significantly more accurate than previously proposed variational bounds.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Benjamin M.
