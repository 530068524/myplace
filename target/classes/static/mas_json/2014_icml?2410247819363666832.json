However, these methods often require extensive experience in a domain to achieve high performance. To make agents more sample-efficient, we developed a multi-task policy gradient method to learn decision making tasks consecutively, transferring knowledge between tasks to accelerate learning. Our approach provides robust theoretical guarantees, and we show empirically that it dramatically accelerates learning on a variety of dynamical systems, including an application to quadrotor control.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "Franklin W.
