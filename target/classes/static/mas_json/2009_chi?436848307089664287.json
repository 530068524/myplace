Incidentally, the bandwidth calculating means calculates a priority level from the number of cursors existing in a display frame of each of the computer devices, and determines the bandwidth based on the priority level.", "citation": "Citations (18,986)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Brother Industries", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Google", "Google", "OpenAI", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "West Virginia University", "Brother Industries", "Microsoft", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alex S.
