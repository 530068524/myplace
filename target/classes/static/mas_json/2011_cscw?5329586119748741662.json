In this paper, we describe how we used Adam Kendon's characterisation of the F-formation system of spatial organisation as a conceptual lens to analyse the social interactions between visitors and staff in a tourist information centre. We describe how the physical structures in the space encouraged and discouraged particular kinds of interactions and discuss how F-formations might be used to think about augmenting physical spaces.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "Open University", "Open University"], "authors": ["Paul Marshall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marshall:Paul", "Yvonne Rogers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogers:Yvonne", "Nadia Pantidi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pantidi:Nadia"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
