{"title": "Video Primal Sketch: A generic middle-level representation of video.", "fields": ["sketch", "neural coding", "generative model", "parametric statistics", "image texture"], "abstract": "This paper presents a middle-level video representation named Video Primal Sketch (VPS), which integrates two regimes of models: i) sparse coding model using static or moving primitives to explicitly represent moving corners, lines, feature points, etc., ii) FRAME/MRF model with spatio-temporal filters to implicitly represent textured motion, such as water and fire, by matching feature statistics, i.e. histograms. This paper makes three contributions: i) learning a dictionary of video primitives as parametric generative model; ii) studying the Spatio-Temporal FRAME (ST-FRAME) model for modeling and synthesizing textured motion; and iii) developing a parsimonious hybrid model for generic video representation. VPS selects the proper representation automatically and is compatible with high-level action representations. In the experiments, we synthesize a series of dynamic textures, reconstruct real videos and show varying VPS over the change of densities causing by the scale transition in videos.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Zhi Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Zhi", "Zongben Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zongben", "Song-Chun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Song=Chun"], "pages": 8}
