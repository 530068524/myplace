{"title": "Shallow Blue: Lego-Based Embodied AI as a Platform for Cross-Curricular Project Based Learning.", "fields": ["simulation", "focal point", "software", "project based learning", "embodied cognition"], "abstract": "We report on Shallow Blue (SB), an autonomous chess agent constructed by a small group of faculty and undergraduate students at Canisius College. In addition to pushing the limits of consumer grade components at low cost, SB is a focal point for interdisciplinary student projects spanning computer science, engineering, and physics. We demonstrate that undergraduate students can engage in rich, long-term robotic design and applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) from both hardware and software perspectives. Student outcomes of SB include senior theses, conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and admission to graduate programs. Students who participated also report substantial development in skills and knowledge applicable to their post-undergraduate education and careers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Canisius College", "Canisius College"], "authors": ["Robert Selkowitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Selkowitz:Robert", "Debra T.
