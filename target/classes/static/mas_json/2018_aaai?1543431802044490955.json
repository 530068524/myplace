{"title": "MUDA: A Truthful Multi-Unit Double-Auction Mechanism.", "fields": ["mathematical economics", "double auction", "muda", "valuation", "common value auction"], "abstract": "In a seminal paper, McAfee (1992) presented a truthful mechanism for double auctions, attaining asymptotically-optimal gain-from-trade without any prior information on the valuations of the traders. McAfee's mechanism handles single-parametric agents, allowing each seller to sell a single unit and each buyer to buy a single unit. This paper presents a double-auction mechanism that handles multi-parametric agents and allows multiple units per trader, as long as the valuation functions of all traders have decreasing marginal returns. The mechanism is prior-free, ex-post individually-rational, dominant-strategy truthful and strongly-budget-balanced. Its gain-from-trade approaches the optimum when the market size is sufficiently large.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University"], "authors": ["Erel Segal-Halevi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Segal=Halevi:Erel", "Avinatan Hassidim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassidim:Avinatan", "Yonatan Aumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aumann:Yonatan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
