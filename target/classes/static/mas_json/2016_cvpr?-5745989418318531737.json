We present a simple yet surprisingly effective online hard example mining (OHEM) algorithm for training region-based ConvNet detectors. Our motivation is the same as it has always been \u2013 detection datasets contain an overwhelming number of easy examples and a small number of hard examples. Automatic selection of these hard examples can make training more effective and efficient. OHEM is a simple and intuitive algorithm that eliminates several heuristics and hyperparameters in common use. But more importantly, it yields consistent and significant boosts in detection performance on benchmarks like PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. Its effectiveness increases as datasets become larger and more difficult, as demonstrated by the results on the MS COCO dataset. Moreover, combined with complementary advances in the field, OHEM leads to state-of-the-art results of 78.9% and 76.3% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 respectively.", "citation": "Citations (318)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Facebook"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Abhinav Shrivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrivastava:Abhinav", "Abhinav Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Abhinav", "Ross B.
