{"title": "Exploring the future of out-of-core computing with compute-local non-volatile memory.", "fields": ["non volatile memory", "nvm express", "supercomputer", "file system", "throughput", "out of core algorithm"], "abstract": "Drawing parallels to the rise of general purpose graphical processing units (GPGPUs) as accelerators for specific high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, there is a rise in the use of non-volatile memory (NVM) as accelerators for I/O-intensive scientific applications. However, existing works have explored use of NVM within dedicated I/O nodes, which are distant from the compute nodes that actually need such acceleration. As NVM bandwidth begins to out-pace point-to-point network capacity, we argue for the need to break from the archetype of completely separated storage.   Therefore, in this work we investigate co-location of NVM and compute by varying I/O interfaces, file systems, types of NVM, and both current and future SSD architectures, uncovering numerous bottlenecks implicit in these various levels in the I/O stack. We present novel hardware and software solutions, including the new Unified File System (UFS), to enable fuller utilization of the new compute-local NVM storage. Our experimental evaluation, which employs a real-world Out-of-Core (OoC) HPC application, demonstrates throughput increases in excess of an order of magnitude over current approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "Pennsylvania State University", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Electrical Engineering"], "authors": ["Myoungsoo Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Myoungsoo", "Ellis Herbert Wilson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilson:Ellis_Herbert", "Wonil Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Wonil", "John Shalf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalf:John", "Hasan Metin Aktulga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aktulga:Hasan_Metin", "Chao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Chao", "Erik Saule.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saule:Erik", "\u00dcmit V. \u00c7ataly\u00fcrek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ccedil=ataly=uuml=rek:=Uuml=mit_V=", "Mahmut T.
