{"title": "Lexicalized Phonotactic Word Segmentation.", "fields": ["transcription", "text segmentation", "discriminative model", "phonotactics", "phone"], "abstract": "This paper presents a new unsupervised algorithm (WordEnds) for inferring word boundaries from transcribed adult conversations. Phone ngrams before and after observed pauses are used to bootstrap a simple discriminative model of boundary marking. This fast algorithm delivers high performance even on morphologically complex words in English and Arabic, and promising results on accurate phonetic transcriptions with extensive pronunciation variation. Expanding training data beyond the traditional miniature datasets pushes performance numbers well above those previously reported. This suggests that WordEnds is a viable model of child language acquisition and might be useful in speech understanding.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Margaret M.
