Additionally, the quality of those video streams is often reduced by the lack of skills of recording users and the technical limitations of the video capturing devices. Our research focuses on large-scale events that attract dozens of users to record video in parallel. In such scenarios, our aim is to design a collaborative mobile video broadcasting service that composes video streams from multiple sources to create one video stream with enhanced perceived quality. Our realization of such a service combines high quality video streaming and at the same time reduces the network load.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Stefan Wilk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilk:Stefan", "Wolfgang Effelsberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Effelsberg:Wolfgang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
