Target applications include network traffic authentication and hash-table lookups protected against hash-flooding denial-of-service attacks. SipHash is simpler than MACs based on universal hashing, and faster on short inputs. Compared to dedicated designs for hash-table lookup, SipHash has well-defined security goals and competitive performance. For example, SipHash processes a 16-byte input with a fresh key in 140 cycles on an AMD FX-8150 processor, which is much faster than state-of-the-art MACs. We propose that hash tables switch to SipHash as a hash function.", "citation": "Citations (189)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "Brown University", "Brown University", "Aarhus University", "AT&T", "AT&T", "AT&T", "AT&T", "AT&T", "Broadcom", "Broadcom", "Roma Tre University", "Roma Tre University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Brown University", "Boston University", "Verizon Communications", "Verizon Communications", "Verizon Communications", "Verizon Communications", "Verizon Communications", "NAGRA"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Charalampos Papamanthou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papamanthou:Charalampos", "Roberto Tamassia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamassia:Roberto", "Nikos Triandopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Triandopoulos:Nikos"], "pages": 12}
