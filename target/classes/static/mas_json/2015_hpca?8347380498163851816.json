{"title": "Octopus-Man: QoS-driven task management for heterogeneous multicores in warehouse-scale computers.", "fields": ["warehouse", "workload", "task management", "multi core processor", "cpu power dissipation"], "abstract": "Heterogeneous multicore architectures have the potential to improve energy efficiency by integrating power-efficient wimpy cores with high-performing brawny cores. However, it is an open question as how to deliver energy reduction while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) of latency-sensitive web-services running on such heterogeneous multicores in warehouse-scale computers (WSCs). In this work, we first investigate the implications of heterogeneous multicores in WSCs and show that directly adopting heterogeneous multicores without re-designing the software stack to provide QoS management leads to significant QoS violations. We then present Octopus-Man, a novel QoS-aware task management solution that dynamically maps latency-sensitive tasks to the least power-hungry processing resources that are sufficient to meet the QoS requirements. Using carefully-designed feedback-control mechanisms, Octopus-Man addresses critical challenges that emerge due to uncertainties in workload fluctuations and adaptation dynamics in a real system. Our evaluation using web-search and memcached running on a real-system Intel heterogeneous prototype demonstrates that Octopus-Man improves energy efficiency by up to 41% (CPU power) and up to 15% (system power) over an all-brawny WSC design while adhering to specified QoS targets.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Federal University of Bahia", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["Vinicius Petrucci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrucci:Vinicius", "Michael A.
