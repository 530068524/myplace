It has been recently shown that OS-based page coloring allows a non-uniform cache architecture (NUCA) to provide low latencies and not be hindered by complex data search mechanisms. In this work, we extend that concept with mechanisms that dynamically move data within caches. The key innovation is the use of a shadow address space to allow hardware control of data placement in the L2 cache while being largely transparent to the user application and off-chip world. These mechanisms allow the hardware and OS to dynamically manage cache capacity per thread as well as optimize placement of data shared by multiple threads. We show an average IPC improvement of 10-20% for multi-programmed workloads with capacity allocation policies and an average IPC improvement of 8% for multi-threaded workloads with policies for shared page placement.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "authors": ["Manu Awasthi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Awasthi:Manu", "Kshitij Sudan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sudan:Kshitij", "Rajeev Balasubramonian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balasubramonian:Rajeev", "John B.
