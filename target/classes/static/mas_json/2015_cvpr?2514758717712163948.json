In this paper, we propose a novel bottom-up saliency detection approach that takes advantage of both region-based features and image details. To provide more accurate saliency estimations, we first optimize the image boundary selection by the proposed erroneous boundary removal. By taking the image details and region-based estimations into account, we then propose the regularized random walks ranking to formulate pixel-wised saliency maps from the superpixel-based background and foreground saliency estimations. Experiment results on two public datasets indicate the significantly improved accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with 12 state-of-the-art saliency detection approaches.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "University of Sydney"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["ChangYang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:ChangYang", "Yuchen Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Yuchen", "Weidong Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Weidong", "Yong Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Yong", "David Dagan Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:David_Dagan"], "pages": 8}
