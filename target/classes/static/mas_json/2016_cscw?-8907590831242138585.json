{"title": "Networked Privacy Management in Facebook: A Mixed-Methods and Multinational Study.", "fields": ["interpersonal ties", "personally identifiable information", "social computing", "privacy by design", "privacy software"], "abstract": "Users of social network services (SNSs) have to cope with a new set of privacy challenges because personal information on an SNS is often co-owned and co-managed by various distributed social ties. Using a multi-methods and multinational approach, we investigated Facebook users\u00e2   privacy behavior by focusing on how they co-manage private information. Our findings from focus-group interviews (n = 28) and online surveys (n = 299) suggest that Facebook users primarily apply four different practices of privacy management: collaborative strategies, corrective strategies, preventive strategies, and information control. The four dimensions of privacy management display selective relationships with theoretical antecedents (e.g., self-efficacy, collective-efficacy, attitudes, privacy concern), indicating that each behavior is motivated by a different combination of conditions. Implications for research and practice are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Hichang Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Hichang", "Anna Filippova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filippova:Anna"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
