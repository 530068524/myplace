{"title": "We Don't Need No Bounding-Boxes: Training Object Class Detectors Using Only Human Verification.", "fields": ["bounding overwatch", "detector", "theoretical computer science", "annotation", "iterated function"], "abstract": "Training object class detectors typically requires a large set of images in which objects are annotated by boundingboxes. However, manually drawing bounding-boxes is very time consuming. We propose a new scheme for training object detectors which only requires annotators to verify bounding-boxes produced automatically by the learning algorithm. Our scheme iterates between re-training the detector, re-localizing objects in the training images, and human verification. We use the verification signal both to improve re-training and to reduce the search space for re-localisation, which makes these steps different to what is normally done in a weakly supervised setting. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that (1) using human verification to update detectors and reduce the search space leads to the rapid production of high-quality bounding-box annotations, (2) our scheme delivers detectors performing almost as good as those trained in a fully supervised setting, without ever drawing any bounding-box, (3) as the verification task is very quick, our scheme substantially reduces total annotation time by a factor 6\u00d7-9\u00d7.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Democritus University of Thrace", "University of Edinburgh", "School of Informatics", "School of Informatics"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Dim P.
