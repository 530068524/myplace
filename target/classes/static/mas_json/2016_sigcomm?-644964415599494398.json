To run at line rate, these data-plane algorithms must be implemented in hardware. With today's switch hardware, algorithms cannot be changed, nor new algorithms installed, after a switch has been built.   This paper shows how to program data-plane algorithms in a high-level language and compile those programs into low-level microcode that can run on emerging programmable line-rate switching chips. The key challenge is that many data-plane algorithms create and modify algorithmic state. To achieve line-rate programmability for stateful algorithms, we introduce the notion of a packet transaction: a sequential packet-processing code block that is atomic and isolated from other such code blocks.   We have developed this idea in Domino, a C-like imperative language to express data-plane algorithms. We show with many examples that Domino provides a convenient way to express sophisticated data-plane algorithms, and show that these algorithms can be run at line rate with modest estimated chip-area overhead.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Washington", "VMware", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Barefoot Networks"], "authors": ["Anirudh Sivaraman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sivaraman:Anirudh", "Alvin Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Alvin", "Mihai Budiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Budiu:Mihai", "Changhoon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Changhoon", "Mohammad Alizadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alizadeh:Mohammad", "Hari Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Hari", "George Varghese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varghese:George", "Nick McKeown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McKeown:Nick", "Steve Licking.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Licking:Steve"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
