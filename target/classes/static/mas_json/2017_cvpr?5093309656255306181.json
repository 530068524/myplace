This is achieved using a mixture model where the mixing coefficients are modeled by a Dirichlet process, allowing us to integrate over the coefficients when performing inference. Critically, this then allows us to automatically vary the number of autoencoders in the mixture based on the data. Experiments show the flexibility of our method, particularly for semi-supervised learning, where only a small number of training samples are available.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["M.
