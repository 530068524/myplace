Specifically, we consider a decision maker with a limited experimentation budget who must efficiently learn an underlying linear population model. Our main contribution is a novel threshold-based algorithm for selection of most informative observations; we characterize its performance and fundamental lower bounds. We extend the algorithm and its guarantees to sparse linear regression in high-dimensional settings. Simulations suggest the algorithm is remarkably robust: it provides significant benefits over passive random sampling in real-world datasets that exhibit high nonlinearity and high dimensionality --- significantly reducing both the mean and variance of the squared error.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Carlos Riquelme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riquelme:Carlos", "Ramesh Johari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johari:Ramesh", "Baosen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Baosen"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
