In this model, we analyze two new algorithms, for PAC-learning DNFs and agnostically learning decision trees, from random examples drawn from a constant-bounded product distributions. These two problems had previously been solved using membership queries (Jackson, 1995; Gopalan et al, 2005). Our analysis demonstrates that the \"heavy\" Fourier coefficients of a DNF suffice to recover the DNF. We also show that a structural property of the Fourier spectrum of any boolean function over \"typical\" product distributions. In a second model, we consider a simple new distribution over the boolean hypercube, one which is symmetric but is not the uniform distribution, from which we can learn O(log n)-depth decision trees in polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Adam Tauman Kalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalai:Adam_Tauman", "Alex Samorodnitsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samorodnitsky:Alex", "Shang-Hua Teng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teng:Shang=Hua"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
