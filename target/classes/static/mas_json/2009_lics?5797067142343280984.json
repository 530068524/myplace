The results are obtained by using less structure than in the original paper; this has an interest on its own, and we hope that it will open the way to applying the approach of Ludics to a larger domain.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University"], "authors": ["Michele Basaldella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basaldella:Michele", "Claudia Faggian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faggian:Claudia"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
