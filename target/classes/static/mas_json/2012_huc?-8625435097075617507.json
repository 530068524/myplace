The Dempster-Shafer evidence Theory (DST) gives a mathematical convenient framework for the evidential fusion representation and inference of uncertain information. However, DST yields counterintuitive results in high conflicting ambient intelligence situations. This paper aims to provide a new strategy to manage conflict in activity recognition process in the ambient intelligence applications. It addresses the challenge of uncertainty and proposes an evidential fusion model based on the management of conflicting situation to optimize decision making in activity recognition. The proposed approach gives intuitive interpretation for combining multiple sources in conflicting situations and avoids the problems of using The Dempster-Shafer rule of combination.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Paris 12 Val de Marne University", "Paris 12 Val de Marne University", "Paris 12 Val de Marne University", "AI Laboratory,  ... lgiers, Algeria", "LRIA Laboratory ... lgiers, Algeria"], "authors": ["Faouzi Sebbak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebbak:Faouzi", "Abdelghani Chibani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chibani:Abdelghani", "Yacine Amirat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amirat:Yacine", "Farid Benhammadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benhammadi:Farid", "A\u00efcha Mokhtari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mokhtari:A=iuml=cha"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 7}
