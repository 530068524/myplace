{"title": "Local Selection of Features for Image Search and Annotation.", "fields": ["content based image retrieval", "visual word", "feature", "feature detection", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "In image applications, direct representations of images typically involve hundreds or thousands of features and not all the features are relevant for any given object. Errors introduced into similarity measurements by irrelevant or noisy features are detrimental to the semantic performance of content-based image retrieval. Feature selection techniques can be used to identify indiscriminative features from the entire image database. However, such global approach neglects the possibility that the feature importance may vary across different images or classes of images. We propose several techniques for the local selection of features for image databases. By checking the local neighborhood of each image, our methods determine the feature importance with respect to the image and select different feature sets for individual images. We also design methods based on the proposed local selection schemes for KNN graph construction, image search, and graph-based image annotation. We provide experimental results on two image datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["New Jersey Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jichao Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jichao"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
