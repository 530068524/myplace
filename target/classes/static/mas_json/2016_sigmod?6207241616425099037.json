IP and optical services converge in these new infrastructures to form hybrid networks. Lightpaths are the services offered to clients in the optical portion of the network. They are chosen because they guarantee the appropriate QoS in terms of bandwidth and latency. NDL-the Network Description Language-is a data model offering users and providers of lightpaths with a common ontology to describe topology information of hybrid optical networks. The strength of NDL is that it supports a wide range of applications, including pathfinding, visualisation and asset management, via the definition of a common data model to exchange network descriptions. Since NDL is based on the Semantic Web techniques, it is straightforward to relate NDL with application-specific ontologies. In this paper we present the current status of the NDL schemas and its use in several applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "San Antonio River Authority", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "Free University of Brussels", "Free University of Brussels", "Free University of Brussels", "Free University of Brussels", "BCNET, 7300 SFU ... 6B 5K3, Canada", "Univ Lyon, France", "Univ Lyon, France", "Univ Lyon, France"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0003:Yang", "Sean Goldberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldberg:Sean", "Daisy Zhe Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Daisy_Zhe", "Soumitra Siddharth Johri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johri:Soumitra_Siddharth"], "pages": 12}
