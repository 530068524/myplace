{"title": "Semiparametric Contextual Bandits.", "fields": ["martingale", "estimator", "mathematical proof", "regret", "linear function"], "abstract": "This paper studies semiparametric contextual bandits, a generalization of the linear stochastic bandit problem where the reward for an action is modeled as a linear function of known action features confounded by an non-linear action-independent term. We design new algorithms that achieve $\\tilde{O}(d\\sqrt{T})$ regret over $T$ rounds, when the linear function is $d$-dimensional, which matches the best known bounds for the simpler unconfounded case and improves on a recent result of Greenewald et al. (2017). Via an empirical evaluation, we show that our algorithms outperform prior approaches when there are non-linear confounding effects on the rewards. Technically, our algorithms use a new reward estimator inspired by doubly-robust approaches and our proofs require new concentration inequalities for self-normalized martingales.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Akshay Krishnamurthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamurthy:Akshay", "Zhiwei Steven Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Zhiwei_Steven", "Vasilis Syrgkanis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Syrgkanis:Vasilis"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
