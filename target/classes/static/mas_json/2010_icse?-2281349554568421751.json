{"title": "A search engine for finding highly relevant applications.", "fields": ["deployment environment", "recommender system", "programmer", "program analysis", "executable"], "abstract": "A fundamental problem of finding applications that are highly relevant to development tasks is the mismatch between the high-level intent reflected in the descriptions of these tasks and low-level implementation details of applications. To reduce this mismatch we created an approach called  Exemplar (EXEcutable exaMPLes ARchive)  for finding highly relevant software projects from large archives of applications. After a programmer enters a natural-language query that contains high-level concepts (e.g., MIME, data sets), Exemplar uses information retrieval and program analysis techniques to retrieve applications that implement these concepts. Our case study with 39 professional Java programmers shows that Exemplar is more effective than Sourceforge in helping programmers to quickly find highly relevant applications.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "departments": ["Accenture", "Accenture", "Accenture", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Mark Grechanik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grechanik:Mark", "Chen Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Chen", "Qing Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0003:Qing", "Collin McMillan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McMillan:Collin", "Denys Poshyvanyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poshyvanyk:Denys", "Chad M.
