Our analytical model shows that not only collective operations but also point-to-point communications influence the application's sensitivity to noise. We present a simulation toolchain that injects noise delays from traces gathered on common large-scale architectures into a LogGPS simulation and allows new insights into the scaling of applications in noisy environments. We investigate collective operations with up to 1 million processes and three applications (Sweep3D, AMG, and POP) with up to 32,000 processes.We show that the scale at which noise becomes a bottleneck is system-specific and depends on the structure of the noise. Simulations with different network speeds show that a 10x faster network does not improve application scalability. We quantify noise and conclude that our tools can be utilized to tune the noise signatures of a specific system.", "citation": "Citations (196)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "authors": ["Torsten Hoefler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoefler:Torsten", "Timo Schneider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schneider:Timo", "Andrew Lumsdaine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lumsdaine:Andrew"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2010", "pages": 11}
