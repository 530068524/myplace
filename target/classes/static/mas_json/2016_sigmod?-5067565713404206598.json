This has led to the emergence of global-scale data management and event processing. However, the Wide-Area Network (WAN) latency separating datacenters is orders of magnitude larger than typical network latencies, and this requires a reevaluation of many of the traditional design trade-offs of data management systems. Therefore, data management problems must be revisited to account for the new design space. In this tutorial, we survey recent developments in GSDM focusing on identifying fundamental challenges and advancements in addition to open research opportunities.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Faisal Nawab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nawab:Faisal", "Divyakant Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Divyakant", "Amr El Abbadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbadi:Amr_El"], "pages": 5}
