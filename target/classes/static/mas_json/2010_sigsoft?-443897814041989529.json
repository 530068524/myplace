{"title": "A study of applying a research prototype tool in industrial practice.", "fields": ["umple", "abstraction", "action research", "grounded theory", "abstraction layer"], "abstract": "Our research tool, Umple, has the objective of raising the abstraction level of programming languages by adding modeling abstractions such as UML associations, attributes and state machines. My research focuses on the syntax and semantics of state machines in Umple plus the empirical validation of Umple. The latter consists of a grounded theory study of Umple users, and action research involving the use of Umple in an industrial sitting. The grounded theory study is guiding our research and development of Umple. The action research is enlarging the pool of Umple users and contributing to the validation of Umple's approach.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa"], "authors": ["Omar Bahy Badreddin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badreddin:Omar_Bahy", "Timothy C.
