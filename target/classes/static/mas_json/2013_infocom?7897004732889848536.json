This problem has been extensively studied recently with the achievable approximation bounds progressively improved from the linear factor to logarithmic factor. It has been a major open problem whether there exists a constant-approximation approximation algorithm for maximizing the wireless network capacity under the physical interference model. In this paper, we improve the status quo for the case of linear transmission power assignment, which is widely adopted due to its advantage of energy conservation. By exploring and exploiting the rich nature of the wireless interference with the linear power assignment, we develop constant-approximation algorithms for maximizing the wireless network capacity with linear transmission power assignment under the physical interference model, in both the unidirectional mode and the bidirectional mode.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Dalian University of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Peng-Jun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Peng=Jun", "Lei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lei", "Chao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Chao", "Zhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhu", "Boliu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Boliu", "Minming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Minming"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
