{"title": "Trust-Guided Behavior Adaptation Using Case-Based Reasoning.", "fields": ["robot learning", "case based reasoning", "machine learning", "trustworthiness", "robot"], "abstract": "The addition of a robot to a team can be difficult if the human teammates do not trust the robot. This can result in underutilization or disuse of the robot, even if the robot has skills or abilities that are necessary to achieve team goals or reduce risk. To help a robot integrate itself with a human team, we present an agent algorithm that allows a robot to estimate its trustworthiness and adapt its behavior accordingly. As behavior adaptation is performed, using case-based reasoning (CBR), information about the adaptation process is stored and used to improve the efficiency of future adaptations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["United States Naval Research Laboratory", "Knexus Research ... ield, Virginia", "Knexus Research ... ield, Virginia"], "authors": ["Michael W.
