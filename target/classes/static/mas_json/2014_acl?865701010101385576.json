This includes a number of randomized and deterministic algorithms devised by converting on-line learning algorithms to batch ones, and a boostingstyle algorithm applicable in the context of structured prediction with a large number of labels. We also report the results of extensive experiments with these algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Google", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Corinna Cortes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cortes:Corinna", "Vitaly Kuznetsov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuznetsov:Vitaly", "Mehryar Mohri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohri:Mehryar"], "pages": 12}
