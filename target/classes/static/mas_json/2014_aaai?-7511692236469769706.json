The multiview affinity graph is constructed by leveraging the consistency between semantic space and multiple visual spaces. With block-diagonal constraints, we enforce the affinity matrix to be sparse such that the pairwise potential for dissimilar superpixels is close to zero. By a divide-and-conquer strategy, the optimization for learning affinity matrix is decomposed into several subproblems that can be solved in parallel. Using the neighborhood relationship between superpixels and the consistency between affinity matrix and label-confidence matrix, we infer the semantic label for each superpixel of unlabeled images by minimizing an objective whose closed form solution can be easily obtained. Experimental results on two real-world image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University"], "authors": ["Ke Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ke", "Wei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0016:Wei", "Sheng Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Sheng", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
