In this paper we motivate and present the structure of the toolbox in a tutorial and example based approach. Given its exibility and scope we believe that FIT3D represents an exciting opportunity for researchers that want to develop or test one particular method with real data without the need for extensive additional programming.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "TNO, The Hague, Netherlands"], "authors": ["Isaac Esteban.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esteban:Isaac", "Judith Dijk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dijk:Judith", "Frans C.
