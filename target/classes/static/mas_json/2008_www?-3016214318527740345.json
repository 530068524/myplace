Unfortunately, given the difficulty of searching videos, the size of the video repository also makes the discovery of new content a daunting task. In this paper, we present a novel method based upon the analysis of the entire user-video graph to provide personalized video suggestions for users. The resulting algorithm, termed Adsorption, provides a simple method to efficiently propagate preference information through a variety of graphs. We extensively test the results of the recommendations on a three month snapshot of live data from YouTube.", "citation": "Citations (442)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Shumeet Baluja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baluja:Shumeet", "Rohan Seth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seth:Rohan", "D.
