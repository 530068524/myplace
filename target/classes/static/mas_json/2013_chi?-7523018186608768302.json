{"title": "Direct space-time trajectory control for visual media editing.", "fields": ["optical flow", "painting", "animation", "spacetime", "annotation"], "abstract": "We explore the design space for using object motion trajectories to create and edit visual elements in various media across space and time. We introduce a suite of pen-based techniques that facilitate fluid stylization, annotation and editing of space-time content such as video, slide presentations and 2D animation, utilizing pressure and multi-touch input. We implemented and evaluated these techniques in DirectPaint, a system for creating free-hand painting and annotation over video.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Stephanie Santosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santosa:Stephanie", "Fanny Chevalier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chevalier:Fanny", "Ravin Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan:Ravin", "Karan Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Karan"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
