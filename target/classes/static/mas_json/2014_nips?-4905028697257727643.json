{"title": "Robust Logistic Regression and Classification.", "fields": ["logistic model tree", "logistic distribution", "robust regression", "local regression", "binary classification"], "abstract": "We consider logistic regression with arbitrary outliers in the covariate matrix. We propose a new robust logistic regression algorithm, called RoLR, that estimates the parameter through a simple linear programming procedure. We prove that RoLR is robust to a constant fraction of adversarial outliers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on estimating logistic regression model when the covariate matrix is corrupted with any performance guarantees. Besides regression, we apply RoLR to solving binary classification problems where a fraction of training samples are corrupted.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "National University of Singapore", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jiashi Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jiashi", "Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan", "Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng"], "pages": 9}
