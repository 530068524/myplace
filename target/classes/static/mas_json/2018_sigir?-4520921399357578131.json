{"title": "Dynamic Shard Cutoff Prediction for Selective Search.", "fields": ["cutoff", "information retrieval", "architecture", "shard", "ranking"], "abstract": "Selective search architectures use resource selection algorithms such as Rank-S or Taily to rank index shards and determine how many to search for a given query. Most prior research evaluated solutions by their ability to improve efficiency without significantly reducing early-precision metrics such as P@5 and NDCG@10. This paper recasts selective search as an early stage of a multi-stage retrieval architecture, which makes recall-oriented metrics more appropriate. A new algorithm is presented that predicts the number of shards that must be searched for a given query in order to meet recall-oriented goals. Decoupling shard ranking from deciding how many shards to search clarifies efficiency vs. effectiveness trade-offs, and enables them to be optimized independently. Experiments on two corpora demonstrate the value of this approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "RMIT University", "Petuum Inc., Pi ... sburgh, PA, USA"], "authors": ["Hafeezul Rahman Mohammad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohammad:Hafeezul_Rahman", "Keyang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Keyang", "Jamie Callan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Callan:Jamie", "J.
