Mondrian processes are multidimensional generalizations of Poisson processes and this connection allows us to construct multidimensional generalizations of the stick-breaking process described by Sethuraman (1994), recovering the Dirichlet process in one dimension. After introducing the Aldous-Hoover representation for jointly and separately exchangeable arrays, we show how the process can be used as a nonparametric prior distribution in Bayesian models of relational data.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University College London"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Daniel M.
