Existing generic solutions are often limited to nodes with a direct serial connection and do not provide the required efficiency for network-wide logging. Instead, this is often realized by application-specific subsystems developed for custom logging statements. In this paper, we present TinyLTS - a generic and efficient Logging and Tracing System for TinyOS. TinyLTS consists of a compiler extension that separates dynamic from static information at compile time, a declarative solution for inserting logging statements, an extensible framework for flexible storing and transmitting of logging data and a frontend for recombining dynamic and static information. Our system provides concise yet expressive programming abstractions for the developer combined with efficiency comparable to custom solutions.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Fraunhofer Society", "ETH Zurich", "University of Bonn", "Fraunhofer Society"], "authors": ["Robert Sauter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sauter:Robert", "Olga Saukh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saukh:Olga", "Oliver Frietsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frietsch:Oliver", "Pedro Jos\u00e9 Marr\u00f3n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marr=oacute=n:Pedro_Jos=eacute="], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
