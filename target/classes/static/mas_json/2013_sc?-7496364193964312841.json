We analyze the performance including the cost of IO and demonstrate the fastest (to the best of our knowledge) reported throughput using the canonical sortBenchmark on a general-purpose, production HPC resource running Lustre. By clever use of available storage and a formulation of asynchronous data transfer mechanisms, we are able to almost completely hide the computation (sorting) behind the IO latency. This latency hiding enables us to achieve comparable execution times, including the additional temporary IO required, between a large sort problem (5TB) run as a single, in-RAM sort and our out-of-core approach using 1/10th the amount of RAM. In our largest run, sorting 100TB of records using 1792 hosts, we achieved an end-to-end throughput of 1.24TB/min using our general-purpose sorter, improving on the current Daytona record holder by 65%.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Texas Advanced  ... ter, Austin, TX"], "authors": ["Hari Sundar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundar:Hari", "Dhairya Malhotra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malhotra:Dhairya", "Karl W.
