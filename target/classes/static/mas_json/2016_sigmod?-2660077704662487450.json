{"title": "Holistic Influence Maximization: Combining Scalability and Efficiency with Opinion-Aware Models.", "fields": ["heuristic", "maximization", "scalability", "greedy algorithm"], "abstract": "The steady growth of graph data from social networks has resulted in wide-spread research in finding solutions to the influence maximization problem. In this paper, we propose a holistic solution to the influence maximization (IM) problem. (1) We introduce an opinion-cum-interaction (OI) model that closely mirrors the real-world scenarios. Under the OI model, we introduce a novel problem of Maximizing the Effective Opinion (MEO) of influenced users. We prove that the MEO problem is NP-hard and cannot be approximated within a constant ratio unless P=NP. (2) We propose a heuristic algorithm OSIM to efficiently solve the MEO problem. To better explain the OSIM heuristic, we first introduce EaSyIM - the opinion-oblivious version of OSIM, a scalable algorithm capable of running within practical compute times on commodity hardware. In addition to serving as a fundamental building block for OSIM, EaSyIM is capable of addressing the scalability aspect - memory consumption and running time, of the IM problem as well. Empirically, our algorithms are capable of maintaining the deviation in the spread always within 5% of the best known methods in the literature. In addition, our experiments show that both OSIM and EaSyIM are effective, efficient, scalable and significantly enhance the ability to analyze real datasets.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Xerox", "Xerox", "Xerox"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Sainyam Galhotra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galhotra:Sainyam", "Akhil Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora_0001:Akhil", "Shourya Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Shourya"], "pages": 16}
