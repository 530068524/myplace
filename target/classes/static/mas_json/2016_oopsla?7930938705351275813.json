{"title": "OrcO: a concurrency-first approach to objects.", "fields": ["object composition", "abstraction", "programming language", "concurrency", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "The majority of modern programming languages provide concurrency and object-orientation in some form. However, object-oriented concurrency remains cumbersome in many situations. We introduce the language OrcO, Orc with concurrent Objects, which enables a flexible style of concurrent object-oriented programming. OrcO extends the Orc programming language by adding abstractions for programming-in-the-large; namely objects, classes, and inheritance. OrcO objects are designed to be orthogonal to concurrency, allowing the concurrent structure and object structure of a program to evolve independently. This paper describes OrcO's goals and design and provides examples of how OrcO can be used to deftly handle events, object management, and object composition.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Google", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Arthur Michener Peters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peters:Arthur_Michener", "David Kitchin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kitchin:David", "John A.
