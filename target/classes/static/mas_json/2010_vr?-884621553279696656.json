Interactive 3D lenses, often called volumetric lenses, provide users with alternative views of datasets within spatially bounded regions of interest (focus) while maintaining the surrounding overview (context). In contrast to previous multi-pass rendering work, we discuss the strengths, limitations, and performance cost of a single-pass technique. For a substantial range of effects, it supports several interactive composable lenses at interactive frame rates without performance loss during increasing lens intersections or manipulations. Other cases, for which this performance cannot be achieved, are also discussed. Finally, we illustrate possible applications of our lens system, especially new Time Warp lenses for exploring time-varying datasets in interactive VR.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "University of Louisiana at Lafayette"], "authors": ["Jan-Phillip Tiesel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiesel:Jan=Phillip", "Christoph W.
