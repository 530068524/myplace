Various work for discovering interpolants for propositional logic, quantifier-free fragments of first-order theories and their combinations have been proposed. However, little work focuses on discovering polynomial interpolants in the literature. In this paper, we provide an approach for constructing non-linear interpolants based on semidefinite programming, and show how to apply such results to the verification of programs by examples.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "State Key Labor ... re, CAS, China"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Liyun Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Liyun", "Bican Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Bican", "Naijun Zhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhan:Naijun"], "pages": 17}
