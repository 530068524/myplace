{"title": "A case for faster mobile web in cellular IPv6 networks.", "fields": ["mobile web", "ipv6", "ipv4", "server", "mobile search"], "abstract": "The transition to IPv6 cellular networks creates uncertainty for content providers (CPs) and content delivery networks (CDNs) of whether and how to follow suit. Do CPs that update their CDN contracts to allow IPv6 hosting achieve better, or worse performance in mobile networks? Should CDNs continue to host mobile content over IPv4 networks, or persuade to their CP customers the performance benefits of IPv6 content delivery?   In this paper we answer these questions through a comprehensive comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 mobile Web performance in cellular networks in the US from the point of view of Akamai's content delivery infrastructure. Our data show that IPv6 hosting outperforms legacy IPv4 paths in mobile Web. Our analysis leads to clear recommendations for CPs to transition to IPv6-hosted mobile Web. Finally, we propose new mechanisms, through which CDNs can safely transition mobile content to IPv6-enabled servers for improved content delivery.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Montana State University", "Akamai Technologies", "Montana State University", "Akamai Technologies", "Akamai Technologies"], "authors": ["Utkarsh Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Utkarsh", "Moritz Steiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steiner:Moritz", "Mike P.
