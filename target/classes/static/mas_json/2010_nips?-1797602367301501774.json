{"title": "Scrambled Objects for Least-Squares Regression.", "fields": ["linear combination", "sobolev space", "basis function", "smoothness", "function space"], "abstract": "We consider least-squares regression using a randomly generated subspace GP \u2282 F of finite dimension P, where F is a function space of infinite dimension, e.g. L2([0, 1]d). GP is defined as the span of P random features that are linear combinations of the basis functions of F weighted by random Gaussian i.i.d. coefficients. In particular, we consider multi-resolution random combinations at all scales of a given mother function, such as a hat function or a wavelet. In this latter case, the resulting Gaussian objects are called scrambled wavelets and we show that they enable to approximate functions in Sobolev spaces Hs([0, l]d). As a result, given N data, the least-squares estimate \u011d built from P scrambled wavelets has excess risk \u2016f* - \u011d\u20162P = O(\u2016f*\u20162Hs([0,1]d)(log N)/P + P(log N)/N) for target functions f* \u2208 Hs ([0,1]d) of smoothness order s > d/2. An interesting aspect of the resulting bounds is that they do not depend on the distribution P from which the data are generated, which is important in a statistical regression setting considered here. Randomization enables to adapt to any possible distribution.\n\nWe conclude by describing an efficient numerical implementation using lazy expansions with numerical complexity O(2dN3/2 log N + N2), where d is the dimension of the input space.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Odalric-Ambrym Maillard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maillard:Odalric=Ambrym", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
