The properties of interest are expressed using bounded linear temporal logic. The various features of the tool including automatic monitor generation for producing execution traces of the model-under-verification, mechanism for automatically instrumenting the model, and the interaction with statistical model checker are presented.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Van Chan Ngo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ngo:Van_Chan", "Axel Legay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Legay:Axel", "Vania Joloboff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joloboff:Vania"], "pages": 8}
