{"title": "Restore truncation for performance improvement in future DRAM systems.", "fields": ["dram", "scaling", "bit cell", "performance improvement", "truncation"], "abstract": "Scaling DRAM below 20nm has become a major challenge due to intrinsic limitations in the structure of a bit cell. Future DRAM chips are likely to suffer from significant variations and degraded timings, such as taking much more time to restore cell data after read and write access. In this paper, we propose restore truncation (RT), a low-cost restore strategy to improve performance of DRAM modules that adopt relaxed restore timing. After an access, RT restores a bit cell's voltage only to the level required to persist data to the next scheduled refresh rather than to the default full voltage. Because restore time is shortened, the performance of the cell is improved under process variations. We devise two schemes to balance performance, energy consumption, and hardware overhead. We simulate our proposed RT schemes and compare them with the state of the art. Experimental results show that, on average, RT improves performance by 19.5% and reduces energy consumption by 17%.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh", "University of Pittsburgh"], "authors": ["XianWei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:XianWei", "Youtao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Youtao", "Bruce R.
