{"title": "Polarity and the Logic of Delimited Continuations.", "fields": ["delimited continuation", "monad", "continuation passing style", "operator", "proof theory"], "abstract": "Polarized logic is the logic of values and continuations, and their interaction through continuation-passing style. The main limitations of this logic are the limitations of CPS: that continuations cannot be composed, and that programs are fully sequentialized. Delimited control operators were invented in response to the limitations of classical continuation-passing. That suggests the question: what is the logic of delimited continuations? We offer a simple account of delimited control, through a natural generalization of the classical notion of polarity. This amounts to breaking the perfect symmetry between positive and negative polarity in the following way: answer types are positive. Despite this asymmetry, we retain all of the classical polarized connectives, and can explain \"intuitionistic polarity'' (e.g., in systems like CBPV) as a restriction on the use of connectives, i.e., as a logical fragment. Our analysis complements and generalizes existing accounts of delimited control operators, while giving us a rich logical language through which to understand the interaction of control with monadic effects.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Univ.
