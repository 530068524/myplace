{"title": "When poll is better than interrupt.", "fields": ["interrupt", "latency", "real time computing", "parallel computing", "polling"], "abstract": "In a traditional block I/O path, the operating system completes virtually all I/Os asynchronously via interrupts. However, performing storage I/O with ultra-low latency devices using next-generation non-volatile memory, it can be shown that polling for the completion - hence wasting clock cycles during the I/O - delivers higher performance than traditional interrupt-driven I/O. This paper thus argues for the synchronous completion of block I/O first by presenting strong empirical evidence showing a stack latency advantage, second by delineating limits with the current interrupt-driven path, and third by proving that synchronous completion is indeed safe and correct. This paper further discusses challenges and opportunities introduced by synchronous I/O completion model for both operating system kernels and user applications.", "citation": "Citations (142)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Jisoo Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jisoo", "Dave B.
