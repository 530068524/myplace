We present Magic Mirror, a virtual fashion consultant, which can parse, appreciate and recommend the wearing. Magic Mirror is designed with a large display and Kinect to simulate the real mirror and interact with users in augmented reality. Internally, Magic Mirror is a practical appreciation system for automatic aesthetics-oriented clothing analysis. Specifically, we focus on the clothing collocation rather than the single one, the style (aesthetic words) rather than the visual features. We bridge the gap between the visual features and aesthetic words of clothing collocation to enable the computer to learn appreciating the clothing collocation. Finally, both object and subject evaluations verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and Magic Mirror system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yejun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yejun", "Jia Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia_0001:Jia", "Jingtian Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Jingtian", "Yihui Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Yihui", "Jie Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jie", "Zijian Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Zijian"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
