A knowledge market framing allows site operators to reason about market failures, and to design policies to prevent them. Our goal is to provide insights on large-scale knowledge market failures through an interpretable model. We explore a set of interpretable economic production models on a large empirical dataset to analyze the dynamics of content generation in knowledge markets. Amongst these, the Cobb-Douglas model best explains empirical data and provides an intuitive explanation for content generation through concepts of elasticity and diminishing returns. Content generation depends on user participation and also on how specific types of content (e.g. answers) depends on other types (e.g. questions). We show that these factors of content generation have constant elasticity\u2014a percentage increase in any of the inputs leads to a constant percentage increase in the output. Furthermore, markets exhibit diminishing returns\u2014the marginal output decreases as the input is incrementally increased. Knowledge markets also vary on their returns to scale\u2014the increase in output resulting from a proportionate increase in all inputs. Importantly, many knowledge markets exhibit diseconomies of scale\u2014measures of market health (e.g., the percentage of questions with an accepted answer) decrease as a function of number of participants. The implications of our work are two-fold: site operators ought to design incentives as a function of system size (number of participants); the market lens should shed insight into complex dependencies amongst different content types and participant actions in general social networks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Google", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Peking University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Himel Dev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dev:Himel", "Chase Geigle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geigle:Chase", "Qingtao Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Qingtao", "Jiahui Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Jiahui", "Hari Sundaram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundaram:Hari"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
