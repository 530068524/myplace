It adopts the data-as-a-service (DaaS) model, where the LBS provider publishes its data to a third party (e.g., cloud server) who executes users' LBS queries. The pro- posed FINE framework employs a ciphertext-policy anonymous attribute-based encryption technique to achieve fine-grained access control, location privacy, confidentiality of the LBS data and its access policy, and accurate LBS query result while without involving any trusted third party. Moreover, the proposed FINE framework also integrates the transformation key and proxy re- encryption to migrate most of computation-intensive tasks from the LBS provider and users to the cloud server. This property keeps mobile devices away from massive resource-consuming operations. Extensive analysis shows that our proposed FINE framework is secure and highly efficient for mobile devices in terms of computation and communication cost.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "departments": ["Zhejiang Gongshang University", "Nanyang Technological University", "University of Ontario Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jun Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Jun", "Rongxing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Rongxing", "Xiaodong Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xiaodong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
