{"title": "Rubah: DSU for Java on a stock JVM.", "fields": ["dynamic software updating", "programmer", "thread", "bytecode", "quake"], "abstract": "This paper presents Rubah, the first  dynamic software updating  system for Java that: is  portable , implemented via libraries and bytecode rewriting on top of a standard JVM; is  efficient , imposing essentially no overhead on normal, steady-state execution; is  flexible , allowing nearly arbitrary changes to classes between updates; and is non-disruptive , employing either a novel eager algorithm that transforms the program state with multiple threads, or a novel lazy algorithm that transforms objects as they are demanded, post-update. Requiring little programmer effort, Rubah has been used to dynamically update five long-running applications: the H2 database, the Voldemort key-value store, the Jake2 implementation of the Quake 2 shooter game, the CrossFTP server, and the JavaEmailServer.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Lu\u00eds Pina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pina:Lu=iacute=s", "Lu\u00eds Veiga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veiga:Lu=iacute=s", "Michael W.
