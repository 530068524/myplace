An interesting operator on hyperspheres called  dominance  is to decide for two given hyperspheres whether one  dominates  (or  is closer than ) the other wrt a given query hypersphere. In this paper, we propose an approach called  Hyperbola  which is  optimal  in the sense that it gives neither false positives nor false negatives and runs in linear time wrt the dimensionality. To the best of our knowledge,  Hyperbola  is the first optimal approach for the dominance problem on hyperespheres with any dimensionality. We also study an application of the dominance problem which relies on the dominance operator as the core component. We conducted extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets which verified our approaches.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Cheng Long.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Long:Cheng", "Raymond Chi-Wing Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Raymond_Chi=Wing", "Bin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Bin", "Min Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Min"], "pages": 12}
