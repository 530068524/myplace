{"title": "Goals and perceived success of online enterprise communities: what is important to leaders & members?", "fields": ["management science", "computer science", "reuse", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "Online communities are successful only if they achieve their goals, but there has been little direct study of goals. We analyze novel data characterizing the goals of enterprise online communities, assessing the importance of goals for leaders, how goals influence member perceptions of community value, and how goals relate to success measures proposed in the literature. We find that most communities have multiple goals and common goals are learning, reuse of resources, collaboration, networking, influencing change, and innovation. Leaders and members agree that all of these goals are important, but their perceptions of success on goals do not align with each other, or with commonly used behavioral success measures. We conclude that simple behavioral measures and leader perceptions are not good success metrics, and propose alternatives based on specific goals members and leaders judge most important.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "IBM", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tara Matthews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthews:Tara", "Jilin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jilin", "Steve Whittaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittaker:Steve", "Aditya Pal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pal:Aditya", "Haiyi Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Haiyi", "Hernan Badenes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badenes:Hernan", "Barton A.
