Recently, empirical studies suggested that identity skip-connections enable ensemble-like behaviour of shallow networks, and that depth is not a solo ingredient for their success. Therefore, we examine the potential of identity skip-connections for the task of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) where  moderately  deep temporal architectures are often employed. To this end, we propose a novel architecture which regulates unimpeded feature flows and captures long-term dependencies via gate-based skip-connections and a memory mechanism. Our proposed architecture is compared to other state-of-the-art methods of SER and is evaluated on large aggregated corpora recorded in different contexts. Our proposed architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 9 - 15% and achieves an Unweighted Accuracy of 80.5% in an imbalanced class distribution. In addition, we examine a variant adopting simplified skip-connections of Residual Networks (ResNet) and show that gate-based skip-connections are more effective than simplified skip-connections.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Twente", "University of Twente", "University of Twente", "University of Twente"], "authors": ["Jaebok Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jaebok", "Gwenn Englebienne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Englebienne:Gwenn", "Khiet P.
