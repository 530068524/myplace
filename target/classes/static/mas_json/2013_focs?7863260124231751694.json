The algorithm runs in O(n d/2 ) time for any constant d \u2265 3. Although it improves the previous best algorithm by \u201cjust\u201d an iterated logarithmic factor, the real surprise lies in the simplicity of the new algorithm. We also show that it is theoretically possible to beat the O(n d/2 ) time bound by logarithmic factors for integer input in the word RAM model, and for other variants of the problem. With additional work, we obtain an O(n d/3  polylog n)-time algorithm for the important special case of orthants or unit hypercubes (which include the so-called \u201chypervolume indicator problem\u201d), and an O(n (d+1)/3  polylog n)-time algorithm for the case of arbitrary hypercubes or fat boxes, improving a previous O(n( d+2)/3) -time algorithm by Bringmann.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Waterloo"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Timothy M.
