We propose a matrix factorization approach to analyze the location relevance for each news document. We also propose a method to enrich the document with a set of web images. For location relevance analysis, we first perform toponym extraction and expansion to obtain a toponym list from news documents. We then propose a matrix factorization method to estimate the location-document relevance scores while simultaneously capturing the correlation of locations and documents. For image enrichment, we propose a method to generate multiple queries from each news document for image search and then employ an intelligent fusion approach to collect a set of images from the search results. Based on the location relevance analysis and image enrichment, we introduce a news browsing system named NewsMap which can support users in reading news via browsing a map and retrieving news with location queries. The news documents with the corresponding enriched images are presented to help users quickly get information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "National University of Singapore", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Zechao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zechao", "Meng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Meng", "Jing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Jing", "Changsheng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Changsheng", "Hanqing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hanqing"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
