{"title": "Using String Distances for Test Case Prioritisation.", "fields": ["hamming distance", "test case", "test suite", "random permutation", "string"], "abstract": "Test case prioritisation aims at finding an ordering which enhances a certain property of an ordered test suite. Traditional techniques rely on the availability of code or a specification of the program under test. In this paper, we propose to use string distances on the text of test cases for their comparison and elaborate a prioritisation algorithm. Such a prioritisation does not require code and can be useful for initial testing and in cases when code is difficult to instrument. We also briefly report on preliminary results of an experiment where the proposed prioritisation technique was compared with random permutations and four classical string distance metrics were evaluated.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Grenoble", "Centre de Rech. ... eal, QC, Canada", "Centre de Rech. ... eal, QC, Canada"], "authors": ["Yves Ledru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ledru:Yves", "Alexandre Petrenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrenko:Alexandre", "Sergiy Boroday.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boroday:Sergiy"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
