{"title": "Minimal MapReduce algorithms.", "fields": ["data mining", "theoretical computer science", "distributed computing", "big data", "load balancing"], "abstract": "MapReduce has become a dominant parallel computing paradigm for  big data , i.e., colossal datasets at the scale of tera-bytes or higher. Ideally, a MapReduce system should achieve a high degree of load balancing among the participating machines, and minimize the space usage, CPU and I/O time, and network transfer at each machine. Although these principles have guided the development of MapReduce algorithms, limited emphasis has been placed on enforcing serious constraints on the aforementioned metrics simultaneously. This paper presents the notion of  minimal algorithm , that is, an algorithm that guarantees the best parallelization in multiple aspects at the same time, up to a small constant factor. We show the existence of elegant minimal algorithms for a set of fundamental database problems, and demonstrate their excellent performance with extensive experiments.", "citation": "Citations (65)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei", "Wenqing Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Wenqing", "Xiaokui Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Xiaokui"], "pages": 12}
