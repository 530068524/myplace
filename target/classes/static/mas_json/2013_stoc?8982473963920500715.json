We show that, given a matrix A \u2208 R n x d  with n >> d and a p \u2208 [1, 2), with a constant probability, we can construct a low-distortion embedding matrix \u03a0 \u2208 R O(poly(d)) x n  that embeds A p , the l p  subspace spanned by A's columns, into (R O(poly(d)) , |~cdot~| p ); the distortion of our embeddings is only O(poly(d)), and we can compute \u03a0 A in O(nnz(A)) time, i.e., input-sparsity time. Our result generalizes the input-sparsity time l 2  subspace embedding by Clarkson and Woodruff [STOC'13]; and for completeness, we present a simpler and improved analysis of their construction for l 2 . These input-sparsity time l p  embeddings are optimal, up to constants, in terms of their running time; and the improved running time propagates to applications such as (1 pm e)-distortion l p  subspace embedding and relative-error l p  regression. For l 2 , we show that a (1+e)-approximate solution to the l 2  regression problem specified by the matrix A and a vector b \u2208 R n  can be computed in O(nnz(A) + d 3  log(d/e) /e^2) time; and for l p , via a subspace-preserving sampling procedure, we show that a (1 pm e)-distortion embedding of A p  into R O(poly(d))  can be computed in O(nnz(A) \u22c5 log n) time, and we also show that a (1+e)-approximate solution to the l p  regression problem min x \u2208 R d   |A x - b| p  can be computed in O(nnz(A) \u22c5 log n + poly(d) log(1/e)/e 2 ) time. Moreover, we can also improve the embedding dimension or equivalently the sample size to O(d 3+p/2  log(1/e) / e 2 ) without increasing the complexity.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["LinkedIn", "Stanford University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Xiangrui Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Xiangrui", "Michael W.
