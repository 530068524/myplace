This tutorial briefly reviews the Datalog language and recursive query processing and optimization techniques, then discusses applications of Datalog in three application domains: data integration, declarative networking, and program analysis. Throughout the tutorial, we use LogicBlox, a commercial Datalog engine for enterprise software systems, to allow the audience to walk through code examples presented in the tutorial.", "citation": "Citations (112)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of Pennsylvania", "LogicBlox, Inc. ... tlanta, GA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Shan Shan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Shan_Shan", "Todd Jeffrey Green.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Green:Todd_Jeffrey", "Boon Thau Loo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loo:Boon_Thau"], "pages": 4}
