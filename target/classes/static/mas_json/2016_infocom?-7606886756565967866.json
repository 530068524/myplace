{"title": "OPTAS: Decentralized flow monitoring and scheduling for tiny tasks.", "fields": ["fixed priority pre emptive scheduling", "testbed", "round trip delay time", "linux kernel", "fifo"], "abstract": "Task-aware flow schedulers collect task information across the data center to optimize task-level performance. However, the majority of the tasks, which generate short flows and are called tiny tasks, have been largely overlooked by current schedulers. The large number of tiny tasks brings significant overhead to the centralized schedulers, while the existing decentralized schedulers are too complex to fit in commodity switches. In this paper we present OPTAS, a lightweight, commodity-switch-compatible scheduling solution that efficiently monitors and schedules flows for tiny tasks with low overhead. OPTAS monitors system calls and buffer footprints to recognize the tiny tasks, and assigns them with higher priorities than larger ones. The tiny tasks are then transferred in a FIFO manner by adjusting two attributes, namely, the window size and round trip time, of TCP. We have implemented OPTAS as a Linux kernel module, and experiments on our 37-server testbed show that OPTAS is at least 2.2\u00d7 faster than fair sharing, and 1.2\u00d7 faster than only assigning tiny tasks with the highest priority.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Ziyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ziyang", "Yiming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yiming", "Dongsheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dongsheng", "Kai Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0005:Kai", "Yuxing Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Yuxing"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
