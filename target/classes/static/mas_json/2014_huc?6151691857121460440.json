This paper presents BioScope, an extensible sensing system that facilitates collecting data used in nursing assessments. We conducted experiments to demonstrate the potential of the system. The results obtained in this study can be applied in improving the design, thus enabling BioScope to facilitate data collection in numerous potential applications.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Cheng-Yuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Cheng=Yuan", "Chi-Hsien Yen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yen:Chi=Hsien", "Kuo-Chen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Kuo=Chen", "Chuang-Wen You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Chuang=Wen", "Seng-Yong Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Seng=Yong", "Cheryl Chia-Hui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Cheryl_Chia=Hui", "Polly Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Polly", "Hao-Hua Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Hao=Hua"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
