This involves convolution of the listener's head-related transfer function (HRTF) with the RIR to generate a spatial room impulse response (SRIR) which can be used to auralize the sound entering the listener's ear canals. Previous approaches tend to evaluate the HRTF for each sound propagation path, though this is too slow for interactive VR latency requirements. We present a new technique for computation of the SRIR that performs the convolution with the HRTF in the spherical harmonic (SH) domain for RIR partitions of a fixed length. The main contribution is a novel perceptually driven metric that adaptively determines the lowest SH order required for each partition to result in no perceptible error in the SRIR. By using lower SH order for some partitions, our technique saves a significant amount of computation and is almost an order of m...", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "authors": ["Carl Schissler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schissler:Carl", "Peter Stirling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stirling:Peter", "Ravish Mehra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehra:Ravish"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
