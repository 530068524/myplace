This paper formalizes predicate abstraction and counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) for higher-order model checking, enabling automatic verification of programs that use  infinite  data domains such as integers. A prototype verifier for higher-order functional programs based on the formalization has been implemented and tested for several programs.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "departments": ["Tohoku University", "Tohoku University", "Tohoku University"], "authors": ["Naoki Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi_0001:Naoki", "Ryosuke Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Ryosuke", "Hiroshi Unno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unno_0001:Hiroshi"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
