We present Pursuits, an innovative interaction technique that enables truly spontaneous interaction with eye-based interfaces. A user can simply walk up to the screen and readily interact with moving targets. Instead of being based on gaze location, Pursuits correlates eye pursuit movements with objects dynamically moving on the interface. We evaluate the influence of target speed, number and trajectory and develop guidelines for designing Pursuits-based interfaces. We then describe six realistic usage scenarios and implement three of them to evaluate the method in a usability study and a field study. Our results show that Pursuits is a versatile and robust technique and that users can interact with Pursuits-based interfaces without prior knowledge or preparation phase.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Max Planck Society", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["M\u00e9lodie Vidal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidal:M=eacute=lodie", "Andreas Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Andreas", "Hans Gellersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gellersen:Hans"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
