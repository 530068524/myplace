{"title": "Compatibility testing using patterns-based trace comparison.", "fields": ["software development", "compatibility testing", "observable", "software system", "usb"], "abstract": "When composing a system from components, we need to ensure that the components are compatible. This is commonly achieved by components interacting only via published and well-defined interfaces. Even so, it is possible for client components to learn about and depend on unpublished yet observable behaviors of components. To identify and support these situations, compatibility testing should uncover such observable behaviors.   As a solution, we propose a patterns-based approach to test compatibility between programs in terms of their observable behaviors. The approach compares traces of behaviors observed at identical published interfaces of programs and detects incompatibilities stemming from both the presence of previously unobserved behaviors and the absence of previously observed behaviors. The traces are compared by transforming them into sets of structural and binary linear temporal patterns.   During Windows 8 development cycle, we applied this approach to test compatibility between USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 bus drivers. Upon testing 14 USB 2.0 devices that were functioning without errors with both USB bus drivers, we uncovered 25 previously unknown incompatibilities between the bus drivers.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Kansas State University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Venkatesh-Prasad Ranganath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranganath:Venkatesh=Prasad", "Pradip Vallathol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vallathol:Pradip", "Pankaj Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Pankaj"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
