{"title": "SignalSense: towards quality service.", "fields": ["signal strength", "user experience design", "mobile web", "mobile technology", "mobile search"], "abstract": "The craving to remain \"connected\" has exploded since mobile phones became popular a few decades ago and are now fully entrenched in our lives as we become more and more dependent on connected services for professional, daily and social needs. Despite the significant demand from consumers and the push towards improved mobile technologies, many services delivered to the average consumer exhibit poor performance and quality.   In this paper, we propose SignalSense, a highly interactive and novel mobile application that senses and records real-time mobile and wifi signal strength and quality for indoor/outdoor mapping. The application also uses mobile sensing to crowd-source signal information and intelligently combines them with geo-location data to make recommendations to users, leading to improved user experience. Initial evaluation demonstrates the need for such an application.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of East London", "University of East London", "University of East London", "University of East London"], "authors": ["Syed Islam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Islam:Syed", "Mhd Saeed Sharif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharif:Mhd_Saeed", "Usman Naeem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naeem:Usman", "James Geehan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geehan:James"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
