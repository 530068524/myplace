{"title": "SEESAW: Using Superpages to Improve VIPT Caches.", "fields": ["virtual memory", "offset", "page", "boosting", "seesaw molecular geometry"], "abstract": "Hardware caches balance fast lookup, high hit rates, energy efficiency, and simplicity of implementation. For L1 caches however, achieving this balance is difficult because of constraints imposed by virtual memory. L1 caches are usually virtually-indexed and physically tagged (VIPT), but this means that they must be highly associative to achieve good capacity. Unfortunately, excessive associativity compromises performance by degrading access times without significantly boosting hit rates, and increases access energy.   We propose S eesaw  to overcome this problem. S eesaw  leverages the increasing ubiquity of superpages 1  - since super-pages have more page offset bits, they can accommodate VIPT caches with more sets than what is traditionally possible with only base page sizes. S eesaw  dynamically reduces the number of ways that are looked up based on the page size, improving performance and energy. S eesaw  requires modest hardware and no OS or application changes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Rutgers University", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Mayank Parasar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parasar:Mayank", "Abhishek Bhattacharjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhattacharjee:Abhishek", "Tushar Krishna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishna:Tushar"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2018", "pages": 14}
