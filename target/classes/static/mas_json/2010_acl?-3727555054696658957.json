In this paper, we formulate extractive summarization as a two step learning problem building a generative model for pattern discovery and a regression model for inference. We calculate scores for sentences in document clusters based on their latent characteristics using a hierarchical topic model. Then, using these scores, we train a regression model based on the lexical and structural characteristics of the sentences, and use the model to score sentences of new documents to form a summary. Our system advances current state-of-the-art improving ROUGE scores by ~7%. Generated summaries are less redundant and more coherent based upon manual quality evaluations.", "citation": "Citations (141)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "International Computer Science Institute"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Asli \u00c7elikyilmaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ccedil=elikyilmaz:Asli", "Dilek Hakkani-T\u00fcr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hakkani=T=uuml=r:Dilek"], "pages": 10}
