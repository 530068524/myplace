To alleviate this issue, we propose to utilize the object correspondences in successive frames as weak supervision to adapt visual recognition models, which is particularly suitable for human profile recognition. Specifically, we substantialize this new strategy on an advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) based system to estimate human gender, age, and race. We enforce the system to output consistent and stable results on face images from the same trajectories in videos by using incremental stochastic training. Our baseline system already achieves competitive performance on gender and age estimation as compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms on the FG-NET database. Further, on two new video datasets containing about 900 persons, the proposed supervision of correspondences improves the estimation accuracy by a large margin over the baseline.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Huawei", "NEC Laboratorie ... rtino, CA 95014", "NEC Laboratorie ... rtino, CA 95014", "NEC Laboratorie ... rtino, CA 95014"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ming Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ming", "Shenghuo Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Shenghuo", "Fengjun Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Fengjun", "Kai Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Kai"], "pages": 8}
