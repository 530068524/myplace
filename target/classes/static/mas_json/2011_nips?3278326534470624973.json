{"title": "TD_gamma: Re-evaluating Complex Backups in Temporal Difference Learning.", "fields": ["machine learning", "maximum likelihood", "estimator", "spacetime", "temporal difference learning"], "abstract": "We show that the \u03bb-return target used in the TD(\u03bb) family of algorithms is the maximum likelihood estimator for a specific model of how the variance of an n-step return estimate increases with n. We introduce the \u03b3-return estimator, an alternative target based on a more accurate model of variance, which defines the TD\u03b3 family of complex-backup temporal difference learning algorithms. We derive TD\u03b3, the \u03b3-return equivalent of the original TD(\u03bb) algorithm, which eliminates the \u03bb parameter but can only perform updates at the end of an episode and requires time and space proportional to the episode length. We then derive a second algorithm, TD\u03b3(C), with a capacity parameter C. TD\u03b3(C) requires C times more time and memory than TD(\u03bb) and is incremental and online. We show that TD\u03b3 outperforms TD(\u03bb) for any setting of \u03bb on 4 out of 5 benchmark domains, and that TD\u03b3(C) performs as well as or better than TD\u03b3 for intermediate settings of C.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["George Konidaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konidaris:George", "Scott Niekum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niekum:Scott", "Philip S.
