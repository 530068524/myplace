{"title": "A Generalized-Zero-Preserving Method for Compact Encoding of Concept Lattices.", "fields": ["bit field", "null vector", "unification", "constraint satisfaction problem", "bit array"], "abstract": "Constructing an encoding of a concept lattice using short bit vectors allows for efficient computation of join operations on the lattice. Join is the central operation any unification-based parser must support. We extend the traditional bit vector encoding, which represents join failure using the zero vector, to count any vector with less than a fixed number of one bits as failure. This allows non-joinable elements to share bits, resulting in a smaller vector size. A constraint solver is used to construct the encoding, and a variety of techniques are employed to find near-optimal solutions and handle timeouts. An evaluation is provided comparing the extended representation of failure with traditional bit vector techniques.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Matthew Skala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skala:Matthew", "Victoria Krakovna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krakovna:Victoria", "J\u00e1nos Kram\u00e1r.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kram=aacute=r:J=aacute=nos", "Gerald Penn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Penn:Gerald"], "pages": 10}
