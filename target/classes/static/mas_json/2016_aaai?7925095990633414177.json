{"title": "Continual Planning in Golog.", "fields": ["situation calculus", "artificial intelligence", "planning domain definition language", "mobile robot", "machine learning"], "abstract": "To solve ever more complex and longer tasks, mobile robots need to generate more elaborate plans and must handle dynamic environments and incomplete knowledge. We address this challenge by integrating two seemingly different approaches \u2013 PDDL-based planning for efficient plan generation and GOLOG for highly expressive behavior specification \u2013 in a coherent framework that supports continual planning. The latter allows to interleave plan generation and execution through assertions, which are placeholder actions that are dynamically expanded into conditional sub-plans (using classical planners) once a replanning condition is satisfied. We formalize and implement continual planning in GOLOG which was so far only supported in PDDL-based systems. This enables combining the execution of generated plans with regular GOLOG programs and execution monitoring. Experiments on autonomous mobile robots show that the approach supports expressive behavior specification combined with efficient sub-plan generation to handle dynamic environments and incomplete knowledge in a unified way.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Till Hofmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofmann:Till", "Tim Niemueller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niemueller:Tim", "Jens Cla\u00dfen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cla=szlig=en:Jens", "Gerhard Lakemeyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lakemeyer:Gerhard"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
