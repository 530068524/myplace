In addition to traditional survey-based data, this work focuses on social networks derived from real-life data gathered through smartphones. Besides showing that the latter are superior to the former for the task at hand, our results provide a fine-grained analysis of the contribution the various feature sets are able to provide to personality classification, along with an assessment of the relative merits of the various networks exploited.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Trento", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "fondazione bruno kessler", "University of Trento"], "authors": ["Jacopo Staiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Staiano:Jacopo", "Bruno Lepri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepri:Bruno", "Nadav Aharony.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aharony:Nadav", "Fabio Pianesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pianesi:Fabio", "Nicu Sebe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebe:Nicu", "Alex Pentland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pentland:Alex"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
