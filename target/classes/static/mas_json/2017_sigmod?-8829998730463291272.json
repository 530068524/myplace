{"title": "The BUDS Language for Distributed Bayesian Machine Learning.", "fields": ["declarative programming", "implementation", "abstraction", "hadamard transform", "compiler"], "abstract": "We describe BUDS, a declarative language for succinctly and simply specifying the implementation of large-scale machine learning algorithms on a distributed computing platform. The types supported in BUDS--vectors, arrays, etc.--are simply logical abstractions useful for programming, and do not correspond to the actual implementation. In fact, BUDS automatically chooses the physical realization of these abstractions in a distributed system, by taking into account the characteristics of the data. Likewise, there are many available implementations of the abstract operations offered by BUDS (matrix multiplies, transposes, Hadamard products, etc.). These are tightly coupled with the physical representation. In BUDS, these implementations are co-optimized along with the representation. All of this allows for the BUDS compiler to automatically perform deep optimizations of the user's program, and automatically generate efficient implementations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Zekai J.
