{"title": "FD-MMAC: Combating multi-channel hidden and exposed terminals using a single transceiver.", "fields": ["spectral efficiency", "transceiver", "universal software radio peripheral", "error vector magnitude", "hidden node problem"], "abstract": "We address the problem of improving the throughput and delay efficiency of distributed multi-channel MAC (MMAC) protocols. We design an MMAC protocol called FD-MMAC that exploits recent advances in full-duplex (FD) communications to coordinate channel access in a distributed manner. Compared with prior MMAC designs, the FD-MMAC protocol eliminates the use of in-band or out-of-band control channels for combat- ing the multi-channel hidden terminal problem, discovering the resident channel of destinations, and performing load balancing. Furthermore, FD-MMAC improves the spectral efficiency by enabling the operation of multi-channel exposed terminals. To achieve its goals, FD-MMAC integrates an advanced suite of PHY-layer techniques, including self interference suppression, error vector magnitude and received power measurements, and signal correlation techniques. We validate the proposed PHY-layer techniques on NI USRP devices. Further, we show via simulations that FD-MMAC achieves significantly higher throughput and lower delay compared with prior art.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "University of Arizona"], "authors": ["Yan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0019:Yan", "Loukas Lazos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazos:Loukas", "Kai Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0022:Kai", "Bocan Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Bocan", "Swetha Shivaramaiah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shivaramaiah:Swetha"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
