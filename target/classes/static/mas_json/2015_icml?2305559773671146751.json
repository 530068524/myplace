{"title": "A Unified Framework for Outlier-Robust PCA-like Algorithms.", "fields": ["bounded function", "sparse pca", "machine learning", "data model", "outlier"], "abstract": "We propose a unified framework for making a wide range of PCA-like algorithms - including the standard PCA, sparse PCA and non-negative sparse PCA, etc. - robust when facing a constant fraction of arbitrarily corrupted outliers. Our analysis establishes solid performance guarantees of the proposed framework: its estimation error is upper bounded by a term depending on the intrinsic parameters of the data model, the selected PCA-like algorithm and the fraction of outliers. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the outlier-robust PCA-like algorithms derived from our framework have outstanding performance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Wenzhuo Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Wenzhuo", "Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan"], "pages": 10}
