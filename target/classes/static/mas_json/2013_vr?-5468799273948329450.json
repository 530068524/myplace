Visualization metaphors and audio messages are displayed as feedback to guide the learner, which is essential to this training. First results show that our system provides an adaptive guiding which is efficient for beginners. Though we focus on fluvial navigation training, the results may be relevant to other applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Technology of Compi\u00e8gne", "University of Technology of Compi\u00e8gne"], "authors": ["Lo\u00efc Fricoteaux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fricoteaux:Lo=iuml=c", "Indira Thouvenin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thouvenin:Indira"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
