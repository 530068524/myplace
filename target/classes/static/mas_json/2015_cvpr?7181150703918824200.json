{"title": "Matrix completion for resolving label ambiguity.", "fields": ["ambiguity", "pattern recognition", "classifier", "matrix completion", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In real applications, data is not always explicitly-labeled. For instance, label ambiguity exists when we associate two persons appearing in a news photo with two names provided in the caption. We propose a matrix completion-based method for predicting the actual labels from the ambiguously labeled instances, and a standard supervised classifier can learn from the disambiguated labels to classify new data. We further generalize the method to handle the labeling constraints between instances when such prior knowledge is available. Compared to existing methods, our approach achieves 2.9% improvement on the labeling accuracy of the Lost dataset and comparable performance on the Labeled Yahoo! News dataset.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ching-Hui Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ching=Hui", "Vishal M.
