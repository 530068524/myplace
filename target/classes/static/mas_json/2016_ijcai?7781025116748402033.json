{"title": "Distributing Knowledge into Simple Bases.", "fields": ["operator", "merge", "hamming distance", "knowledge base", "classical logic"], "abstract": "Understanding the behavior of belief change operators for fragments of classical logic has received increasing interest over the last years. Results in this direction are mainly concerned with adapting representation theorems. However, fragment-driven belief change also leads to novel research questions. In this paper we propose the concept of belief distribution, which can be understood as the reverse task of merging. More specifically, we are interested in the following question: given an arbitrary knowledge base K and some merging operator \u0394, can we find a profile E and a constraint \u00b5, both from a given fragment of classical logic, such that \u0394\u00b5(E) yields a result equivalent to K? In other words, we are interested in seeing if K can be distributed into knowledge bases of simpler structure, such that the task of merging allows for a reconstruction of the original knowledge. Our initial results show that merging based on drastic distance allows for an easy distribution of knowledge, while the power of distribution for operators based on Hamming distance relies heavily on the fragment of choice.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Adrian Haret.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haret:Adrian", "Jean-Guy Mailly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mailly:Jean=Guy", "Stefan Woltran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woltran:Stefan"], "pages": 7}
