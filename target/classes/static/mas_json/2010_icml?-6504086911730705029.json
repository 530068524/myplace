Different from traditional batch-mode group lasso algorithms, which suffer from the inefficiency and poor scalability, our proposed algorithm performs in an online mode and scales well: at each iteration one can update the weight vector according to a closed-form solution based on the average of previous subgradients. Therefore, the proposed online algorithm can be very efficient and scalable. This is guaranteed by its low worst-case time complexity and memory cost both in the order of O(d), where d is the number of dimensions. Moreover, in order to achieve more sparsity in both the group level and the individual feature level, we successively extend our online system to efficiently solve a number of variants of sparse group lasso models. We also show that the online system is applicable to other group lasso models, such as the group lasso with overlap and graph lasso. Finally, we demonstrate the merits of our algorithm by experimenting with both synthetic and real-world datasets.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Max Planck Society", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Haiqin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Haiqin", "Zenglin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zenglin", "Irwin King.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/King:Irwin", "Michael R.
