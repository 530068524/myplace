Cascadia allows application developers and even users to specify events of interest using either a declarative query language or a graphical interface with an intuitive visual language. Cascadia then effectively extracts these events from data in spite of the unreliability of RFID technology and the inherent ambiguity in event extraction.   We demonstrate Cascadia's technique through a digital diary application in the form of a calendar. Cascadia automatically populates the calendar with meaningful events for the user. We use data collected in a building-wide RFID deployment.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Nodira Khoussainova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khoussainova:Nodira", "Evan Welbourne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welbourne:Evan", "Magdalena Balazinska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balazinska:Magdalena", "Gaetano Borriello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borriello:Gaetano", "Garrett Cole.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cole:Garrett", "Julie Letchner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Letchner:Julie", "Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yang", "Christopher R\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=eacute=:Christopher", "Dan Suciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suciu:Dan", "Jordan Walke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walke:Jordan"], "pages": 4}
