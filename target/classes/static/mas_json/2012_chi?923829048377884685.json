We introduce  WalkType , an adaptive text entry system that leverages the mobile device's built-in tri-axis accelerometer to compensate for extraneous movement while walking. WalkType's classification model uses the displacement and acceleration of the device, and inference about the user's footsteps. Additionally, WalkType models finger-touch location and finger distance traveled on the screen, features that increase overall accuracy regardless of movement. The final model was built on typing data collected from 16 participants. In a study comparing WalkType to a control condition, WalkType reduced uncorrected errors by 45.2% and increased typing speed by 12.9% for walking participants.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Mayank Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Mayank", "Leah Findlater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Findlater:Leah", "Jacob O.
