{"title": "Automatic dimension inference and checking for object-oriented programs.", "fields": ["primitive data type", "programmer", "inference", "exploit", "string"], "abstract": "This paper introduces UniFi, a tool that attempts to automatically detect dimension errors in Java programs. UniFi infers dimensional relationships across primitive type and string variables in a program, using an inter-procedural, context-sensitive analysis. It then monitors these dimensional relationships as the program evolves, flagging inconsistencies that may be errors. UniFi requires no programmer annotations, and supports arbitrary program-specific dimensions, thus providing fine-grained dimensional consistency checking. UniFi exploits features of object-oriented languages, but can be used for other languages as well. We have run UniFi on real-life Java code and found that it is useful in exposing dimension errors. We present a case study of using UniFi on nightly builds of a 19,000 line code base as it evolved over 10 months.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Sudheendra Hangal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hangal:Sudheendra", "Monica S.
