With the emergence of big data ecosystems in which data is typically stored on multiple systems, UNION ALL has become even more important. In this paper, we present optimization techniques implemented in Teradata Database for join queries with UNION ALL. Instead of spooling all branches of UNION ALL before performing join operations, we propose cost-based pushing of joins into branches. Join pushing not only addresses the prohibitive cost of spooling all branches, but also helps in exposing more efficient join methods (e.g., direct hash-based joins) which, otherwise, would not be considered by the query optimizer. The geography of relations being pushed to UNION ALL branches is also adjusted to avoid unnecessary redistributions and duplications of data. We conclude the paper with a performance study that demonstrates the impact of the proposed optimization techniques on query performance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Teradata", "Teradata", "Teradata", "Teradata", "Teradata"], "authors": ["Mohammed Al-Kateb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Al=Kateb:Mohammed", "Paul Sinclair.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinclair:Paul", "Alain Crolotte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crolotte:Alain", "Lu Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Lu", "Grace Au.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Au:Grace", "Sanjay Nair.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nair:Sanjay"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
