Given a sequence of natural language instructions and an unaligned video recording, we simultaneously align each instruction to its corresponding video segment, and also align nouns in each instruction to their corresponding objects in video. While existing grounded language acquisition algorithms rely on pre-aligned supervised data (each sentence paired with corresponding image frame or video segment), our algorithm aims to automatically infer the alignment from the temporal structure of the video and parallel text instructions. We propose two generative models that are closely related to the HMM and IBM 1 word alignment models used in statistical machine translation. We evaluate our algorithm on videos of biological experiments performed in wetlabs, and demonstrate its capability of aligning video segments to text instructions and matching video objects to nouns in the absence of any direct supervision.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Iftekhar Naim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naim:Iftekhar", "Young Chol Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Young_Chol", "Qiguang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qiguang", "Henry A.
