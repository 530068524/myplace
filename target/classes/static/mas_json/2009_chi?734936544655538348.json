We conducted a study involving younger and older adults to compare their web search behavior and performance in ill-defined and well-defined information tasks using a health information website. In ill-defined tasks, only a general description about information needs was given, while in well-defined tasks, information needs as well as the specific target information were given. We found that older adults performed worse than younger adults in well-defined tasks, but the reverse was true in ill-defined tasks. Older adults compensated for their lower cognitive abilities by adopting a top-down knowledge-driven strategy to achieve the same level of performance in the ill-defined tasks. Indeed, path models showed that cognitive abilities, health literacy, and knowledge influenced search strategies adopted by older and younger adults. Design implications are also discussed.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jessie Chin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chin:Jessie", "Wai-Tat Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Wai=Tat", "Thomas George Kannampallil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kannampallil:Thomas_George"], "pages": 10}
