{"title": "Protecting sensitive web content from client-side vulnerabilities with CRYPTONS.", "fields": ["internet security", "web application security", "web accessibility initiative", "browser security", "web modeling"], "abstract": "Web browsers isolate web origins, but do not provide direct abstractions to isolate sensitive data and control computation over it within the same origin. As a result, guaranteeing security of sensitive web content requires trusting all code in the browser and client-side applications to be vulnerability-free. In this paper, we propose a new abstraction, called Crypton, which supports intra-origin control over sensitive data throughout its life cycle. To securely enforce the semantics of Cryptons, we develop a standalone component called Crypton-Kernel, which extensively leverages the functionality of existing web browsers without relying on their large TCB. Our evaluation demonstrates that the Crypton abstraction supported by the Crypton-Kernel is widely applicable to popular real-world applications with millions of users, including webmail, chat, blog applications, and Alexa Top 50 websites, with low performance overhead.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Peking University", "New York University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Xinshu Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Xinshu", "Zhaofeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhaofeng", "Hossein Siadati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siadati:Hossein", "Shruti Tople.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tople:Shruti", "Prateek Saxena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saxena:Prateek", "Zhenkai Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Zhenkai"], "pages": 14}
