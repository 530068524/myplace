The language is expressive enough to generate continuous distributions, which raises the question of how to compute effectively in the language. This paper gives an new characterization of ProbNetKAT\u2019s semantics using domain theory, which provides the foundation needed to build a practical implementation. We show how to use the semantics to approximate the behavior of arbitrary ProbNetKAT programs using distributions with finite support. We develop a prototype implementation and show how to use it to solve a variety of problems including characterizing the expected congestion induced by different routing schemes and reasoning probabilistically about reachability in a network.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "University College London"], "authors": ["Steffen Smolka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smolka:Steffen", "Praveen Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Praveen", "Nate Foster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foster:Nate", "Dexter Kozen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozen:Dexter", "Alexandra Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silva_0001:Alexandra"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2017", "pages": 15}
