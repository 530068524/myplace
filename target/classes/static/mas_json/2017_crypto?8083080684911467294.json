Moreover, it should be difficult to remove the watermark without destroying the functionality of the program. Recently, Cohen et al. (STOC 2016) and Boneh et al. (PKC 2017) showed how to watermark cryptographic functions such as PRFs using indistinguishability obfuscation. Notably, in their constructions, the watermark remains intact even against arbitrary removal strategies. A natural question is whether we can build watermarking schemes from standard assumptions that achieve this strong mark-unremovability property.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Sam Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sam", "David J.
