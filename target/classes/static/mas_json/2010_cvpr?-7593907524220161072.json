Exploiting prior knowledge may be useful to reproduce the human capability of recognizing objects even from only one single view. This paper presents an SVM-based model adaptation algorithm able to select and weight appropriately prior knowledge coming from different categories. The method relies on the solution of a convex optimization problem which ensures to have the minimal leave-one-out error on the training set. Experiments on a subset of the Caltech-256 database show that the proposed method produces better results than both choosing one single prior model, and transferring from all previous experience in a flat uninformative way.", "citation": "Citations (143)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Idiap Research Institute", "University of Milan", "Idiap Research Institute"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tatiana Tommasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tommasi:Tatiana", "Francesco Orabona.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orabona:Francesco", "Barbara Caputo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caputo:Barbara"], "pages": 8}
