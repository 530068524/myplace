This problem has been shown to be undecidable if strategies with perfect recall, i.e., history-dependent, are considered. In this paper, we show that, if restricted to co-safe properties, a subset of PCTL properties capable to specify a wide range of properties in practice including reachability ones, the problem turns to be decidable, even when the class of general strategies is considered. We also give an algorithm for solving robust stochastic planning, where a winning strategy is tolerant to some perturbations of probabilities in the model. Our result indicates that satisfiability of co-safe PCTL is decidable as well.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Lei Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Lei", "Yuan Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Yuan", "Lijun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lijun"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
