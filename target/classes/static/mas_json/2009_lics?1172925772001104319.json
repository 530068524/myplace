Focused sequent calculi for classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and multiplicative-additive linear logic are derived as fragments of LKU by increasing the sensitivity of specialized structural rules to polarity information. We develop a unified, streamlined framework for proving cut-elimination in the various fragments. Furthermore, each sublogic can interact with other fragments through cut. We also consider the possibility of introducing classical-linear hybrid logics.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Hofstra University", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Chuck Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Chuck", "Dale Miller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miller_0001:Dale"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
