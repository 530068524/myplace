Through three and a half years of iterative fieldwork and system design, we have developed a deep understanding of their synthetic research practices, specifically regarding meta-studies. Here we detail the challenges researchers face conducting meta-studies and how this collective effort advances the entire scholarly community. We illustrate how our understanding of this synthetic research practice informs the design and refinement of cyberinfrastructure to better support their work.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County"], "authors": ["Alyson Leigh Young.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Young:Alyson_Leigh", "Wayne G.
