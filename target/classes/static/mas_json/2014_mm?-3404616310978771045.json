We propose gesture attributes, derived from speakers' tracked hand motions to automatically quantify these gestures from video. Then, we demonstrate a correlation between gesture attributes and an objective method of measuring audience engagement: electroencephalography (EEG) in the domain of political debates. We collect 47 minutes of EEG recordings from each of 20 subjects watching clips of the 2012 U.S. Presidential debates. The subjects are examined in aggregate and in subgroups according to gender and political affiliation. We find statistically significant correlations between gesture attributes (particularly extremal pose) and our feature of engagement derived from EEG both with and without audio. For some stratifications, the Spearman rank correlation reaches as high as rho = 0.283 with p", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Stanford University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["John R.
