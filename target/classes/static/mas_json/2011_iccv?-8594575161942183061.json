To do this, we build upon the heterogeneous nature of the scene by imposing consistency over object materials so as to allow for small compositional variations across objects in the image. Once the consistency has been imposed, we aim at maximising the quality of the images under consideration based upon user input. This provides the flexibility necessary to utilise user profiles for the automatic processing of real world imagery while avoiding undesirable effects encountered when colour images are produced. We provide results on real-world imagery and illustrate how the method can be used to produce material-specific colours based upon user input.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Australian National University", "NICTA", "NICTA", "Australian National University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Lin Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Lin", "Cong Phuoc Huynh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huynh:Cong_Phuoc", "Antonio Robles-Kelly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robles=Kelly:Antonio", "Jun Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Jun"], "pages": 8}
