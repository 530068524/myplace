{"title": "Fine-grained location extraction from tweets with temporal awareness.", "fields": ["data mining", "computer science", "information retrieval", "conditional random field", "schema"], "abstract": "Twitter is a popular platform for sharing activities, plans, and opinions. Through tweets, users often reveal their location information and short term visiting plans. In this paper, we are interested in extracting fine-grained locations mentioned in tweets with temporal awareness. More specifically, we like to extract each point-of-interest (POI) mention in a tweet and predict whether the user has visited, is currently at, or will soon visit this POI. Our proposed solution, named PETAR, consists of two main components: a POI inventory and a time-aware POI tagger. The POI inventory is built by exploiting the crowd wisdom of Foursquare community. It contains not only the formal names of POIs but also the informal abbreviations. The POI tagger, based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, is designed to simultaneously identify the POIs and resolve their associated temporal awareness. In our experiments, we investigated four types of features (i.e., lexical, grammatical, geographical, and BILOU schema features) for time-aware POI extraction. With the four types of features, PETAR achieves promising extraction accuracy and outperforms all baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["Wuhan University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Chenliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chenliang", "Aixin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Aixin"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
