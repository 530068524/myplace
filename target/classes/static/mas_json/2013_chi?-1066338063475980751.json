We addressed this issue with a novel approach: studying how people engaged with the same interactive installation in ten situations with varying spatial and social properties. The main finding across these studies is that place trumps space: a conducive social context could overcome a poor physical space and encourage interaction; conversely, an inappropriate social context could inhibit interaction in spaces that might normally facilitate engagement. We discuss this finding in terms of the salience of the display within the space, the visibility of incidental interactions with the installation, the different understandings of place that people can have in the same location and the role of emergent champions and comperes in encouraging interaction.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Imeh Akpan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Akpan:Imeh", "Paul Marshall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marshall:Paul", "Jon Bird.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bird:Jon", "Daniel Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Daniel"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
