The algorithms are compact (using only x-coordinates), run in constant time with uniform execution patterns, and do not distinguish between the curve and its quadratic twist; they thus have a built-in measure of side-channel resistance. (For comparison, we also implement two faster but non-constant-time algorithms.) The core of our construction is a suite of two-dimensional differential addition chains driven by efficient endomorphism decompositions, built on curves selected from a family of \u211a-curve reductions over \\(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}\\) with p = 2127 \u2212 1. We include state-of-the-art experimental results for twist-secure, constant-time, x-coordinate-only scalar multiplication.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Ya\u015far University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Craig Costello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Costello:Craig", "H\u00fcseyin Hisil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hisil:H=uuml=seyin", "Benjamin Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith_0003:Benjamin"], "pages": 18}
