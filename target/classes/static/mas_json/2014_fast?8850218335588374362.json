{"title": "Log-structured memory for DRAM-based storage.", "fields": ["conventional memory", "uniform memory access", "registered memory", "computer memory", "interleaved memory"], "abstract": "Traditional memory allocation mechanisms are not suitable for new DRAM-based storage systems because they use memory inefficiently, particularly under changing access patterns. In contrast, a log-structured approach to memory management allows 80-90% memory utilization while offering high performance. The RAMCloud storage system implements a unified log-structured mechanism both for active information in memory and backup data on disk. The RAMCloud implementation of log-structured memory uses a two-level cleaning policy, which conserves disk bandwidth and improves performance up to 6\u00d7 at high memory utilization. The cleaner runs concurrently with normal operations and employs multiple threads to hide most of the cost of cleaning.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Stephen M.
