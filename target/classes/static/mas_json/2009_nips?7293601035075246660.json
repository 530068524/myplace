Anomalies are declared whenever the score of a test sample falls below \u03b1, which is supposed to be the desired false alarm level. The resulting anomaly detector is shown to be asymptotically optimal in that it is uniformly most powerful for the specified false alarm level, \u03b1, for the case when the anomaly density is a mixture of the nominal and a known density. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, being linear in dimension and quadratic in data size. It does not require choosing complicated tuning parameters or function approximation classes and it can adapt to local structure such as local change in dimensionality. We demonstrate the algorithm on both artificial and real data sets in high dimensional feature spaces.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Boston University", "Boston University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Manqi Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Manqi", "Venkatesh Saligrama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saligrama:Venkatesh"], "pages": 9}
