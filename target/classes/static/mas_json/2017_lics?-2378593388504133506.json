The basic algebra can be enriched with additional features. We consider the diversity relation, the full relation, intersection, set difference, projection, coprojection, converse, and transitive closure. It is customary to express boolean queries on binary relational structures as finite conjunctions of containments. We investigate which features are primitive in this setting, in the sense that omitting the feature would allow strictly less boolean queries to be expressible. Our main result is that, modulo a finite list of elementary interdependencies among the features, every feature is indeed primitive.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Hasselt", "University of Hasselt", "Indiana University"], "authors": ["Dimitri Surinx.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Surinx:Dimitri", "Jan Van den Bussche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bussche:Jan_Van_den", "Dirk Van Gucht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gucht:Dirk_Van"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
