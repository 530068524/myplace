The strength of our approach lies in two new algorithms. First, a loop overhead removal algorithm provides precise control of trade-offs between loop overhead and code size based on actual loop nesting depth. Second, an if-statement simplification algorithm further reduces the number of comparisons in the code. These algorithms combined with the expressive power of Presburger arithmetic enable CodeGen+ to support complex optimization strategies expressed in iteration spaces. We compare with the state-of-the-art polyhedra scanning tool CLooG on five loop nest computations, demonstrating that CodeGen+ generates code that is simpler and up to 1.15x faster.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Utah"], "authors": ["Chun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chun"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
