We first relate the definition of the capacity region to the weighted fractional coloring problem. Then, the scheduling-for-stability problem under deterministic arrivals is studied in light of this relationship. We emphasize the requirement that the scheduling algorithm uses a tractable amount of processing and storage resources. Two classes of algorithms are defined and a complexity result is derived for the intersection of the two classes. We also exhibit an algorithm that can achieve the storage requirement by relaxing the processing requirement. The results are used to examine interesting sections of the capacity region. Finally, we relate the new interpretation and theory about the capacity region to the notion of set \u03c3-local pooling.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Liqun Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Liqun", "Soung Chang Liew.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liew:Soung_Chang", "Jianwei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jianwei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
