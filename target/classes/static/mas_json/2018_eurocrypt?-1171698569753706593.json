The MP12 work only offered a highly optimized algorithm for the on-line stage of the computation in the special case when the lattice modulus q is a power of two. For arbitrary modulus q, the MP12 preimage sampling procedure resorted to general lattice algorithms with complexity cubic in the bitsize of the modulus (or quadratic, but with substantial preprocessing and storage overheads). Our new preimage sampling algorithm (for any modulus q) achieves linear complexity with very modest storage requirements, and experimentally outperforms the generic method of MP12 already for small values of q. As an additional contribution, we give a new, quasi-linear time algorithm for the off-line perturbation sampling phase of MP12 in the ring setting. Our algorithm is based on a variant of the Fast Fourier Orthogonalization (FFO) algorithm of (Ducas and Prest, ISSAC 2016), but avoids the need to precompute and store the FFO matrix by a careful rearrangement of the operations. All our algorithms are fairly simple, with small hidden constants, and offer a practical alternative to use the MP12 trapdoor lattices in a broad range of cryptographic applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Nicholas Genise.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Genise:Nicholas", "Daniele Micciancio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micciancio:Daniele"], "pages": 30}
