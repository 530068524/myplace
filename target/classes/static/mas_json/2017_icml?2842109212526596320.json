While Bayesian optimization has emerged as a popular approach for optimizing black-box functions, its applicability has been limited to low-dimensional problems due to its computational and statistical challenges arising from high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose to tackle these challenges by (1) assuming a latent additive structure in the function and inferring it properly for more efficient and effective BO, and (2) performing multiple evaluations in parallel to reduce the number of iterations required by the method. Our novel approach learns the latent structure with Gibbs sampling and constructs batched queries using determinantal point processes. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world functions demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Zi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zi", "Chengtao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chengtao", "Stefanie Jegelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jegelka:Stefanie", "Pushmeet Kohli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kohli:Pushmeet"], "pages": 9}
