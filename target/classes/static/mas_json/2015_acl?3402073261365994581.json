{"title": "Simple Learning and Compositional Application of Perceptually Grounded Word Meanings for Incremental Reference Resolution.", "fields": ["phrase", "distributional semantics", "machine learning", "formal semantics", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "An elementary way of using language is to refer to objects. Often, these objects are physically present in the shared environment and reference is done via mention of perceivable properties of the objects. This is a type of language use that is modelled well neither by logical semantics nor by distributional semantics, the former focusing on inferential relations between expressed propositions, the latter on similarity relations between words or phrases. We present an account of word and phrase meaning that is perceptually grounded, trainable, compositional, and \u2018dialogueplausible\u2019 in that it computes meanings word-by-word. We show that the approach performs well (with an accuracy of 65% on a 1-out-of-32 reference resolution task) on direct descriptions and target/landmark descriptions, even when trained with less than 800 training examples and automatically transcribed utterances.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of York", "Bielefeld University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Casey Kennington.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kennington:Casey", "David Schlangen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schlangen:David"], "pages": 10}
