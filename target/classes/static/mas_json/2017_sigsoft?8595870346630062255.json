This raises the challenge to find optimal performing configurations for an anticipated workload. As SPL configuration spaces are huge, it is infeasible to benchmark all configurations to find an optimal one. Prior work focused on building performance models to predict and optimize SPL configurations. Instead, we randomly sample and recursively search a configuration space directly to find near-optimal configurations without constructing a prediction model. Our algorithms are simpler and have higher accuracy and efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Bauhaus University, Weimar"], "authors": ["Jeho Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Jeho", "Don S.
