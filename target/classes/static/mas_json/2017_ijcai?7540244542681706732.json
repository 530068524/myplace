In the semantic Web, data is interpreted in ontologies and its ordered sequence is represented as an ontology stream. Our work exploits the semantics of such streams to tackle the problem of concept drift i.e., unexpected changes in data distribution, causing most of models to be less accurate as time passes. To this end we revisited (i) semantic inference in the context of supervised stream learning, and (ii) models with semantic embeddings. The experiments show accurate prediction with data from Dublin and Beijing.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Accenture", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Zhejiang University", "Computing Science"], "authors": ["Jiaoyan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jiaoyan", "Freddy L\u00e9cu\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=eacute=cu=eacute=:Freddy", "Jeff Z.
