Our goal is to inform the design of future sustainable technologies through an exploration of existing \"green\" lifestyles. We describe the motivations, practices, and experiences of the participants. The participants had diverse motivations ranging from caring for the Earth to frugal minimalism, and most participants also evidenced a desire to be unique. Most participants actively and consciously managed their homes and their daily practices to optimize their environmental responsibility. Their efforts to be environmentally responsible typically required significant dedication of time, attention, and other resources. As this level of commitment and desire to be unique may not generalize readily to the broader population, we discuss the importance of interactive technologies that influence surrounding infrastructure and circumstances in order to facilitate environmental responsibility.", "citation": "Citations (199)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Intel", "PlaceCoach, Inc ... boygan, WI, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Allison Woodruff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woodruff:Allison", "Jay Hasbrouck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasbrouck:Jay", "Sally Augustin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Augustin:Sally"], "pages": 10}
