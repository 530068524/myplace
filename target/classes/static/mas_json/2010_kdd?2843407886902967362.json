We consider the problem of selecting a set of  k  active nodes that best explain the observed activation state, under a given information-propagation model. We call these nodes  effectors . We formally define the  k -Effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs. We show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only NP-hard to solve optimally, but also NP-hard to approximate. We also show that, for some special cases, the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the  k -Effectors problem in networks. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms using the  DBLP  co-authorship graph, where we search for effectors of topics that appear in research papers.", "citation": "Citations (192)", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "Boston University", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens", "University of Helsinki"], "authors": ["Theodoros Lappas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lappas:Theodoros", "Evimaria Terzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terzi:Evimaria", "Dimitrios Gunopulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gunopulos:Dimitrios", "Heikki Mannila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannila:Heikki"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
