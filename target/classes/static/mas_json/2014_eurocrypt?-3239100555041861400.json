Indeed, many indifferentiable hash functions have been constructed and could since be used in place of random oracles. Unfortunately, Ristenpart, Shacham, and Shrimpton (RSS; Eurocrypt 2011) discovered that for a large class of security notions, the MRH composition theorem actually does not apply. To bridge the gap they suggested a stronger notion called reset indifferentiability and established a generalized version of the MRH composition theorem. However, as recent works by Demay et al. (Eurocrypt 2013) and Baecher et al. (Asiacrypt 2013) brought to light, reset indifferentiability is not achievable thereby re-opening the quest for a notion that is sufficient for multi-stage games and achievable at the same time.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Arno Mittelbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mittelbach:Arno"], "pages": 19}
