These structures trade a small amount of error for significant space savings, enabling the use of larger language models on relatively modest hardware.\n\nGoing beyond space efficient count storage, here we present the Talbot Osborne Morris Bloom (TOMB) Counter, an extended model for performing space efficient counting over streams of finite length. Theoretical and experimental results are given, showing the promise of approximate counting over large vocabularies in the context of limited space.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Benjamin Van Durme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durme:Benjamin_Van", "Ashwin Lall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lall:Ashwin"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
