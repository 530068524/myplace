Unlike previous work which addressed classification and orientation separately with different models, our method involves a probabilistic framework to approach both in a unified fashion. We address both problems in terms of a set of view-related models which couple discriminative expert classifiers with sample-dependent priors, facilitating easy integration of other cues (e.g. motion, shape) in a Bayesian fashion. This mixture-of-experts formulation approximates the probability density of pedestrian orientation and scales-up to the use of multiple cameras. Experiments on large real-world data show a significant performance improvement in both pedestrian classification and orientation estimation of up to 50%, compared to state-of-the-art, using identical data and evaluation techniques.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Daimler AG"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Markus Enzweiler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Enzweiler:Markus", "Dariu M.
