{"title": "The problem of conflicting social spheres: effects of network structure on experienced tension in social network sites.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "spheres", "survey research", "social network", "computer science"], "abstract": "We propose that a fundamental property of human psychology, the need to maintain independent social spheres, imposes constraints on the use of social network sites (SNS). We particularly focus on the consequences of visibility of communications across social spheres, and we hypothesize that technological features of SNS may bring social spheres in conflict, thus leading to increased levels of online social tension. A survey study among Facebook users was conducted to test this hypothesis. Results showed that diversity of the Facebook network predicted online tension. Moreover, the number of kin in a Facebook network was a crucial component because it predicted online tension whereas number of work and social contacts did not. Further, evidence was found to support the idea that tension might impose an upper limit on network size. We conclude with a discussion of these findings and describe how they support the thrust of recent modifications to SNS designs.", "citation": "Citations (217)", "departments": ["University of Manchester", "University of Manchester", "University of Manchester"], "authors": ["Jens F.
