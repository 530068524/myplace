{"title": "Temporal Support for Persistent Stored Modules.", "fields": ["data definition language", "stored procedure", "null", "transaction time", "sql psm"], "abstract": "We show how to extend temporal support of SQL to the Turing-complete portion of SQL, that of persistent stored modules (PSM). Our approach requires minor new syntax beyond that already in SQL/Temporal to define and to invoke PSM routines, thereby extending the current, sequenced, and non-sequenced semantics of queries to PSM routines. Temporal upward compatibility (existing applications work as before when one or more tables are rendered temporal) is ensured. We provide a transformation that converts Temporal SQL/PSM to conventional SQL/PSM. To support sequenced evaluation of PSM routines, we define two different slicing approaches, maximal slicing and per-statement slicing. We compare these approaches empirically using a comprehensive benchmark and provide a heuristic for choosing between them.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Arizona", "IBM", "University of Arizona", "Queen's University"], "authors": ["Richard T.
