Since its posterior distribution is intractable, current inference methods have all relied on MCMC sampling. In this paper, we develop an alternative inference technique based on variational methods. To employ variational methods, we derive a tree-based stick-breaking construction of the nCRP mixture model, and a novel variational algorithm that efficiently explores a posterior over a large set of combinatorial structures. We demonstrate the use of this approach for text and hand written digits modeling, where we show we can adapt the nCRP to continuous data as well.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Chong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Chong", "David M.
