{"title": "Playable data: characterizing the design space of game-y infographics.", "fields": ["game mechanics", "infographic", "visual analytics", "visualization", "narrative"], "abstract": "This work explores the intersection between infographics and games by examining how to embed meaningful visual analytic interactions into game mechanics that in turn impact user behavior around a data-driven graphic. In contrast to other methods of narrative visualization, games provide an alternate method for structuring a story, not bound by a linear arrangement but still providing structure via rules, goals, and mechanics of play. We designed two different versions of a game-y infographic, Salubrious Nation, and compared them to a non-game-y version in an online experiment. We assessed the relative merits of the game-y approach of presentation in terms of exploration of the visualization, insights and learning, and enjoyment of the experience. Based on our results, we discuss some of the benefits and drawbacks of our designs. More generally, we identify challenges and opportunities for further exploration of this new design space.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Nicholas Diakopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakopoulos:Nicholas", "Funda Kivran-Swaine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kivran=Swaine:Funda", "Mor Naaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naaman:Mor"], "pages": 10}
