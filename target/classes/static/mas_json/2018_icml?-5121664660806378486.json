In particular, the first problem is a fundamental problem that has undergone a tremendous amount of research. We study the parameterized complexity of the two aforementioned problems with respect to several parameters of interest, including the minimum number of matrix rows, columns, and rows plus columns needed to cover all missing entries. We obtain new algorithmic results showing that, for the bounded domain case, both problems are fixed-parameter tractable with respect to all aforementioned parameters. We complement these results with a lower-bound result for the unbounded domain case that rules out fixed-parameter tractability w.r.t. some of the parameters under consideration.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "DePaul University", "University of Sheffield", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Robert Ganian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganian:Robert", "Iyad A.
