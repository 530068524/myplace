{"title": "LSTD: A Low-Shot Transfer Detector for Object Detection.", "fields": ["deep learning", "training set", "object detection", "architecture", "transfer of learning"], "abstract": "Recent advances in object detection are mainly driven by deep learning with large-scale detection benchmarks. However, the fully-annotated training set is often limited for a target detection task, which may deteriorate the performance of deep detectors. To address this challenge, we propose a novel low-shot transfer detector (LSTD) in this paper, where we leverage rich source-domain knowledge to construct an effective target-domain detector with very few training examples. The main contributions are described as follows. First, we design a flexible deep architecture of LSTD to alleviate transfer difficulties in low-shot detection. This architecture can integrate the advantages of both SSD and Faster RCNN in a unified deep framework. Second, we introduce a novel regularized transfer learning framework for low-shot detection, where the transfer knowledge (TK) and background depression (BD) regularizations are proposed to leverage object knowledge respectively from source and target domains, in order to further enhance fine-tuning with a few target images. Finally, we examine our LSTD on a number of challenging low-shot detection experiments, where LSTD outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. The results demonstrate that LSTD is a preferable deep detector for low-shot scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Hao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hao", "Yali Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yali", "Guoyou Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Guoyou", "Yu Qiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiao_0001:Yu"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
