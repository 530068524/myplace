In a geometrical setting, each step of HMC corresponds to a geodesic on a Riemannian manifold with a Jacobi metric. Our calculation of the sectional curvature of this HMC manifold allows us to see that it is positive in cases such as sampling from a high dimensional multivariate Gaussian. We show that positive curvature can be used to prove theoretical concentration results for HMC Markov chains.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Christof Seiler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seiler:Christof", "Simon Rubinstein-Salzedo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubinstein=Salzedo:Simon", "Susan P.
