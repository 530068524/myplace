If the class ratio of the test dataset is known, instance re-weighting or resampling allows systematical bias correction. However, learning the class ratio of the test dataset is challenging when no labeled data is available from the test domain. In this paper, we propose to estimate the class ratio in the test dataset by matching probability distributions of training and test input data. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach through experiments.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Marthinus Christoffel du Plessis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plessis:Marthinus_Christoffel_du", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
