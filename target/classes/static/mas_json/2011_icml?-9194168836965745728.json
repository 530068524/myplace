Classifying human motions is a critical task in motion editing and synthesizing, for which manual labeling is clearly inefficient for large databases. Here we study the general problem of time series clustering. We propose a novel method of clustering time series that can (a) learn joint temporal dynamics in the data; (b) handle time lags; and (c) produce interpretable features. We achieve this by developing complex-valued linear dynamical systems (CLDS), which include real-valued Kalman filters as a special case; our advantage is that the transition matrix is simpler (just diagonal), and the transmission one easier to interpret. We then present Complex-Fit, a novel EM algorithm to learn the parameters for the general model and its special case for clustering. Our approach produces significant improvement in clustering quality, 1.5 to 5 times better than well-known competitors on real motion capture sequences.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Lei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0005:Lei", "B.
