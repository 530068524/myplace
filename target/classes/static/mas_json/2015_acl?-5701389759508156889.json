In addition to using the output and confidence of each system as input to the stacked classifier, we also use features capturing how well the systems agree about the provenance of the information they extract. We demonstrate that our stacking approach outperforms the best system from the 2014 KBPESF competition as well as alternative ensembling methods employed in the 2014 KBP Slot Filler Validation task and several other ensembling baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate that including provenance information further increases the performance of stacking.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Vidhoon Viswanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viswanathan:Vidhoon", "Nazneen Fatema Rajani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajani:Nazneen_Fatema", "Yinon Bentor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bentor:Yinon", "Raymond J.
