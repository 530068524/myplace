Motivated by the severe computational limitations of sensor networks, we present a randomized algorithm for network desynchronization that uses an extremely lightweight model of computation, while being robust to link volatility and node failure. These techniques also provide novel, ultra-lightweight randomized algorithms for quickly computing distributed vertex colorings using an asymp- totically optimal number of colors. I. INTRODUCTION As inherently distributed computational systems, sensor networks rely critically on coordination between nodes to effectively sense, communicate and interpret environmental data. Individual nodes face severe battery and computational limitations, so a notion of coordinated task-sharing and duty- cycling is critical to maintaining the longevity and efficient operation of the network. In this sense, desynchronizing the actions of nodes is desirable. Efficient desynchronization pro- tocols can be applied to a variety of sensor network applica- tions, including periodic resource sharing, coordinated sleep schedules, and evenly shared sensing burden across nearby nodes (3).", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Arik Motskin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Motskin:Arik", "Tim Roughgarden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roughgarden:Tim", "Primoz Skraba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skraba:Primoz", "Leonidas J.
