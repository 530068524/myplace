{"title": "A Blocking Bound for Nested FIFO Spin Locks.", "fields": ["lock", "abstraction", "transitive relation", "multiprocessing", "fifo"], "abstract": "Bounding worst-case blocking delays due to lock contention is a fundamental problem in the analysis of multiprocessor real-time systems. However, virtually all fine-grained (i.e., non-asymptotic) analyses published to date make a simplifying (but impractical) assumption: critical sections must not be nested. This paper overcomes this fundamental limitation and presents the first fine-grained blocking bound for nested non-preemptive FIFO spin locks under partitioned fixed-priority scheduling. To this end, a new analysis method is introduced, based on a graph abstraction that reflects all possible resource conflicts and transitive delays.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Alessandro Biondi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biondi:Alessandro", "Bj\u00f6rn B.
