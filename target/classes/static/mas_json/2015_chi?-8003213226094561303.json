Imitation learning uses data on human demonstrations to build behavioral models for robots. In order to cover a wide range of action strategies, data from many individuals is needed. Acquiring such large amounts of data can be a challenge. Tools for data capturing in this domain must thus implement a good user experience. We propose to use human computation games in order to gather data on human manual behavior. We demonstrate the idea with a strategy game that is operated via a natural user interface. A comparison between using the game for action execution and demonstrating actions in a virtual environment shows that people interact longer and have a better experience when playing the game.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "University of Bremen"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Benjamin Walther-Franks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walther=Franks:Benjamin", "Jan D.
