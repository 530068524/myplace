Symbolic execution is a program analysis technique introduced in the 70s that has received renewed interest in recent years, due to algorithmic advances and increased availability of computational power and constraint solving technology. We review classical symbolic execution and some modern extensions such as generalized symbolic execution and dynamic test generation. We also give a preliminary assessment of the use in academia, research labs, and industry.", "citation": "Citations (308)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Microsoft", "University of Texas at Austin", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Alberto Bacchelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bacchelli:Alberto"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
