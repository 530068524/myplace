To check the satisfiability of a formula, our procedure iteratively unfolds the formula and examines the derived disjuncts. In each iteration, it searches for a proof of either satisfiability or unsatisfiability. Our procedure is further enhanced with automatically inferred invariants as well as detection of cyclic proof. We also identify a syntactically restricted fragment of the logic for which our procedure is terminating and thus complete. This decidable fragment is relatively expressive as it can capture a range of sophisticated data structures with non-trivial pure properties, such as size, sortedness and near-balanced. We have implemented the proposed solver and a new system for verifying heap-based programs. We have evaluated our system on benchmark programs from a software verification competition.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Quang Loc Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Quang_Loc", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Wei-Ngan Chin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chin:Wei=Ngan"], "pages": 23}
