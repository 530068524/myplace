{"title": "Structured Learning for Taxonomy Induction with Belief Propagation.", "fields": ["stochastic optimization", "subgradient method", "structured prediction", "wordnet", "belief propagation"], "abstract": "We present a structured learning approach to inducing hypernym taxonomies using a probabilistic graphical model formulation. Our model incorporates heterogeneous relational evidence about both hypernymy and siblinghood, captured by semantic features based on patterns and statistics from Web n-grams and Wikipedia abstracts. For efficient inference over taxonomy structures, we use loopy belief propagation along with a directed spanning tree algorithm for the core hypernymy factor. To train the system, we extract sub-structures of WordNet and discriminatively learn to reproduce them, using adaptive subgradient stochastic optimization. On the task of reproducing sub-hierarchies of WordNet, our approach achieves a 51% error reduction over a chance baseline, including a 15% error reduction due to the non-hypernym-factored sibling features. On a comparison setup, we find up to 29% relative error reduction over previous work on ancestor F1.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "University of California, Berkeley", "Tsinghua University", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mohit Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Mohit", "David Burkett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burkett:David", "Gerard de Melo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melo:Gerard_de", "Dan Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Dan"], "pages": 11}
