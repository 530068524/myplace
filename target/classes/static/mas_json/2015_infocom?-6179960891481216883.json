More often than not, inappropriate stochastic traffic arrival models and/or service models lead to loose stochastic bounds. In practice, loose bounds occur due to inaccurate a-prior assumption on traffic arrivals and/or the obliviousness to possible correlation between arrivals. To alleviate this problem, this paper uses copula analysis to capture the correlation in traffic flows and introduces a statistical method to infer traffic arrival models. Using copula theory, we show the range of performance bounds that SNC can achieve. With concrete numerical examples and real-world experiments, it is demonstrated that copula analysis offers a new opportunity for extending SNC research and augmenting its impact in practice.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Victoria", "University of Victoria", "University of Victoria"], "authors": ["Fang Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Fang", "Kui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Kui", "S.
