{"title": "Capacity approaching coding for low noise interactive quantum communication.", "fields": ["quantum information science", "quantum", "conjecture", "coding theory", "randomness"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of implementing two-party interactive quantum communication over noisy channels, a necessary endeavor if we wish to fully reap quantum advantages for communication. For an arbitrary protocol with  n  messages, designed for  noiseless  qudit channels (where  d  is arbitrary), our main result is a simulation method that fails with probability less than 2 \u2212\u0398 ( n \u0454)  and uses a qudit channel  n  (1 + \u0398 (\u221a\u0454)) times, of which an \u0454 fraction can be corrupted adversarially. The simulation is thus capacity achieving to leading order, and we conjecture that it is optimal up to a constant factor in the \u221a\u0454 term. Furthermore, the simulation is in a model that does not require pre-shared resources such as randomness or entanglement between the communicating parties. Perhaps surprisingly, this outperforms the best known overhead of 1 +  O (\u221a\u0454 loglog1/\u0454) in the corresponding  classical  model, which is also conjectured to be optimal [Haeupler, FOCS\u201914]. Our work also improves over the best previously known quantum result where the overhead is a non-explicit large constant [Brassard  et al. , FOCS\u201914] for low \u0454.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Debbie Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Debbie", "Ashwin Nayak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nayak:Ashwin", "Ala Shayeghi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shayeghi:Ala", "Dave Touchette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Touchette:Dave", "Penghui Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Penghui", "Nengkun Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Nengkun"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2018", "pages": 14}
