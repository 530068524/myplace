{"title": "On the relative trust between inconsistent data and inaccurate constraints.", "fields": ["trusted computing", "functional dependency", "suspect", "semantics", "data mining"], "abstract": "Functional dependencies (FDs) specify the intended data semantics while violations of FDs indicate deviation from these semantics. In this paper, we study a data cleaning problem in which the FDs may not be completely correct, e.g., due to data evolution or incomplete knowledge of the data semantics. We argue that the notion of relative trust is a crucial aspect of this problem: if the FDs are outdated, we should modify them to fit the data, but if we suspect that there are problems with the data, we should modify the data to fit the FDs. In practice, it is usually unclear how much to trust the data versus the FDs. To address this problem, we propose an algorithm for generating non-redundant solutions (i.e., simultaneous modifications of the data and the FDs) corresponding to various levels of relative trust. This can help users determine the best way to modify their data and/or FDs to achieve consistency.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Qatar Airways", "Qatar Airways", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["George Beskales.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beskales:George", "Ihab F.
