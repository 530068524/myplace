We introduce a new variant of the Blum, Kalai and Wasserman algorithm, relying on a quantization step that generalizes and fine-tunes modulus switching. In general this new technique yields a significant gain in the constant in front of the exponent in the overall complexity. We illustrate this by solving within half a day a \\(\\mathsf {LWE}\\) instance with dimension \\(n=128\\), modulus \\(q=n^{2}\\), Gaussian noise \\(\\alpha =1/(\\sqrt{n/\\pi } \\log ^2 n)\\) and binary secret, using \\(2^{28}\\) samples, while the previous best result based on BKW claims a time complexity of \\(2^{74}\\) with \\(2^{60}\\) samples for the same parameters.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Institut Universitaire de France"], "authors": ["Paul Kirchner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirchner:Paul", "Pierre-Alain Fouque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fouque:Pierre=Alain"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
