This success can be largely attributed to learning shared representations from multiple supervisory tasks. However, existing multi-task approaches rely on enumerating multiple network architectures specific to the tasks at hand, that do not generalize. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to learn shared representations in ConvNets using multitask learning. Specifically, we propose a new sharing unit: \"cross-stitch\" unit. These units combine the activations from multiple networks and can be trained end-to-end. A network with cross-stitch units can learn an optimal combination of shared and task-specific representations. Our proposed method generalizes across multiple tasks and shows dramatically improved performance over baseline methods for categories with few training examples.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ishan Misra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Misra:Ishan", "Abhinav Shrivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrivastava:Abhinav", "Abhinav Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Abhinav", "Martial Hebert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hebert:Martial"], "pages": 10}
