This problem arises in a diversity of applications including diagnosis of dynamical systems and activity recognition. We provide a logical characterization of the notion of an explanation. To generate explanations we identify and exploit a correspondence between explanation generation and planning. The determination of good explanations requires additional domain-specific knowledge which we represent as preferences over explanations. The nature of explanations requires us to formulate preferences in a somewhat retrodictive fashion by utilizing Past Linear Temporal Logic. We propose methods for exploiting these somewhat unique preferences effectively within state-of-the-art planners and illustrate the feasibility of generating (preferred) explanations via planning.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Pontifical Catholic University of Chile", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Shirin Sohrabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sohrabi:Shirin", "Jorge A.
