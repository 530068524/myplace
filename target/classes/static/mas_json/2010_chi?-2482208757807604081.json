Spatial proximity queries are commonly built in information seeking tasks especially on online maps. If not impossible, it is hard to formulate spatial proximity queries using existing dynamic query widgets such as range sliders. TrapezoidBox allows users to easily build spatial proximity queries by interactively adjusting a trapezoidal function. Our controlled user study results show that TrapezoidBox has several advantages over a baseline interface with range sliders.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Samsung", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Myoungsu Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Myoungsu", "Bo Hyoung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Bo_Hyoung", "Dong Kyun Jeong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeong:Dong_Kyun", "Yeong-Gil Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Yeong=Gil", "Jinwook Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Jinwook"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
