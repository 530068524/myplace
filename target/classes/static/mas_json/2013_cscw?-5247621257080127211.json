We examine situations in \"triple space\", in which people must manage (1) complex problem-solving tasks, (2) social interaction, and (3) the meaning making process of the changing representation created by others on shared mediums. In this case, the complex problem-solving task is solving a shared Sudoku puzzle. Two findings follow from the current study. People in both the laptop and tablet conditions talked less than people in the paper-control condition, but only people in the laptop condition experienced a significant decrease in positive emotion.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Wuhan University of Technology"], "authors": ["Joon-Suk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joon=Suk", "Deborah G.
