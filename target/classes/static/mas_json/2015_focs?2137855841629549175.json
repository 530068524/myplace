We also obtain near-optimal deterministic lower bounds for the Clique vs. Independent Set problem, which in particular yields new lower bounds for the log-rank conjecture. All these results follow from a simple adaptation of a communication-to-query simulation theorem of Raz and McKenzie (Combinatorica 1999) together with lower bounds for the analogous query complexity questions.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Mika G\u00f6\u00f6s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml==ouml=s:Mika", "Toniann Pitassi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitassi:Toniann", "Thomas Watson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watson_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
