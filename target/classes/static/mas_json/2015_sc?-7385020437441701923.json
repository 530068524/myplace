In order to answer neuroscientific questions efficiently, we are developing a closed-loop analysis system with FCMA on a cluster of nodes with Intel\u00ae Xeon Phi\u2122 coprocessors. Here we propose several ideas for data-driven algorithmic modification to improve the performance on the coprocessor. Our experiments with real datasets show that the optimized single-node code runs 5x-16x faster than the baseline implementation using the well-known Intel\u00ae MKL and LibSVM libraries, and that the cluster implementation achieves near linear speedup on 5760 cores.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Intel", "Princeton University", "Intel", "Princeton University"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Yida Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yida", "Michael J.
