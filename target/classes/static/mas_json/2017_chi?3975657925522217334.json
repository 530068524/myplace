We argue that crowdwork platforms can improve their value proposition for all stakeholders by supporting subcontracting within microtasks. After describing the value proposition of  subcontracting , we then define three models for microtask subcontracting:  real-time assistance, task management , and  task improvement , and reflect on potential use cases and implementation considerations associated with each. Finally, we describe the outcome of two tasks on Mechanical Turk meant to simulate aspects of subcontracting. We reflect on the implications of these findings for the design of future crowd work platforms that effectively harness the potential of subcontracting workflows.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Northwestern University", "University of Washington", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Meredith Ringel Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris:Meredith_Ringel", "Jeffrey P.
