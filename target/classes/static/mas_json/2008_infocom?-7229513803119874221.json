{"title": "A Backup Route Aware Routing Protocol - Fast Recovery from Transient Routing Failures.", "fields": ["enhanced interior gateway routing protocol", "policy based routing", "zone routing protocol", "equal cost multi path routing", "wireless routing protocol"], "abstract": "As the Internet becomes the critical information infrastructure for both personal and business applications, survivable routing protocols need to be designed that maintain the performance of those services in the presence of failures. This paper examines the survivability of interdoamin routing protocols in the presence of routing failure events, and provides a backup route aware routing protocol that performs non-stop routing in the presence of failures. We demonstrate through simulation its effectiveness in preventing packet losses during transient routing failures.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Liberty University", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Feng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0017:Feng", "Lixin Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Lixin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
