Previous studies on teaching dimension focused on version-space learners which maintain all hypotheses consistent with the training data, and cannot be applied to modern machine learners which select a specific hypothesis via optimization. This paper presents the first known teaching dimension for ridge regression, support vector machines, and logistic regression. We also exhibit optimal training sets that match these teaching dimensions. Our approach generalizes to other linear learners.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Rochester", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ji Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ji", "Xiaojin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Xiaojin", "Hrag Ohannessian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohannessian:Hrag"], "pages": 10}
