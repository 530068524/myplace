While a variety of approaches have been proposed for security requirements engineering, we find many still lacking with respect to their usability. In this proposal I describe my work in the area of security requirements engineering. SURE, Secure and Usable Requirements Engineering, is a new approach that supports non-security experts in order to specify security requirements from which testing artifacts can be derived. In addition, ASSURE, Automated Support for Secure and Usable Requirements Engineering, a system that implements the SURE technique is presented.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Jose Romero-Mariona.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romero=Mariona:Jose"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
