The width of a branch decomposition provides a measure of how well the object is decomposed. For many applications it is crucial to compute a branch decomposition whose width is as small as possible. We propose a SAT approach to finding branch decompositions of small width. The core of our approach is an efficient SAT encoding which determines with a single SAT-call whether a given hypergraph admits a branch decomposition of certain width. For our encoding we developed a novel partition-based characterization of branch decomposition. The encoding size imposes a limit on the size of the given hypergraph. In order to break through this barrier and to scale the SAT approach to larger instances, we developed a new heuristic approach where the SAT encoding is used to locally improve a given candidate decomposition until a fixed-point is reached. This new method scales now to instances with several thousands of vertices and edges.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Masaryk University", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Neha Lodha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lodha:Neha", "Sebastian Ordyniak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ordyniak:Sebastian", "Stefan Szeider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szeider:Stefan"], "pages": 5}
