{"title": "Four Factors that Regulate Teen Technology Use in Everyday Life.", "fields": ["everyday life", "information seeking", "qualitative research", "social psychology", "affect"], "abstract": "We examine how teens from an urban area in the Mid-Atlantic region of the USA regulate their use of technology. We framed our research using everyday life information seeking theory [43] and information ecologies [35]. Using a survey, audio and photo diary study, creative free response activity, and semi-structured interviews, we examine teens' perceptions of their everyday life technology use and factors that influence changes in that use, with a focus on understanding non-use, low use, and intentional self-regulation. We describe four factors impacting these practices, including local policies and access, affective factors, life stage and future goals, and relationships. We describe how shifting use practices function in the lives of these teens and discuss the importance of acknowledging teens' skills and preferences for supporting their technology use management.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "authors": ["Rachel M.
