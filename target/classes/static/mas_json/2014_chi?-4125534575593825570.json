The analysis focuses on how interactions and contributions facilitated the emergence of a collective with political will. We lay out an exploration of the intrinsic relationship between cultural memories, cultural expression and everyday politics and show how diverging voices co-constructed dynamic collectives capable of political action. We look at how interactions through the Facebook page challenge traditional ways for conceiving politics and the political. We outline possible research agendas in the field of everyday politics, which are sensitive to the everyday acts of resistance enclosed in the ordinary.", "citation": "Citations (40)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Clara Crivellaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crivellaro:Clara", "Rob Comber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Comber:Rob", "John Bowers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bowers:John", "Peter C.
