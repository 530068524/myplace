{"title": "\"Everybody knows what you're doing\": a critical design approach to personal informatics.", "fields": ["software deployment", "critical design", "engineering informatics", "web navigation", "personal information manager"], "abstract": "We present an alternative approach to the design of personal informatics systems: instead of motivating people to examine their own behaviors, this approach promotes awareness of and reflection on the infrastructures behind personal informatics and the modes of engagement that they promote. Specifically, this paper presents an interface that displays personal web browsing data. The interface aims to reveal underlying infrastructure using several methods: drawing attention to the scope of mined data by displaying deliberately selected sensitive data, using purposeful malfunction as a way to encourage reverse engineering, and challenging normative expectations around data mining by displaying information in unconventional ways. Qualitative results from a two-week deployment show that these strategies can raise people's awareness about data mining, promote efficacy and control over personal data, and inspire reflection on the goals and assumptions embedded in infrastructures for personal data analytics.", "citation": "Citations (61)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Vera D.
