Specifically, for a wide range of the underlying parameters, we show the existence of non-trivial orthogonal arrays,  t -designs, and  t -wise permutations. In all cases, the sizes of the objects are optimal up to polynomial overhead. The proof of existence is probabilistic. We show that a randomly chosen such object has the required properties with positive yet tiny probability. The main technical ingredient is a special local central limit theorem for suitable lattice random walks with finitely many steps.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Greg Kuperberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuperberg:Greg", "Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar", "Ron Peled.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peled:Ron"], "pages": 16}
