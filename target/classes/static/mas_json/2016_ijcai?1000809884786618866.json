However, forgetting in multi-agent modal logics has largely been unexplored. In this paper, we study forgetting in multi-agent modal logics. We adopt the semantic definition of existential bisimulation quantifiers as that of forgetting. We propose a syntactical way of performing forgetting based on the canonical formulas of modal logics introduced by Moss. We show that the result of forgetting a propositional atom from a satisfiable canonical formula can be computed by simply substituting the literals of the atom with T. Thus we show that Kn, Dn, Tn, K45n, KD45n and S5n are closed under forgetting, and hence have uniform interpolation.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "University of Lorraine"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Liangda Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Liangda", "Yongmei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Yongmei", "Hans van Ditmarsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ditmarsch:Hans_van"], "pages": 8}
