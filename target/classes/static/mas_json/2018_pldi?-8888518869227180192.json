Performance modeling for GPUs is done by abstract kernel emulation along with latency/gap modeling of resources. Sensitivity analysis with respect to resource latency/gap parameters is used to predict the bottleneck resource for a given kernel's execution. The utility of the bottleneck analysis is demonstrated in two contexts: 1) Coupling the new bottleneck-driven optimization strategy with the OpenTuner auto-tuner: experimental results on all kernels from the Rodinia suite and GPU tensor contraction kernels from the NWChem computational chemistry suite demonstrate effectiveness. 2) Manual code optimization: two case studies illustrate the use of the bottleneck analysis to iteratively improve the performance of code from state-of-the-art domain-specific code generators.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Changwan Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Changwan", "Aravind Sukumaran-Rajam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sukumaran=Rajam:Aravind", "Jinsung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jinsung", "Prashant Singh Rawat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rawat:Prashant_Singh", "Sriram Krishnamoorthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamoorthy:Sriram", "Louis-No\u00ebl Pouchet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pouchet:Louis=No=euml=l", "Fabrice Rastello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rastello:Fabrice", "P.
