We implement this scheme on our 3DTI platform: the TEEVE Endpoint, which is a runtime engine to handle the creation, transmission and rendering of 3DTI data. User study as well as objective evaluation of the scheme show that it can achieve 25% more bandwidth saving compared to conventional 3D data compression as zlib without perceptible degradation in the user experience.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Chien-Nan (Shannon) Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chien=Nan_=Shannon=", "Pengye Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Pengye", "Klara Nahrstedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nahrstedt:Klara"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
