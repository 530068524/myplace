We consider the case where the structure of the graph to be reconstructed is known to be scale-free. We show that in such cases it is natural to formulate structured sparsity inducing priors using submodular functions, and we use their Lovasz extension to obtain a convex relaxation. For tractable classes such as Gaussian graphical models, this leads to a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved. We show that our method results in an improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed networks for synthetic data. We also show how our prior encourages scale-free reconstructions on a bioinfomatics dataset.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "University of Sydney"], "authors": ["Aaron Defazio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Defazio:Aaron", "Tib\u00e9rio S.
