After 4 months of action science-based activities, such as organized participant observations, in-depth interviews, field work, and focus group studies, the main findings are (1) Web 2.0 suits nonprofit organizations better than traditional webs in terms of maintenance cost and usability, (2) mapping tools make better GUI with respect to web-based housing services, and (3) context-aware personalization can translate to better user experiences as an RDFS-based working prototype has been built and tested. A user survey shows high level user satisfaction. Although the case study was carried in a nonprofit housing organization, the practices in action research approach can be applied to other NPOs as well.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chung Yuan Christian University", "Chung Yuan Christian University", "National Yanh M ... pei, Taiwan Roc"], "authors": ["Yao-Jen Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yao=Jen", "Hsin-Yu Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Hsin=Yu", "Tsen-Yung Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Tsen=Yung"], "conf": "www", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
