The notion is a natural analogue of the notion of *a Lipschitz extension* of a Lipschitz map. We show that for every map  f  there exists an outer bi-Lipschitz extension  f \u2032 whose distortion is greater than that of  f  by at most a constant factor. This result can be seen as a counterpart of the classic Kirszbraun theorem for outer bi-Lipschitz extensions. We also study outer bi-Lipschitz extensions of near-isometric maps and show upper and lower bounds for them. Then, we present applications of our results to prioritized and terminal dimension reduction problems, described next.    We prove a *prioritized* variant of the Johnson\u2013Lindenstrauss lemma: given a set of points  X \u2282 \u211d  d   of size  N  and a permutation (\u201dpriority ranking\u201d) of  X , there exists an embedding  f  of  X  into \u211d  O (log N )  with distortion  O (loglog N ) such that the point of rank  j  has only  O (log 3 + e   j ) non-zero coordinates \u2013 more specifically, all but the first  O (log 3+e   j ) coordinates are equal to 0; the distortion of  f  restricted to the first  j  points (according to the ranking) is at most  O (loglog j ). The result makes a progress towards answering an open question by Elkin, Filtser, and Neiman about prioritized dimension reductions.    We prove that given a set  X  of  N  points in \u211c  d  , there exists a *terminal* dimension reduction embedding of \u211d  d   into \u211d  d \u2032 , where  d \u2032 =  O (log N /e 4 ), which preserves distances || x \u2212 y || between points  x \u2208  X  and  y  \u2208 \u211d  d  , up to a multiplicative factor of 1 \u00b1 e. This improves a recent result by Elkin, Filtser, and Neiman.    The dimension reductions that we obtain are nonlinear, and this nonlinearity is necessary.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Northwestern University", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Sepideh Mahabadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahabadi:Sepideh", "Konstantin Makarychev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makarychev:Konstantin", "Yury Makarychev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makarychev:Yury", "Ilya P.
