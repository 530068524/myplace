It contains videos that capture the interaction from different perspectives and includes synchronised contextual information about the game and the behaviour displayed by the robot. The Inter-ACT corpus is mainly intended to be a comprehensive repository of naturalistic and contextualised, task-dependent data for the training and evaluation of an affect recognition system in an educational game scenario. The richness of contextual data that captures the whole human-robot interaction cycle, together with the fact that the corpus was collected in the same interaction scenario of the target application, make the Inter-ACT corpus unique in its genre.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico", "Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico"], "authors": ["Ginevra Castellano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castellano:Ginevra", "Iolanda Leite.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leite:Iolanda", "Andr\u00e9 Pereira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pereira:Andr=eacute=", "Carlos Martinho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martinho:Carlos", "Ana Paiva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paiva:Ana", "Peter W.
