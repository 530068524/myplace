Our extractor outputs one bit and has polynomially small error. The best previous extractor, by Bourgain, required each source to have min-entropy .499n.     A key ingredient in our construction is an explicit construction of a monotone, almost-balanced Boolean functions that are resilient to coalitions. In fact, our construction is stronger in that it gives an explicit extractor for a generalization of non-oblivious bit-fixing sources on n bits, where some unknown n-q bits are chosen almost polylogarithmic-wise independently, and the remaining q bits are chosen by an adversary as an arbitrary function of the n-q bits. The best previous construction, by Viola, achieved q quadratically smaller than our result.     Our explicit two-source extractor directly implies improved constructions of a K-Ramsey graph over N vertices, improving bounds obtained by Barak et al. and matching independent work by Cohen.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Eshan Chattopadhyay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chattopadhyay:Eshan", "David Zuckerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuckerman:David"], "pages": 14}
