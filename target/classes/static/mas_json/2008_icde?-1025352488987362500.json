{"title": "Robust Stratified Sampling Plans for Low Selectivity Queries.", "fields": ["selectivity", "stratified sampling", "robustness", "nonprobability sampling", "bayesian probability"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. Traditional sampling techniques can be ineffective for such a problem since a small random sample is likely to miss most or even all of the records satisfying the restrictive selection predicate. Stratfied sampling is useful in this situation, but a key problem in applying stratified sampling effectively is identifying which strata are important and developing a sampling plan that favors those strata in a robust fashion. We develop a solution to this problem that combines any prior knowledge or expectation about the stratification with information obtained from pilot sampling in a principled Bayesian framework.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Shantanu Joshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joshi_0001:Shantanu", "Christopher M.
