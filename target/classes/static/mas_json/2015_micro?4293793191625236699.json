{"title": "The CRISP performance model for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling in a GPGPU.", "fields": ["frequency scaling", "scaling", "controller", "general purpose computing on graphics processing units", "computation"], "abstract": "This paper presents CRISP, the first runtime analytical model of performance in the face of changing frequency in a GPGPU. It shows that prior models not targeted at a GPGPU fail to account for important characteristics of GPGPU execution, including the high degree of overlap between memory access and computation and the frequency of store-related stalls.   CRISP provides significantly greater accuracy than prior runtime performance models, being within 4% on average when scaling frequency by up to 7X. Using CRISP to drive a runtime energy efficiency controller yields a 10.7% improvement in energy-delay product, vs 6.2% attainable via the best prior performance model.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Rajib Nath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nath:Rajib", "Dean M.
