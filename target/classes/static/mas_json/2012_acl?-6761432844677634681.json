In this paper, we propose a new class of kernel functions, referred to as string re-writing kernel, to address the problem. A string re-writing kernel measures the similarity between two pairs of strings, each pair representing re-writing of a string. It can capture the lexical and structural similarity between two pairs of sentences without the need of constructing syntactic trees. We further propose an instance of string re-writing kernel which can be computed efficiently. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve better results than state-of-the-art methods on two sentence re-writing learning tasks: paraphrase identification and recognizing textual entailment.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Microsoft", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Fan Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Fan", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hang", "Xiaoyan Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiaoyan"], "pages": 10}
