{"title": "Simple Local Models for Complex Dynamical Systems.", "fields": ["machine learning", "formalism", "dynamical systems theory", "artificial intelligence", "dynamical system"], "abstract": "We present a novel mathematical formalism for the idea of a \"local model\" of an uncontrolled dynamical system, a model that makes only certain predictions in only certain situations. As a result of its restricted responsibilities, a local model may be far simpler than a complete model of the system. We then show how one might combine several local models to produce a more detailed model. We demonstrate our ability to learn a collection of local models on a large-scale example and do a preliminary empirical comparison of learning a collection of local models and some other model learning methods.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Erik Talvitie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talvitie:Erik", "Satinder P.
