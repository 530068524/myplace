We address this problem by utilizing the reconstruction errors of an autoencoder. We observe that when data are reconstructed from low-dimensional representations, the inliers and the outliers can be well separated according to their reconstruction errors. Based on this basic observation, we gradually inject discriminative information in the learning process of an autoencoder to make the inliers and the outliers more separable. Experiments on a variety of image datasets validate our approach.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yan Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Yan", "Xudong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xudong", "Fang Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Fang", "Gang Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Gang", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian"], "pages": 9}
