In this paper, we focus on a family of flow-size estimation algorithms we call Residual-Geometric Sampling (RGS), which generates a random point within each flow according to a geometric random variable and records all remaining packets in a flow counter. Our analytical investigation shows that previous estimation algorithms based on this method exhibit bias in recovering flow statistics from the sampled measurements. To address this problem, we derive a novel set of unbiased estimators for RGS, validate them using real Internet traces, and show that they provide an accurate and scalable solution to Internet traffic monitoring.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Amazon.com", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Seattle, WA 98101 USA"], "authors": ["Xiaoming Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Xiaoming", "Xiaoyong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0004:Xiaoyong", "Dmitri Loguinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loguinov:Dmitri"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
