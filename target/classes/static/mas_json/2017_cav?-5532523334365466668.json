Its goal is to identify typical faults that occur in the process of formalizing requirements by mutating a candidate specification. STLInspector computes a series of representative signals that enables a requirements engineer to validate a candidate specification against all its mutated variants, thus achieving full mutation coverage. By visual inspection of the signals via a web-based GUI, an engineer can obtain high confidence in the correctness of the formalization \u2013 even if she is not familiar with STL. STLInspector makes the assessment of formal specifications accessible to a wide range of developers in industry, hence contributes to leveraging the use of formal specifications and computer-aided verification in industrial practice. We apply the tool to several collections of STL formulas and show its effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Bosch", "Bosch", "University of T\u00fcbingen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Hendrik Roehm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roehm:Hendrik", "Thomas Heinz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinz_0001:Thomas", "Eva Charlotte Mayer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayer:Eva_Charlotte"], "pages": 8}
