It defines a cipher E from t fixed public permutations P 1,..., P t : {0,1} n \u2192 {0,1} n and a key k = k 0 \u2225 ... \u2225 k t \u2208 {0,1} n(t + 1) by setting E k (x) = k t \u2295 P t (k t \u2212 1 \u2295 P t \u2212 1( \u22ef k 1 \u2295 P 1(k 0 \u2295 x) \u22ef )). The indistinguishability of E k from a truly random permutation by an adversary who also has oracle access to the (public) random permutations P 1, \u2026, P t was investigated in 1997 by Even and Mansour for t = 1 and for higher values of t in a series of recent papers. For t = 1, Even and Mansour proved indistinguishability security up to 2 n/2 queries, which is tight. Much later Bogdanov et al. (2011) conjectured that security should be \\(2^{\\frac{t}{t+1}n}\\) queries for general t, which matches an easy distinguishing attack (so security cannot be more). A number of partial results have been obtained supporting this conjecture, besides Even and Mansour\u2019s original result for t = 1: Bogdanov et al. proved security of \\(2^{\\frac{2}{3}n}\\) for t \u2265 2, Steinberger (2012) proved security of \\(2^{\\frac{3}{4}n}\\) for t \u2265 3, and Lampe, Patarin and Seurin (2012) proved security of \\(2^{\\frac{t}{t+2}n}\\) for all even values of t, thus \u201cbarely\u201d falling short of the desired \\(2^{\\frac{t}{t+1}n}\\).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Shan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shan", "John P.
