Our journey takes in a number of concepts from the computer science logician's toolkit -- including categorical logic and model theory, denotational semantics, the Curry-Howard isomorphism, sub structural logic, Hoare Logic and Separation Logic, abstract interpretation, compositional program analysis, the frame problem, and abductive inference.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University College London"], "authors": ["Peter W.
