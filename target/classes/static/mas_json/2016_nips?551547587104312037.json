{"title": "Review Networks for Caption Generation.", "fields": ["machine learning", "source code", "encoder", "special case", "closed captioning"], "abstract": "We propose a novel extension of the encoder-decoder framework, called a review network. The review network is generic and can enhance any existing encoder- decoder model: in this paper, we consider RNN decoders with both CNN and RNN encoders. The review network performs a number of review steps with attention mechanism on the encoder hidden states, and outputs a thought vector after each review step; the thought vectors are used as the input of the attention mechanism in the decoder. We show that conventional encoder-decoders are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we show that our framework improves over state-of- the-art encoder-decoder systems on the tasks of image captioning and source code captioning.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Zhilin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhilin", "Ye Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Ye", "Yuexin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yuexin", "William W.
