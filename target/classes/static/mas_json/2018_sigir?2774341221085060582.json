{"title": "What Do Viewers Say to Their TVs?: An Analysis of Voice Queries to Entertainment Systems.", "fields": ["computer science", "information retrieval", "intelligent agent", "direct navigation", "entertainment"], "abstract": "A recently-introduced product of Comcast, a large cable company in the United States, is a \"voice remote\" that accepts spoken queries from viewers. We present an analysis of a large query log from this service to answer the question: \"What do viewers say to their TVs?\" In addition to a descriptive characterization of queries and sessions, we describe two complementary types of analyses to support query understanding. First, we propose a domain-specific intent taxonomy to characterize viewer behavior: as expected, most intents revolve around watching programs---both direct navigation as well as browsing---but there is a non-trivial fraction of non-viewing intents as well. Second, we propose a domain-specific tagging scheme for labeling query tokens, that when combined with intent and program prediction, provides a multi-faceted approach to understand voice queries directed at entertainment systems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Waterloo", "Comcast Applied ... ington, DC, USA"], "authors": ["Jinfeng Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Jinfeng", "Ferhan T\u00fcre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/T=uuml=re:Ferhan", "Jimmy Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Jimmy"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
