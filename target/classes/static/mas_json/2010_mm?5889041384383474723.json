{"title": "Similarity content search in content centric networks.", "fields": ["network address", "network architecture", "content farm", "content management", "content centric networking"], "abstract": "Content searching and downloading are the two dominant actions of the Internet users today, despite the fact that the Internet was not originally architected to serve such actions. Content Centric Networking is the new trend in the research community to build network architectures that route content by name and not by the host's network address so as to efficiently deal with content persistence, availability and authenticity issues. In this work we propose an extension to the Content Centric Network protocol in order to support content search as a native process of the network. By using object descriptors to represent the actual content objects and integrate these descriptors in the network protocol we manage to search and retrieve content from the network not only by name but also by the content itself. In this approach, searching for information is a process distributed to the reachable network. Moreover, content aggregation is handled by the end user and not by content aggregation portals, thematic content search engines or information curators. By doing so, search is not any more an application but part of the network and can pave the way for many novel applications which have never been thought until today.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Centre for Rese ... aloniki, Greece", "Centre for Rese ... aloniki, Greece", "Centre for Rese ... aloniki, Greece", "Centre for Rese ... aloniki, Greece"], "authors": ["Petros Daras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daras:Petros", "Theodoros Semertzidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Semertzidis:Theodoros", "Lambros Makris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makris:Lambros", "Michael G.
