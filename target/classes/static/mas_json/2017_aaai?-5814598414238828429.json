The proposed Low-Rank Hawkes Process (LRHP) framework introduces a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix that allows to perform the nonparametric learning of the $d^2$ triggering kernels using at most $O(ndr^2)$ operations, where $r$ is the rank of the approximation ($r \\ll d,n$). This comes as a major improvement to the existing state-of-the-art inference algorithms that are in $O(nd^2)$. Furthermore, the low-rank approximation allows LRHP to learn representative patterns of interaction between event types, which may be valuable for the analysis of such complex processes in real world datasets. The efficiency and scalability of our approach is illustrated with numerical experiments on simulated as well as real datasets.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"], "authors": ["R\u00e9mi Lemonnier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lemonnier:R=eacute=mi", "Kevin Scaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scaman:Kevin", "Argyris Kalogeratos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalogeratos:Argyris"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
