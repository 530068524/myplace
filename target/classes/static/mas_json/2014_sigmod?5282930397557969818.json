As a consequence, modern database systems will need to be able to adapt to a wide variety of heterogeneous architectures. While porting single operators to accelerator architectures is well-understood, a more generic approach is needed for the whole database system. In prior work, we presented a generic hardware-oblivious database system, where the operators can be executed on the main processor as well as on a large number of accelerator architectures. However, to achieve fully heterogeneous query processing, placement decisions are needed for the database operators. We enhance the presented system with heterogeneity-aware operator placement (HOP) to take a major step towards designing a database system that can efficiently exploit highly heterogeneous hardware environments. In this demonstration, we are focusing on the placement-integration aspect as well as presenting the resulting database system.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Tomas Karnagel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karnagel:Tomas", "Matthias Hille.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hille:Matthias", "Mario Ludwig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ludwig:Mario", "Dirk Habich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habich:Dirk", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang", "Max Heimel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heimel:Max", "Volker Markl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markl:Volker"], "pages": 4}
