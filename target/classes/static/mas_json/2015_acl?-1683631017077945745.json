Our method extracts and enriches sentences that refer to an entity pair from a corpus and ranks the sentences according to how well they describe the relationship between the entities. We model this task as a learning to rank problem for sentences and employ a rich set of features. When evaluated on a large set of manually annotated sentences, we find that our method significantly improves over state-of-the-art baseline models.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "Yahoo!", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Nikos Voskarides.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voskarides:Nikos", "Edgar Meij.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meij:Edgar", "Manos Tsagkias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsagkias:Manos", "Maarten de Rijke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rijke:Maarten_de", "Wouter Weerkamp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weerkamp:Wouter"], "pages": 11}
