While there has been progress on equi-joins, implementation of join algorithms in MapReduce in general is not sufficiently understood. We study the problem of how to map arbitrary join conditions to Map and Reduce functions, i.e., a parallel infrastructure that controls data flow based on key-equality only. Our proposed join model simplifies creation of and reasoning about joins in MapReduce. Using this model, we derive a surprisingly simple randomized algorithm, called 1-Bucket-Theta, for implementing arbitrary joins (theta-joins) in a single MapReduce job. This algorithm only requires minimal statistics (input cardinality) and we provide evidence that for a variety of join problems, it is either close to optimal or the best possible option. For some of the problems where 1-Bucket-Theta is not the best choice, we show how to achieve better performance by exploiting additional input statistics. All algorithms can be made 'memory-aware', and they do not require any modifications to the MapReduce environment. Experiments show the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (291)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Alper Okcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okcan:Alper", "Mirek Riedewald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riedewald:Mirek"], "pages": 12}
