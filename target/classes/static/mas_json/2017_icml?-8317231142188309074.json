We propose algorithms $\\mathtt{LazyEV}$ and $\\mathtt{LazyCCA}$ to solve the two problems with running times linearly dependent on the input size and on $k$. \nFurthermore, our algorithms are DOUBLY-ACCELERATED: our running times depend only on the square root of the matrix condition number, and on the square root of the eigengap. This is the first such result for both $k$-GenEV or $k$-CCA. We also provide the first gap-free results, which provide running times that depend on $1/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$ rather than the eigengap.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Zeyuan Allen-Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Allen=Zhu:Zeyuan", "Yuanzhi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuanzhi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
