Context information is automatically collected for a mobile device via mobile-device sensors. When a task is received that specifies context-related criteria, a worker is selected for that task based at least in part upon the context information associated with that worker's mobile device. Sensors on the device may be leveraged to capture information related to performing the task. Also described is a cross-platform task configuration that allows a task to be written once and run on different mobile device platforms.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Trento", "University of Trento", "University of Trento", "CREATE-NET, Povo, Trento", "CREATE-NET, Povo, Trento"], "authors": ["Andrei Tamilin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamilin:Andrei", "Iacopo Carreras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carreras:Iacopo", "Emmanuel Ssebaggala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Ssebaggala:Emmanuel", "Alfonse Opira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Opira:Alfonse", "Nicola Conci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conci:Nicola"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
