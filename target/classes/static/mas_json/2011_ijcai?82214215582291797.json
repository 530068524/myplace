{"title": "Agent-Oriented Incremental Team and Activity Recognition.", "fields": ["team composition", "activity recognition", "anticipation", "conditional random field", "team effectiveness"], "abstract": "Monitoring team activity is beneficial when human teams cooperate in the enactment of a joint plan. Monitoring allows teams to maintain awareness of each other's progress within the plan and it enables anticipation of information needs. Humans find this difficult, particularly in time-stressed and uncertain environments. In this paper we introduce a probabilistic model, based on Conditional Random Fields, to automatically recognise the composition of teams and the team activities in relation to a plan. The team composition and activities are recognised incrementally by interpreting a stream of spatio-temporal observations.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Aberdeen", "University of Aberdeen", "University of Aberdeen", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Daniele Masato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masato:Daniele", "Timothy J.
