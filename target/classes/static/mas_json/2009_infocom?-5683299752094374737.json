The capacity in our analysis is the end-to-end per-node throughput. Our analysis is based on the assumption that there is only one gateway in the network and all end-users' traffics go through the gateway. Non-gateway nodes are uniformly distributed in a two- dimensional region centered at the gateway. The main results of our analysis can be summarized as: 1) The capacity is O(1/N) for both omni and directional antennas, where N is number of nodes in the network. 2) the capacity is O(1g m/thetas) for m = 2, and O(1g m/thetas 2  1g (1/thetas)) for m > 2, where m is the number of antennas on each node, and thetas is the beamwidth of antennas.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Jun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0019:Jun", "Xiaohua Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Xiaohua"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
