{"title": "Resilient Routing for Sensor Networks Using Hyperbolic Embedding of Universal Covering Space.", "fields": ["greedy algorithm", "hyperbolic space", "homotopy", "embedding", "covering space"], "abstract": "We study how to characterize the families of paths between any two nodes $s, t$ in a sensor network with holes. Two paths that can be deformed to one another through local changes are called \\emph{homotopy equivalent}. Two paths that pass around holes in different ways have different \\emph{homotopy types}. With a distributed algorithm we compute an embedding of the network in hyperbolic space by using Ricci flow such that paths of different homotopy types are mapped naturally to paths connecting $s$ with different images of $t$. Greedy routing to a particular image is guaranteed with success to find a path with a given homotopy type. This leads to simple greedy routing algorithms that are resilient to both local link dynamics and large scale jamming attacks and improve load balancing over previous greedy routing algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Rutgers University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "authors": ["Wei Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Wei", "Rik Sarkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarkar:Rik", "Feng Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo_0002:Feng", "Xianfeng Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Xianfeng", "Jie Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jie"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
