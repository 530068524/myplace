{"title": "The Cost of Serializability on Platforms That Use Snapshot Isolation.", "fields": ["serialization", "correctness", "serializability", "snapshot isolation", "concurrency control"], "abstract": "Several common DBMS engines use the multi- version concurrency control mechanism called Snapshot Isolation, even though application programs can experience non- serializable executions when run concurrently on such a platform. Several proposals exist for modifying the application programs, without changing their semantics, so that they are certain to execute serializably even on an engine that uses SI. We evaluate the performance impact of these proposals, and find that some have limited impact (only a few percent drop in throughput at a given multi-programming level) while others lead to much greater reduction in throughput of up-to 60% in high contention scenarios. We present experimental results for both an open- source and a commercial engine. We relate these to the theory, giving guidelines on which conflicts to introduce so as to ensure correctness with little impact on performance.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Information Technology University", "Information Technology University", "Information Technology University", "Information Technology University"], "authors": ["Mohammad Alomari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alomari:Mohammad", "Michael J.
