The randomness of state transitions and rewards implies that the performance of a policy is often stochastic. In contrast to the standard approach that studies the expected performance, we consider the policy that maximizes the probability of achieving a pre-determined target performance, a criterion we term probabilistic goal Markov decision processes. We show that this problem is NP-hard, but can be solved using a pseudo-polynomial algorithm. We further consider a variant dubbed \"chance-constraint Markov decision problems,\" that treats the probability of achieving target performance as a constraint instead of the maximizing objective. This variant is NP-hard, but can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan", "Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie"], "pages": 7}
