{"title": "Opportunities exist: continuous discovery of places to perform activities.", "fields": ["location awareness", "business process discovery", "cognitive map", "software deployment", "mobile search"], "abstract": "A rich cognitive map of a space can enhance the individual's experience within the space. However, cognitive maps develop gradually through repeated experience; and because of this, on-demand mobile search services ( e.g. , Google Maps, Yelp) are often used to compensate for missing knowledge. In this work, we developed and evaluated a context-aware place discovery application called Opportunities Exist to assist in the acquisition of spatial knowledge and meaning. The application differs from traditional search in that places are discovered using an activity ( e.g. , drink coffee, sit in the sun) and the discovery process runs continuously, maintaining a history of places the user can perform her activities as she goes about her day. We conducted a 4-week deployment in two North American cities. The results show that users were able to discover new places to perform their activities in familiar spaces and learned to associate new activities with familiar places. In addition, participants leveraged the application to perform activities opportunistically, and used continuous place discovery as an opportunistic reminder of routines they wanted to break out of or resume.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Nokia", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David Dearman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dearman:David", "Timothy Sohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sohn:Timothy", "Khai N.
