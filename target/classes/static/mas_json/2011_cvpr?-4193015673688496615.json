We formulate the problem as segment selection from a pool of segments, assigning each selected segment a class label. Previous multiple segmentation approaches used local appearance matching to select segments in a greedy manner. In contrast, our approach formulates a cost function based on contextual information in conjunction with appearance matching. This relaxed cost function formulation is minimized using an efficient quadratic programming solver and an approximate solution is obtained by discretizing the relaxed solution. Our approach improves labeling performance compared to other segmentation based recognition approaches.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0016:Xi", "Arpit Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Arpit", "Abhinav Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Abhinav", "Larry S.
