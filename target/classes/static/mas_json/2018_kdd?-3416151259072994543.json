We focus on counting the number of occurrences of a \"butterfly\", a complete 2x2 biclique, the simplest cohesive higher-order structure in a bipartite graph. Our main contribution is a suite of randomized algorithms that can quickly approximate the number of butterflies in a graph with a provable guarantee on accuracy. An experimental evaluation on large real-world networks shows that our algorithms return accurate estimates within a few seconds, even for networks with trillions of butterflies and hundreds of millions of edges.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "University at Buffalo", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Seyed-Vahid Sanei-Mehri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanei=Mehri:Seyed=Vahid", "Ahmet Erdem Sariy\u00fcce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sariy=uuml=ce:Ahmet_Erdem", "Srikanta Tirthapura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tirthapura:Srikanta"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
