{"title": "SPECS: A Lightweight Runtime Mechanism for Protecting Software from Security-Critical Processor Bugs.", "fields": ["computer science", "real time computing", "software", "parallel computing", "limiting"], "abstract": "Processor implementation errata remain a problem, and worse, a subset of these bugs are security-critical. We classified 7 years of errata from recent commercial processors to understand the magnitude and severity of this problem, and found that of 301 errata analyzed, 28 are security-critical. We propose the SECURITY-CRITICAL PROCESSOR ER- RATA CATCHING SYSTEM (SPECS) as a low-overhead solution to this problem. SPECS employs a dynamic verification strategy that is made lightweight by limiting protection to only security-critical processor state. As a proof-of- concept, we implement a hardware prototype of SPECS in an open source processor. Using this prototype, we evaluate SPECS against a set of 14 bugs inspired by the types of security-critical errata we discovered in the classification phase. The evaluation shows that SPECS is 86% effective as a defense when deployed using only ISA-level state; incurs less than 5% area and power overhead; and has no software run-time overhead.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Twitter", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Matthew Hicks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hicks:Matthew", "Cynthia Sturton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sturton:Cynthia", "Samuel T.
