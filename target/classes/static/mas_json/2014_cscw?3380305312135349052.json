We propose the Affec-tive Benefits and Costs of Communication Technologies (ABCCT) questionnaire to supplement traditional qualita-tive methods of understanding communication media. We discuss the pilots of this survey with 45 children and 110 adults measuring the inter-item reliability of this instru-ment. We present the results of interviews with 14 children and 14 adults, which help confirm that the ABCCT measures the same constructs that may emerge through interview investigations. Finally, we demonstrate that the ABCCT is sensitive enough to discriminate between differ-ent communication technologies and has shown promise in some of its early adoption. Though the ABCCT is not with-out limitations, it may provide a way to compare technolo-gies in field deployments, draw findings across investiga-tions, and quantify the impact of specific design decisions.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["AT&T", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Svetlana Yarosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yarosh:Svetlana", "Panos Markopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markopoulos:Panos", "Gregory D.
