In this work, we propose a new approach to automatically constructing inductive loop invariants. The key idea is to aggressively squeeze an inductive invariant based on Craig interpolants between forward and backward reachability analysis. We have evaluated our approach by a set of loop benchmarks, and experimental results show that our approach is promising.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Shang-Wei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Shang=Wei", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Hao Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Hao", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Yang", "David San\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/San=aacute=n:David", "Henri Hansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hansen:Henri"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
