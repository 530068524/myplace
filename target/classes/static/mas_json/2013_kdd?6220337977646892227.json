However, if the graph dataset contains sensitive data of individuals such as mobile phone-call graphs and web-click graphs, releasing discovered frequent patterns may present a threat to the privacy of individuals.  Differential privacy  has recently emerged as the  de facto  standard for private data analysis due to its provable privacy guarantee. In this paper we propose the first differentially private algorithm for mining frequent graph patterns.   We first show that previous techniques on differentially private discovery of frequent  itemsets  cannot apply in mining frequent graph patterns due to the inherent complexity of handling structural information in graphs. We then address this challenge by proposing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling based algorithm. Unlike previous work on frequent itemset mining, our techniques do not rely on the output of a non-private mining algorithm. Instead, we observe that both frequent graph pattern mining and the guarantee of differential privacy can be unified into an MCMC sampling framework. In addition, we establish the privacy and utility guarantee of our algorithm and propose an efficient neighboring pattern counting technique as well. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to output frequent patterns with good precision.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Entong Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Entong", "Ting Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Ting"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
