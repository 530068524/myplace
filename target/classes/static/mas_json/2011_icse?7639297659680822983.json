To address this issue, we present an approach for automatically anonymizing failure-inducing inputs that builds on a previously developed technique. Given an input  I  that causes a failure  f , our approach generates an anonymized input  I \u2032 that is different from  I  but still causes  f .  I \u2032 can thus be sent to developers to enable them to debug  f  without having to know  I . We implemented our approach in a prototype tool,  camouflage , and performed an extensive empirical evaluation where we applied  camouflage  to a large set of failure-inducing inputs for several real applications. The results of the evaluation are promising, as they show that  camouflage  is both practical and effective at generating anonymized inputs; for the inputs that we considered,  I  and  I \u2032 shared no sensitive information. The results also show that our approach can outperform the general technique it extends.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["University of Delaware", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["James A.
