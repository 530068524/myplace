Current methods rely on costly descriptors for detection and matching. In this paper, we propose a very fast binary descriptor based on BRIEF, called ORB, which is rotation invariant and resistant to noise. We demonstrate through experiments how ORB is at two orders of magnitude faster than SIFT, while performing as well in many situations. The efficiency is tested on several real-world applications, including object detection and patch-tracking on a smart phone.", "citation": "Citations (4,211)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Willow Garage", "Willow Garage", "Willow Garage", "Willow Garage"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ethan Rublee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rublee:Ethan", "Vincent Rabaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabaud:Vincent", "Kurt Konolige.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konolige:Kurt", "Gary R.
