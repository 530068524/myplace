{"title": "Online Learning with a Hint.", "fields": ["polyhedron", "regular polygon", "linear programming", "convex function", "regret"], "abstract": "We study a variant of online linear optimization where the player receives a hint about the loss function at the beginning of each round. The hint is given in the form of a vector that is weakly correlated with the loss vector on that round. We show that the player can benefit from such a hint if the set of feasible actions is sufficiently round. Specifically, if the set is strongly convex, the hint can be used to guarantee a regret of O(log(T)), and if the set is q-uniformly convex for q\\in(2,3), the hint can be used to guarantee a regret of o(sqrt{T}). In contrast, we establish Omega(sqrt{T}) lower bounds on regret when the set of feasible actions is a polyhedron.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ofer Dekel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dekel:Ofer", "Arthur Flajolet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flajolet:Arthur", "Nika Haghtalab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haghtalab:Nika", "Patrick Jaillet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaillet:Patrick"], "pages": 10}
