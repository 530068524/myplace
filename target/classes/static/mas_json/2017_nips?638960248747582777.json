Predicting user activities based on point processes is a central problem. However, existing works are mostly problem specific, use heuristics, or simplify the stochastic nature of point processes. In this paper, we propose a framework that provides an unbiased estimator of the probability mass function of point processes. In particular, we design a key reformulation of the prediction problem, and further derive a differential-difference equation to compute a conditional probability mass function. Our framework is applicable to general point processes and prediction tasks, and achieves superb predictive and efficiency performance in diverse real-world applications compared to state-of-arts.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia State University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yichen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yichen", "Xiaojing Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Xiaojing", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le"], "pages": 11}
