While variations due to scale and rotation have been examined, there is a lack of practical solutions for more complex deformations such as affine transformations because of the tremendous size of the associated solution space. To address this problem, we present a discrete-continuous transformation matching (DCTM) framework where dense affine transformation fields are inferred through a discrete label optimization in which the labels are iteratively updated via continuous regularization. In this way, our approach draws solutions from the continuous space of affine transformations in a manner that can be computed efficiently through constant-time edge-aware filtering and a proposed affine-varying CNN-based descriptor. Experimental results show that this model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for dense semantic correspondence on various benchmarks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Yonsei University", "Chungnam National University", "Microsoft", "Yonsei University", "Yonsei University", "Chungnam National University", "Microsoft", "Yonsei University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Seungryong Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seungryong", "Dongbo Min.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Min:Dongbo", "Stephen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Stephen", "Kwanghoon Sohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sohn:Kwanghoon"], "pages": 10}
