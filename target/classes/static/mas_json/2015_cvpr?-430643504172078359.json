In this paper we propose to embrace a fully non-parametric model for the imaging and we show that it can be properly calibrated with little effort using a dense active target. This process produces a dense set of independent rays that cannot be directly used to produce a conventional image. However, they are an ideal tool for 3D reconstruction tasks, since they are highly redundant, very accurate and they cover a wide range of different baselines. The feasibility and convenience of the process and the accuracy of the obtained calibration are comprehensively evaluated through several experiments.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Ca' Foscari University of Venice", "Ca' Foscari University of Venice", "Ca' Foscari University of Venice", "Ca' Foscari University of Venice", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Filippo Bergamasco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergamasco:Filippo", "Andrea Albarelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albarelli:Andrea", "Luca Cosmo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cosmo:Luca", "Andrea Torsello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torsello:Andrea", "Emanuele Rodol\u00e0.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodol=agrave=:Emanuele", "Daniel Cremers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cremers:Daniel"], "pages": 10}
