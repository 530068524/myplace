{"title": "Classification with scattering operators.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "wavelet transform", "invariant", "model selection", "image texture"], "abstract": "A scattering vector is a local descriptor including multiscale and multi-direction co-occurrence information. It is computed with a cascade of wavelet decompositions and complex modulus. This scattering representation is locally translation invariant and linearizes deformations. A supervised classification algorithm is computed with a PCA model selection on scattering vectors. State of the art results are obtained for handwritten digit recognition and texture classification.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Joan Bruna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruna:Joan", "St\u00e9phane Mallat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mallat:St=eacute=phane"], "pages": 6}
