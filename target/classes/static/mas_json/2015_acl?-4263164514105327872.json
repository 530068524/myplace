In this work, we explore linguistic cues that presage such transitions by studying dyadic interactions in an online strategy game where players form alliances and break those alliances through betrayal. We characterize friendships that are unlikely to last and examine temporal patterns that foretell betrayal. \nWe reveal that subtle signs of imminent betrayal are encoded in the conversational patterns of the dyad, even if the victim is not aware of the relationship's fate. In particular, we find that lasting friendships exhibit a form of balance that manifests itself through language. In contrast, sudden changes in the balance of certain conversational attributes---such as positive sentiment, politeness, or focus on future planning---signal impending betrayal.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Cornell University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Cornell University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Vlad Niculae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niculae:Vlad", "Srijan Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Srijan", "Jordan L.
