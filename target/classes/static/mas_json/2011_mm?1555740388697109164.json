We are interested in the question whether crowdsourcing can be beneficial to a video search engine that automatically recognizes video fragments on a semantic level. To answer this question, we perform a 3-month online field study with a concert video search engine targeted at a dedicated user-community of pop concert enthusiasts. We harvest the feedback of more than 500 active users and perform two experiments. In experiment 1 we measure user incentive to provide feedback, in experiment 2 we determine the tradeoff between feedback quality and quantity when aggregated over multiple users. Results show that users provide sufficient feedback, which becomes highly reliable when a crowd agreement of 67% is enforced.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "University of Amsterdam", "Video Dock, Ams ... am, Netherlands"], "authors": ["Bauke Freiburg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freiburg:Bauke", "Jaap Kamps.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamps:Jaap", "Cees G.
