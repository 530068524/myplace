We take advantage of the multi-touch surface to combine biometric techniques with gestural input. We defined a comprehensive set of five-finger touch gestures, based upon classifying movement characteristics of the center of the palm and fingertips, and tested them in a user study combining biometric data collection with usability questions. Using pattern recognition techniques, we built a classifier to recognize unique biometric gesture characteristics of an individual. We achieved a 90% accuracy rate with single gestures, and saw significant improvement when multiple gestures were performed in sequence. We found user ratings of a gestures desirable characteristics (ease, pleasure, excitement) correlated with a gestures actual biometric recognition rate - that is to say, user ratings aligned well with gestural security, in contrast to typical text-based passwords. Based on these results, we conclude that multi-touch gestures show great promise as an authentication mechanism.", "citation": "Citations (265)", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "authors": ["Napa Sae-Bae.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sae=Bae:Napa", "Kowsar Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Kowsar", "Katherine Isbister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isbister:Katherine", "Nasir D.
