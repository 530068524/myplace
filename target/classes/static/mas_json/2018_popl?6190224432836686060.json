In this paper, we propose a new loop fusion strategy, which can fuse  any  loops\u2014even loops with data dependence\u2014and show that it is useful for program verification because it can simplify loop invariants.   The crux of our loop fusion is the following observation: if the state after the first loop were known, the two loop bodies could be computed at the same time without suffering from data dependence by renaming program variables. Our loop fusion produces a program that  guesses  the unknown state after the first loop nondeterministically, executes the fused loop where variables are renamed, compares the guessed state and the state actually computed by the fused loop, and, if they do not match, diverges. The last two steps of comparison and divergence are crucial to preserve partial correctness. We call our approach \u201cguess-and-assume\u201d because, in addition to the first step to guess, the last two steps can be expressed by the pseudo-instruction  assume , used in program verification.   We formalize our loop fusion for a simple imperative language and prove that it preserves partial correctness. We further extend the \u201cguess-and-assume\u201d technique to reversing loop execution, which is useful to verify a certain type of consecutive loops. Finally, we confirm by experiments that our transformation techniques are indeed effective for state-of-the-art model checkers to verify a few small programs that they could not.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "Kyoto University", "Kyoto University"], "authors": ["Akifumi Imanishi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Imanishi:Akifumi", "Kohei Suenaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suenaga:Kohei", "Atsushi Igarashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Igarashi:Atsushi"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2018", "pages": 13}
