The core idea of our proposed algorithm lies in that each station needs to select an appropriate contention window size so as to fairly share the channel occupancy time and maximize the throughput under the time fairness constraint. The derivation of the proper contention window size is presented rigorously. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm through an extensive simulation study, and the evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm leads to nearly perfect time fairness, high throughput, and low collision overhead.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["George Washington University", "Texas Christian University", "George Washington University", "George Washington University", "University of Macau"], "authors": ["Yuan Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Yuan", "Liran Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Liran", "Wei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wei", "Xiuzhen Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiuzhen", "Biao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Biao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
