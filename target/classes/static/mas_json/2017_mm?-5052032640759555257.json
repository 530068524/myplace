Inspired by the latest advance in the asymmetric hashing scheme, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Asymmetric Pairwise Hashing approach (DAPH) for supervised hashing. The core idea is that two deep convolutional models are jointly trained such that their output codes for a pair of images can well reveal the similarity indicated by their semantic labels. A pairwise loss is elaborately designed to preserve the pairwise similarities between images as well as incorporating the independence and balance hash code learning criteria. By taking advantage of the flexibility of asymmetric hash functions, we devise an efficient alternating algorithm to optimize the asymmetric deep hash functions and high-quality binary code jointly. Experiments on three image benchmarks show that DAPH achieves the state-of-the-art performance on large-scale image retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of East Anglia", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Fumin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Fumin", "Xin Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Xin", "Li Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0004:Li", "Yang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yang", "Heng Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Heng_Tao"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
