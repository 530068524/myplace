In this paper, we provide a new information model for the geographic greedy forwarding routing that only forwards the packet within the so-called request zone. Under this new information model, the hole and its affected area are identified easily and quickly in an unsafe area with a labeling process. The greedy forwarding will be blocked if and only if a node inside the unsafe area is used. Due to the shape of the request zone, an unsafe area can be estimated as a rectangular region in the local view of unsafe nodes. With such estimate information, the new routing method proposed in this paper will avoid blocking by holes and achieve better performance in routing time while the cost of information construction is greatly reduced compared with the best results known to date.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["West Chester University of Pennsylvania", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Florida Atlantic University"], "authors": ["Zhen Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Zhen", "Junchao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Junchao", "Wei Lou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lou:Wei", "Jie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Jie"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
