The CNN model is exploited to learn high-level representations from the social cues of the data. These high-level representations are used in XGBoost to predict the popularity of the social posts. We evaluate our approach on a real-world Social Media Prediction (SMP) dataset, which consists of 432K Flickr images. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective, achieving the following performance: Spearman's Rho: 0.7406, MSE: 2.7293, MAE: 1.2475.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Guangdong University of Technology", "Guangdong University of Technology", "Guangdong University of Technology", "Guangdong University of Technology", "Guangdong University of Technology"], "authors": ["Liuwu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Liuwu", "Runwei Situ.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Situ:Runwei", "Junyan Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Junyan", "Zhenguo Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhenguo", "Wenyin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wenyin"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
