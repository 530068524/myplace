{"title": "A Theory of Generative ConvNet.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "autoencoder", "rectifier", "multicategory", "piecewise"], "abstract": "We show that a generative random field model, which we call generative ConvNet, can be derived from the commonly used discriminative ConvNet, by assuming a ConvNet for multicategory classification and assuming one of the categories is a base category generated by a reference distribution. If we further assume that the non-linearity in the ConvNet is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the reference distribution is Gaussian white noise, then we obtain a generative ConvNet model that is unique among energy-based models: The model is piecewise Gaussian, and the means of the Gaussian pieces are defined by an auto-encoder, where the filters in the bottom-up encoding become the basis functions in the top-down decoding, and the binary activation variables detected by the filters in the bottom-up convolution process become the coefficients of the basis functions in the top-down deconvolution process. The Langevin dynamics for sampling the generative ConvNet is driven by the reconstruction error of this autoencoder. The contrastive divergence learning of the generative ConvNet reconstructs the training images by the auto-encoder. The maximum likelihood learning algorithm can synthesize realistic natural image patterns.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jianwen Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Jianwen", "Yang Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yang", "Song-Chun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Song=Chun", "Ying Nian Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ying_Nian"], "pages": 10}
