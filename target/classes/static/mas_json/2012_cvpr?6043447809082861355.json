However, there is a key issue to be solved on how to integrate the inaccurate scores of part detectors when there are occlusions or large deformations. To handle the imperfectness of part detectors, this paper presents a probabilistic pedestrian detection framework. In this framework, a deformable part-based model is used to obtain the scores of part detectors and the visibilities of parts are modeled as hidden variables. Unlike previous occlusion handling approaches that assume independence among visibility probabilities of parts or manually define rules for the visibility relationship, a discriminative deep model is used in this paper for learning the visibility relationship among overlapping parts at multiple layers. Experimental results on three public datasets (Caltech, ETH and Daimler) and a new CUHK occlusion dataset 1  specially designed for the evaluation of occlusion handling approaches show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (205)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wanli Ouyang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouyang:Wanli", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang"], "pages": 8}
