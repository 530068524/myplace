{"title": "Achieving new upper bounds for the hypergraph duality problem through logic.", "fields": ["conjecture", "hypergraph", "nondeterministic algorithm", "subclass", "complexity class", "p", "monotone polygon"], "abstract": "The hypergraph duality problem Dual is defined as follows: given two simple hypergraphs  G  and  H , decide whether  H  consists precisely of all minimal transversals of  G  (in which case we say that  G  is the dual of  H ). This problem is equivalent to decide whether two given non-redundant monotone DNFs are dual. It is known that DUAL, the complementary problem to Dual, is in GC (log 2   n , PTIME), where GC( f ( n ),  C ) denotes the complexity class of all problems that after a nondeterministic guess of  O ( f ( n )) bits can be decided (checked) within complexity class  C . It was conjectured that DUAL is in GC(log 2   n , LOGSPACE). In this paper we prove this conjecture and actually place the DUAL problem into the complexity class GC(log 2   n , TC 0 ) which is a subclass of GC(log 2   n , LOGSPACE). We here refer to the logtime-uniform version of TC 0 , which corresponds to FO(COUNT), i.e., first order logic augmented by counting quantifiers. We achieve the latter bound in two steps. First, based on existing problem decomposition methods, we develop a new nondeterministic algorithm for DUAL that requires to guess  O (log 2   n ) bits. We then proceed by a logical analysis of this algorithm, allowing us to formulate its deterministic part in FO(COUNT).", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "D.I.M.E.S., Uni ... nde (CS), Italy"], "authors": ["Georg Gottlob.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottlob:Georg", "Enrico Malizia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malizia:Enrico"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
