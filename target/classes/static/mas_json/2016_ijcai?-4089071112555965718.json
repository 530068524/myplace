{"title": "State-Dependent Cost Partitionings for Cartesian Abstractions in Classical Planning.", "fields": ["search algorithm", "heuristic", "abstraction", "cartesian coordinate system", "heuristics"], "abstract": "Abstraction heuristics are a popular method to guide optimal search algorithms in classical planning. Cost partitionings allow to sum heuristic estimates admissibly by distributing action costs among the heuristics. We introduce state-dependent cost partitionings which take context information of actions into account, and show that an optimal state-dependent cost partitioning dominates its state-independent counterpart. We demonstrate the potential of our idea with a state-dependent variant of the recently proposed saturated cost partitioning, and show that it has the potential to improve not only over its state-independent counterpart, but even over the optimal state-independent cost partitioning. Our empirical results give evidence that ignoring the context of actions in the computation of a cost partitioning leads to a significant loss of information.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Basel", "University of Basel", "University of Basel", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Thomas Keller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keller_0001:Thomas", "Florian Pommerening.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pommerening:Florian", "Jendrik Seipp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seipp:Jendrik", "Florian Gei\u00dfer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gei=szlig=er:Florian", "Robert Mattm\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mattm=uuml=ller:Robert"], "pages": 9}
