But word appears to be too fine-grained in some cases such as non-compositional phrasal equivalences, where no clear word alignments exist. Using words as inputs to PB-SMT pipeline has inborn deficiency. This paper proposes pseudo-word as a new start point for PB-SMT pipeline. Pseudo-word is a kind of basic multi-word expression that characterizes minimal sequence of consecutive words in sense of translation. By casting pseudo-word searching problem into a parsing framework, we search for pseudo-words in a monolingual way and a bilingual synchronous way. Experiments show that pseudo-word significantly outperforms word for PB-SMT model in both travel translation domain and news translation domain.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xiangyu Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Xiangyu", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Min", "Haizhou Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Haizhou"], "pages": 9}
