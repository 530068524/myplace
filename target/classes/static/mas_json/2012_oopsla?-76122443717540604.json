{"title": "Speculative analysis of integrated development environment recommendations.", "fields": ["rename", "collision", "development environment", "code refactoring", "source code"], "abstract": "Modern integrated development environments make recommendations and automate common tasks, such as refactorings, auto-completions, and error corrections. However, these tools present little or no information about the consequences of the recommended changes. For example, a rename refactoring may: modify the source code without changing program semantics; modify the source code and (incorrectly) change program semantics; modify the source code and (incorrectly) create compilation errors; show a name collision warning and require developer input; or show an error and not change the source code. Having to compute the consequences of a recommendation -- either mentally or by making source code changes -- puts an extra burden on the developers. This paper aims to reduce this burden with a technique that informs developers of the consequences of code transformations. Using Eclipse Quick Fix as a domain, we describe a plug-in, Quick Fix Scout, that computes the consequences of Quick Fix recommendations. In our experiments, developers completed compilation-error removal tasks 10% faster when using Quick Fix Scout than Quick Fix, although the sample size was not large enough to show statistical significance.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Waterloo", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Kivan\u00e7 Muslu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muslu:Kivan=ccedil=", "Yuriy Brun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brun:Yuriy", "Reid Holmes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holmes:Reid", "Michael D.
