{"title": "Decomposition instead of self-composition for proving the absence of timing channels.", "fields": ["java bytecode", "psychological resilience", "timing attack", "partition", "quotient"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach to proving the absence of timing channels. The idea is to partition the program\u00e2  s execution traces in such a way that each partition component is checked for timing attack resilience by a time complexity analysis and that per-component resilience implies the resilience of the whole program. We construct a partition by splitting the program traces at secret-independent branches. This ensures that any pair of traces with the same public input has a component containing both traces. Crucially, the per-component checks can be normal safety properties expressed in terms of a single execution. Our approach is thus in contrast to prior approaches, such as self-composition, that aim to reason about multiple ( k \u00e2 \ufffd 2) executions at once.   We formalize the above as an approach called quotient partitioning, generalized to any  k -safety property, and prove it to be sound. A key feature of our approach is a demand-driven partitioning strategy that uses a regex-like notion called trails to identify sets of execution traces, particularly those influenced by tainted (or secret) data. We have applied our technique in a prototype implementation tool called Blazer, based on WALA, PPL, and the brics automaton library. We have proved timing-channel freedom of (or synthesized an attack specification for) 24 programs written in Java bytecode, including 6 classic examples from the literature and 6 examples extracted from the DARPA STAC challenge problems.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Yale University", "JAIST, Japan"], "authors": ["Timos Antonopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antonopoulos:Timos", "Paul Gazzillo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gazzillo:Paul", "Michael Hicks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hicks_0001:Michael", "Eric Koskinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koskinen:Eric", "Tachio Terauchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terauchi:Tachio", "Shiyi Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Shiyi"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
