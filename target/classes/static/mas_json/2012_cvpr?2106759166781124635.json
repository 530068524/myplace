While existing algorithms usually use manually defined spatial regions for pooling, we show that learning more adaptive receptive fields increases performance even with a significantly smaller codebook size at the coding layer. To learn the optimal pooling parameters, we adopt the idea of over-completeness by starting with a large number of receptive field candidates, and train a classifier with structured sparsity to only use a sparse subset of all the features. An efficient algorithm based on incremental feature selection and retraining is proposed for fast learning. With this method, we achieve the best published performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, using a much lower dimensional feature space than previous methods.", "citation": "Citations (285)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "NEC Labs America"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yangqing Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Yangqing", "Chang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chang", "Trevor Darrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darrell:Trevor"], "pages": 8}
