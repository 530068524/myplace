We compare classifiers that include or exclude features for the counts of various N-grams, where the counts are obtained from a web-scale auxiliary corpus. We show that including N-gram count features can advance the state-of-the-art accuracy on standard data sets for adjective ordering, spelling correction, noun compound bracketing, and verb part-of-speech disambiguation. More importantly, when operating on new domains, or when labeled training data is not plentiful, we show that using web-scale N-gram features is essential for achieving robust performance.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Pennsylvania", "Google"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shane Bergsma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergsma:Shane", "Emily Pitler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitler:Emily", "Dekang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Dekang"], "pages": 10}
