{"title": "Learning Spatio-Temporal Structure from RGB-D Videos for Human Activity Detection and Anticipation.", "fields": ["anticipation", "rgb color model", "affordance", "ambiguity", "conditional random field"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of detecting past activities as well as anticipating which activity will happen in the future and how. We start by modeling the rich spatio-temporal relations between human poses and objects (called affordances) using a conditional random field (CRF). However, because of the ambiguity in the temporal segmentation of the sub-activities that constitute an activity, in the past as well as in the future, multiple graph structures are possible. In this paper, we reason about these alternate possibilities by reasoning over multiple possible graph structures. We obtain them by approximating the graph with only additive features, which lends to efficient dynamic programming. Starting with this proposal graph structure, we then design moves to obtain several other likely graph structures. We then show that our approach improves the state-of-the-art significantly for detecting past activities as well as for anticipating future activities, on a dataset of 120 activity videos collected from four subjects.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Hema Swetha Koppula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koppula:Hema_Swetha", "Ashutosh Saxena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saxena:Ashutosh"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
