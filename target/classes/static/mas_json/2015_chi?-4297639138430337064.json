{"title": "Lamello: Passive Acoustic Sensing for Tangible Input Components.", "fields": ["computer hardware", "audio analyzer", "audio signal processing", "tine", "computer science"], "abstract": "We describe Lamello, an approach for creating tangible input components that recognize user interaction via passive acoustic sensing. Lamello employs comb-like structures with varying-length tines at interaction points (e.g., along slider paths). Moving a component generates tine strikes; a real-time audio processing pipeline analyzes the resultant sounds and emits high-level interaction events. Our main contributions are in the co-design of the tine structures, information encoding schemes, and audio analysis. We demonstrate 3D printed Lamello-powered buttons, sliders, and dials.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Valkyrie Savage.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savage:Valkyrie", "Andrew Head.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Head:Andrew", "Bj\u00f6rn Hartmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartmann:Bj=ouml=rn", "Dan B.
