State-of-the-art methods for removing camera shake model the blur as a linear combination of homographically transformed versions of the true image. While this is conceptually interesting, the resulting algorithms are computationally demanding. In this paper we develop a forward model based on the efficient filter flow framework, incorporating the particularities of camera shake, and show how an efficient algorithm for blur removal can be obtained. Comprehensive comparisons on a number of real-world blurry images show that our approach is not only substantially faster, but it also leads to better deblurring results.", "citation": "Citations (213)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Michael Hirsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirsch_0001:Michael", "Christian J.
