The development of faster and widely deployed computers also had a great impact on cryptology, allowing modern cryptography to become a practical tool. Today, both computers and cryptology are not only prac- tical, but they have became ubiquitous tools. In truth, computing devices incorporating cryptography features range from very small low-end de- vices to supercomputer, going through all possible intermediate sizes; these devices include both general purpose computing devices and spe- cific, often embedded, processors which enable computing and security features in hundreds of technological objects. In this invited talk, we mostly consider the cryptanalytic side of things, where it is fair to use very large amounts of computing power to break cryptographic primitives or protocols. As a consequence, demon- strating the feasibility of new cryptanalytic methods often requires large scale computations. Most articles describing such cryptanalyses usually focus on the mathematical or algorithmic advances and gloss over the implementation details, giving only sufficient data to show that the com- putations are feasible. The goal of the present abstract is to give an idea of the difficulty facing implementers of large scale cryptanalytic attacks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'armement"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Antoine Joux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joux:Antoine"], "pages": 7}
