{"title": "Efficient Implementation of Many-Body Quantum Chemical Methods on the Intel\u00ae Xeon Phi Coprocessor.", "fields": ["coprocessor", "xeon", "hyper threading", "scalability", "xeon phi"], "abstract": "This paper presents the implementation and performance of the highly accurate CCSD(T) quantum chemistry method on the Intel \u00ae  Xeon Phi \u2122  coprocessor within the context of the NWChem computational chemistry package. The widespread use of highly correlated methods in electronic structure calculations is contingent upon the interplay between advances in theory and the possibility of utilizing the ever-growing computer power of emerging heterogeneous architectures. We discuss the design decisions of our implementation as well as the optimizations applied to the compute kernels and data transfers between host and coprocessor. We show the feasibility of adopting the Intel \u00ae  Many Integrated Core Architecture and the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor for developing efficient computational chemistry modeling tools. Remarkable scalability is demonstrated by benchmarks. Our solution scales up to a total of 62560 cores with the concurrent utilization of Intel \u00ae  Xeon \u00ae  processors and Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Intel", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Edoardo Apr\u00e0.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apr=agrave=:Edoardo", "Michael Klemm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klemm:Michael", "Karol Kowalski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kowalski:Karol"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
