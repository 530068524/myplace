{"title": "A decisions query language (DQL): high-level abstraction for mathematical programming over databases.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "query by example", "sargable", "data control language", "view"], "abstract": "The demonstrated, high-level decisions query language DQL combines the decision optimization capability of mathematical programming and the data manipulation capability of traditional database query languages. DQL benefits application developers in two aspects. First, it avoids a conceptual impedance mismatch between mathematical programming and data access and makes decision optimization functionality readily accessible to database programmers with no prior experience in operations research. Second, a tight integration provides unique opportunities for more efficient evaluation as compared to a loosely coupled system. This demonstration uses an emergency response scenario to illustrate the power of the language and its implementation.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["George Mason University", "George Mason University", "George Mason University", "George Mason University", "University of Vermont"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Alexander Brodsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brodsky_0001:Alexander", "Mayur M.
