However, graph data tends to be uncertain in practice due to noise, incompleteness and inaccuracy. This paper investigates the problem of finding top-k maximal cliques in an uncertain graph. A new model of uncertain graphs is presented, and an intuitive measure is introduced to evaluate the significance of vertex sets. An optimized branch-and-bound algorithm is developed to find top-k maximal cliques, which adopts efficient pruning rules, a new searching strategy and effective preprocessing methods. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is very efficient on real uncertain graphs, and the top-k maximal cliques are very useful for real applications, e.g. protein complex prediction.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Zhaonian Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou:Zhaonian", "Jianzhong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianzhong", "Hong Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Hong", "Shuo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shuo"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
