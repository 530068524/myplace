To overcome this challenge, we designed and evaluated a crowdsensing system that detects collapsed buildings using end-user smartphones as distributed sensors. We present our evaluation of smartphones' accuracy in inferring a building collapse by detecting falls onto solid surfaces, and estimating the false positive rate. Further sensors can present more detailed information about each potential collapse event. We conduct simulations to identify strategies for dealing with false-positive data under scenarios of varying population density. Potential building collapses can be determined with 95% accuracy given 10 connected devices within a 125m radius, increasing to 99.99% for 50 devices. End-user devices can proactively offer valuable help to emergency responders during earthquakes, potentially saving lives.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "Kyushu University", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Aku Visuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Visuri:Aku", "Zeyun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Zeyun", "Denzil Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Denzil", "Shin'ichi Konomi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konomi:Shin=ichi", "Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
