The proposed PLAM framework employs a privacy-preserving request aggregation protocol with k-Anonymity and l-Diversity properties while without involving a trusted anonymizer server to keep user preference privacy when querying location-based service (LBS), and integrates unlinkable pseudo-ID technique to achieve user identity privacy, location privacy. Moreover, the proposed PLAM framework also introduces the privacy- preserving and verifiable polynomial computation to keep LBS provider's functions private while preventing the provider from cheating in computation. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed PLAM framework can not only achieve desirable privacy requirements but also resist outside attacks on source authentication, data integrity and availability. In addition, exten- sive simulations are also conducted, and simulation results guide us on how to set proper thresholds for k-anonymity, l-diversity to make a tradeoff between the desirable user preference privacy level and the request delay in different scenarios.
