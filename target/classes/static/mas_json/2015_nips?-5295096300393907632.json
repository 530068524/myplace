Our goal is to design efficient algorithms that simultaneously achieve low error in total variation norm while guaranteeing Differential Privacy to the individuals of the population.\n\nWe describe a general approach that yields near sample-optimal and computationally efficient differentially private estimators for a wide range of well-studied and natural distribution families. Our theoretical results show that for a wide variety of structured distributions there exist private estimation algorithms that are nearly as efficient\u2014both in terms of sample size and running time\u2014as their non-private counterparts. We complement our theoretical guarantees with an experimental evaluation. Our experiments illustrate the speed and accuracy of our private estimators on both synthetic mixture models and a large public data set.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Google", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ilias Diakonikolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakonikolas:Ilias", "Moritz Hardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardt:Moritz", "Ludwig Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Ludwig"], "pages": 9}
