{"title": "Learning Sparse Penalties for Change-point Detection using Max Margin Interval Regression.", "fields": ["proximal gradient methods", "mathematical optimization", "machine learning", "pattern recognition", "change detection"], "abstract": "In segmentation models, the number of change-points is typically chosen using a penalized cost function. In this work, we propose to learn the penalty and its constants in databases of signals with weak change-point annotations. We propose a convex relaxation for the resulting interval regression problem, and solve it using accelerated proximal gradient methods. We show that this method achieves state-of-the-art change-point detection in a database of annotated DNA copy number profiles from neuroblastoma tumors.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Mines ParisTech", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Toby Hocking.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hocking:Toby", "Guillem Rigaill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rigaill:Guillem", "Jean-Philippe Vert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vert:Jean=Philippe", "Francis R.
