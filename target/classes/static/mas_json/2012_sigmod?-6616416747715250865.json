However, with the proliferation of rich attribute information available for objects in real-world graphs, how to leverage structural and attribute information for clustering attributed graphs becomes a new challenge. Most existing works take a distance-based approach. They proposed various distance measures to combine structural and attribute information. In this paper, we consider an alternative view and propose a model-based approach to attributed graph clustering. We develop a Bayesian probabilistic model for attributed graphs. The model provides a principled and natural framework for capturing both structural and attribute aspects of a graph, while avoiding the artificial design of a distance measure. Clustering with the proposed model can be transformed into a probabilistic inference problem, for which we devise an efficient variational algorithm. Experimental results on large real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-art distance-based attributed graph clustering method.", "citation": "Citations (183)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "National University of Singapore", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Nanyang Technological University", "Institute of Hi ... pore, Singapore"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Zhiqiang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zhiqiang", "Yiping Ke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ke:Yiping", "Yi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0006:Yi", "Hong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Hong", "James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James"], "pages": 12}
