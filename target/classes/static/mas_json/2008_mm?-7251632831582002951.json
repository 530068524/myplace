Our research concentrates on how to send refinements to quickly improve the quality. Two important factors are considered in choosing the sending order: the dependency among the data and the view point of the user. First, we develop an analytical model to investigate the effect of dependency when progressive meshes are transmitted over a lossy network. Second, we propose a receiver-driven protocol to streaming progressive meshes according to users' view-points in a scalable way. Third, to further improve the scalability, we discuss how to apply our receiver-driven protocol in a hybrid peer-to-peer streaming system.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Wei Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wei"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
