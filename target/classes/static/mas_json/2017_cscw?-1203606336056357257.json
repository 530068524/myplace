{"title": "Aspirational Design and Messy Democracy: Partisanship, Policy, and Hope in an Asian City.", "fields": ["computer supported cooperative work", "urban design", "social computing", "sociotechnical system", "urban computing"], "abstract": "Recent research in CSCW, urban informatics, and sociotechnical systems has proposed new framings and emphases of the city as a locus of research on computing and called for a heightened focus on the entanglements of social policy and design. Yet there are relatively few empirical investigations of actual policy-design entanglements in specific cities, and of those available, non-Western cities are underrepresented. We report an empirical study of the 2010 Taipei International Flora Expo (TIFE) as a case to explore these urban informatics/social computing issues. Specifically, we offer an empirically grounded analysis of design as a mechanism of public futuring and debates, which contributes to a better understanding of \"participatory urbanship\" [6]; and we do so focusing on a non-Western city, both to ensure a broader representation of urban ways of life and also to de-center Western experiences as the primary basis of urban informatics theory in CSCW.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Cincinnati", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "authors": ["Guo Freeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freeman:Guo", "Jeffrey Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Jeffrey", "Shaowen Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Shaowen"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
