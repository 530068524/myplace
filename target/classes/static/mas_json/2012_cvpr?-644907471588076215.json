{"title": "Randomized visual phrases for object search.", "fields": ["image retrieval", "phrase", "thresholding", "object detection", "spatial contextual awareness"], "abstract": "Accurate matching of local features plays an essential role in visual object search. Instead of matching individual features separately, using the spatial context, e.g., bundling a group of co-located features into a visual phrase, has shown to enable more discriminative matching. Despite previous work, it remains a challenging problem to extract appropriate spatial context for matching. We propose a randomized approach to deriving visual phrase, in the form of spatial random partition. By averaging the matching scores over multiple randomized visual phrases, our approach offers three benefits: 1) the aggregation of the matching scores over a collection of visual phrases of varying sizes and shapes provides robust local matching; 2) object localization is achieved by simple thresholding on the voting map, which is more efficient than subimage search; 3) our algorithm lends itself to easy parallelization and also allows a flexible trade-off between accuracy and speed by adjusting the number of partition times. Both theoretical studies and experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods validate the advantages of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yuning Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yuning", "Jingjing Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Jingjing", "Junsong Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Junsong"], "pages": 8}
