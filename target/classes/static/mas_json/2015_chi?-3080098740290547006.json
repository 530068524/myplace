Motivated by the increasing popularity of wearable computing, this paper investigates the accuracy with which pedometry can be achieved on a head-mounted device: something previous research has not investigated. A study with 16 subjects compares the accuracy of pedometry for walking and running with an inertial sensor located at the head, pocket and hand/arm. Our study did not detect a significant difference in step counting accuracy between sensor locations, which demonstrates the feasibility of pedometry-based apps for head-mounted displays.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Nevada, Reno", "Google", "University of Nevada, Reno"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ilias Apostolopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Apostolopoulos:Ilias", "Daniel S.
