We show that explicit bounded degree agreement expanders exist, based on Ramanujan complexes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Bar-Ilan University"], "authors": ["Irit Dinur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinur:Irit", "Tali Kaufman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufman:Tali"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
