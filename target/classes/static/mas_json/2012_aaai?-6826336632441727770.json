{"title": "A Hybrid Algorithm for Coalition Structure Generation.", "fields": ["machine learning", "dynamic programming", "hybrid algorithm", "artificial intelligence", "mechanism design"], "abstract": "The current state-of-the-art algorithm for optimal coalition structure generation is IDP-IP--an algorithm that combines IDP (a dynamic programming algorithm due to Rahwan and Jennings, 2008b) with IP (a tree-search algorithm due to Rahwan et al., 2009). In this paper we analyse IDP-IP, highlight its limitations, and then develop a new approach for combining IDP with IP that overcomes these limitations.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Warsaw", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Talal Rahwan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahwan:Talal", "Tomasz P.
