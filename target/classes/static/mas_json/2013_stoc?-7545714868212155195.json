Lattice triangulations have been studied extensively both as geometric objects in their own right and by virtue of applications in algebraic geometry. Our focus is on random triangulations in which a triangulation \u03c3 has weight \u03bb |\u03c3| , where \u03bb is a positive real parameter and |\u03c3| is the total length of the edges in \u03c3. Empirically, this model exhibits a \"phase transition\" at \u03bb=1 (corresponding to the uniform distribution): for \u03bb 1 very large regions of aligned edges appear. We substantiate this picture as follows. For \u03bb 1 we show that the mixing time is exponential. These are apparently the first rigorous quantitative results on spatial mixing properties and dynamics of random lattice triangulations.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "Universit\u00e0 degl ...  studi Roma Tre", "Universit\u00e0 degl ...  studi Roma Tre", "Department of M ... atical Sciences", "University of R ...
