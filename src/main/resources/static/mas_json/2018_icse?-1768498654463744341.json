This paper tackles this challenge by presenting  symbolic regular verification  (SRV) that offers  significant speedups  over the state-of-the-art. SRV is based on dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) and enabled by novel techniques for mitigating path explosion: (1) a regular property-oriented path slicing algorithm, and (2) a synergistic combination of property-oriented path slicing and guiding. Slicing prunes redundant paths, while guiding boosts the search for counterexamples. We have implemented SRV for Java and evaluated it on 15 real-world open-source Java programs (totaling 259K lines of code). Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SRV. Compared with the state-of-the-art --- pure DSE, pure guiding, and pure path slicing --- SRV achieves average speedups of more than 8.4X, 8.6X, and 7X, respectively, making symbolic regular property verification significantly more practical.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "National University of Defense Technology"], "authors": ["Hengbiao Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Hengbiao", "Zhenbang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhenbang", "Ji Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ji", "Zhendong Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Zhendong", "Wei Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong_0006:Wei"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
