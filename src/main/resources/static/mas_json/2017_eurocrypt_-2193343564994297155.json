Assuming the worst-case hardness of Ideal-SVP allows to prove the Ring-LWE and Ring-SIS assumptions, and therefore to prove the security of numerous cryptographic schemes and protocols \u2014 including key-exchange, digital signatures, public-key encryption and fully-homomorphic encryption.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Leiden University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Cryptology Group, CWI"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Ronald Cramer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cramer:Ronald", "L\u00e9o Ducas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ducas:L=eacute=o", "Benjamin Wesolowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wesolowski:Benjamin"], "pages": 25}
