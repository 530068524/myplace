Given a query Q, a graph G and a small ratio \u03b1, it aims to answer Q in G by accessing only a fraction G Q  of G of size |G Q | \u2264 \u03b1 |G|. The need for this is evident when G is big while our available resources are limited, as indicated by \u03b1. We propose resource-bounded query answering via a dynamic scheme that reduces big G to G Q . We investigate when we can find the exact answers Q(G) from G Q , and if G Q  cannot accommodate enough information, how accurate the approximate answers Q(G Q ) are. To verify the effectiveness of the approach, we study two types of queries. One consists of pattern queries that have data locality, such as subgraph isomorphism and strong simulation. The other is the class of reachability queries, without data locality. We show that it is hard to get resource-bounded algorithms with 100% accuracy: NP-hard for pattern queries, and non-existing for reachability when \u03b1 \u2260 1. Despite these, we develop resource-bounded algorithms for answering these queries. Using real-life and synthetic data, we experimentally evaluate the performance of the algorithms. We find that they scale well for both types of queries, and our approximate answers are accurate, even 100% for small \u03b1.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Southwest Jiaotong University", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "School of Informatics"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Wenfei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Wenfei", "Xin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xin", "Yinghui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yinghui"], "pages": 12}
