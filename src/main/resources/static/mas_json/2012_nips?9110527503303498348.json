We present dip-means, a novel robust incremental method to learn the number of data clusters that can be used as a wrapper around any iterative clustering algorithm of k-means family. In contrast to many popular methods which make assumptions about the underlying cluster distributions, dip-means only assumes a fundamental cluster property: each cluster to admit a unimodal distribution. The proposed algorithm considers each cluster member as an individual 'viewer' and applies a univariate statistic hypothesis test for unimodality (dip-test) on the distribution of distances between the viewer and the cluster members. Important advantages are: i) the unimodality test is applied on univariate distance vectors, ii) it can be directly applied with kernel-based methods, since only the pairwise distances are involved in the computations. Experimental results on artificial and real datasets indicate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over analogous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Ioannina", "University of Ioannina"], "authors": ["Argyris Kalogeratos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalogeratos:Argyris", "Aristidis Likas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Likas:Aristidis"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
