{"title": "Improving PAC Exploration Using the Median Of Means.", "fields": ["operator", "mathematical optimization", "bellman equation", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present the first application of the median of means in a PAC exploration algorithm for MDPs. Using the median of means allows us to significantly reduce the dependence of our bounds on the range of values that the value function can take, while introducing a dependence on the (potentially much smaller) variance of the Bellman operator. Additionally, our algorithm is the first algorithm with PAC bounds that can be applied to MDPs with unbounded rewards.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jason Pazis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pazis:Jason", "Ronald Parr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parr:Ronald", "Jonathan P.
