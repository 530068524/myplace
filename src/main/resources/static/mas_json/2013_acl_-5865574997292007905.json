{"title": "Punctuation Prediction with Transition-based Parsing.", "fields": ["parsing", "exploit", "punctuation", "test data", "text processing"], "abstract": "Punctuations are not available in automatic speech recognition outputs, which could create barriers to many subsequent text processing tasks. This paper proposes a novel method to predict punctuation symbols for the stream of words in transcribed speech texts. Our method jointly performs parsing and punctuation prediction by integrating a rich set of syntactic features when processing words from left to right. It can exploit a global view to capture long-range dependencies for punctuation prediction with linear complexity. The experimental results on the test data sets of IWSLT and TDT4 show that our method can achieve high-level performance in punctuation prediction over the stream of words in transcribed speech text.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Dongdong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dongdong", "Shuangzhi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Shuangzhi", "Nan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Nan", "Mu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mu"], "pages": 9}
