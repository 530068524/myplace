As the number of users of these sites continues to grow at an extraordinary rate, the amount of data produced follows in magnitude. With this deluge of social media data, the need for comprehensive tools to analyze user interactions is ever increasing. In this paper, we present a novel tool, Navigating Information Facets on Twitter (NIF-T), which helps users to explore data generated on social media sites. Using the three dimensions or facets: time, location, and topic as an example of the many possible facets, we enable the users to explore large social media datasets. With the help of a large corpus of tweets collected from the Occupy Wall Street movement on the Twitter platform we show how our system can be used to identify important aspects of the event along these facets.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Shamanth Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Shamanth", "Fred Morstatter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morstatter:Fred", "Grant Marshall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marshall:Grant", "Huan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Huan", "Ullas Nambiar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nambiar:Ullas"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
