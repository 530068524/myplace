It describes how to effectively bridge the gap between deep learning and the special needs of the pillar HPC problem through a set of techniques on matrix representations, deep learning structure, and cross-architecture model migrations. The new solution cuts format selection errors by two thirds, and improves SpMV performance by 1.73X on average over the state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Carl Albert State College", "North Carolina State University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Yue Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yue", "Jiajia Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiajia", "Chunhua Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Chunhua", "Xipeng Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xipeng"], "pages": 15}
