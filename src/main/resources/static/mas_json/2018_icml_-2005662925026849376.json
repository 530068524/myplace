Unlike previous approaches, our method extends to continuous input distributions and allows the support of the barycenter to be adjusted in each iteration. We tackle the problem without regularization, allowing us to recover a sharp output whose support is contained within the support of the true barycenter. We give examples where our algorithm recovers a more meaningful barycenter than previous work. Our method is versatile and can be extended to applications such as generating super samples from a given distribution and recovering blue noise approximations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sebastian Claici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Claici:Sebastian", "Edward Chien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chien:Edward", "Justin Solomon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solomon:Justin"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
