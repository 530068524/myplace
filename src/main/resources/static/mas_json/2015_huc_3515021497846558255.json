{"title": "From research to industry: interactive mobile services for accelerating logistics processes.", "fields": ["wearable computer", "simulation", "mobile computing", "mobile device", "mobile search"], "abstract": "Whenever attentiveness for direct human computer interaction is unavailable, i.e., when a person must not be distracted from performing a task or is handicapped through wearable limitations (e.g., by protective clothing), mobile location-based systems offer implicit, hands-free interaction mechanisms enabling users to trigger actions by the physical presence of an (authorized) traceable mobile device at a predefined location. This paper utilizes the basic idea of this well-proven interaction principle, presents its successful industrial application at Austria's largest car logistics company (Hodlmayr International) and demonstrates its potential savings for the logistics domain in the course of a perennial observation of production figures.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "H\u00f6dlmayr Intern ... rtberg, Austria", "H\u00f6dlmayr Intern ... rtberg, Austria"], "authors": ["Wolfgang Narzt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narzt:Wolfgang", "Gustav Pomberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pomberger:Gustav", "Otto Weichselbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weichselbaum:Otto", "Reinhard Draxler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Draxler:Reinhard", "Markus Welser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welser:Markus"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 5}
