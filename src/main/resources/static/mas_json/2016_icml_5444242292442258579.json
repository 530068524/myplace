{"title": "The Segmented iHMM: A Simple, Efficient Hierarchical Infinite HMM.", "fields": ["hidden markov model", "mathematical optimization", "inference", "pattern recognition", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We propose the segmented iHMM (siHMM), a hierarchical infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) that supports a simple, efficient inference scheme. The siHMM is well suited to segmentation problems, where the goal is to identify points at which a time series transitions from one relatively stable regime to a new regime. Conventional iHMMs often struggle with such problems, since they have no mechanism for distinguishing between high- and low-level dynamics. Hierarchical HMMs (HHMMs) can do better, but they require much more complex and expensive inference algorithms. The siHMM retains the simplicity and efficiency of the iHMM, but out-performs it on a variety of segmentation problems, achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of a more complicated HHMM.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Adobe Systems", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ardavan Saeedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saeedi:Ardavan", "Matthew D.
