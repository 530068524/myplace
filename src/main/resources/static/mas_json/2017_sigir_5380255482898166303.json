Presently, the mutual  k NN graph is the most preferred as it reduces  hub  nodes which can be a cause of failure during the process of label propagation. However, the mutual  k NN graph, which is usually very sparse, suffers from  over sparsification problem . That is, although the number of edges connecting nodes that have different labels decreases in the mutual  k NN graph, the number of edges connecting nodes that have the same labels also reduces. In addition, over sparsification can produce a disconnected graph, which is not desirable for label propagation. So we present a new graph construction method, the  centered kNN graph , which not only reduces hub nodes but also avoids the over sparsification problem.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Yamagata University", "National Institute of Genetics"], "authors": ["Ikumi Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Ikumi", "Kazuo Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hara:Kazuo"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
