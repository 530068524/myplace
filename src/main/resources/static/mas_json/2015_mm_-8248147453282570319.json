{"title": "EventBuilder: Real-time Multimedia Event Summarization by Visualizing Social Media.", "fields": ["social media", "metadata", "information retrieval", "multimedia", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "Due to the ubiquitous availability of smartphones and digital cameras, the number of photos/videos online has increased rapidly. Therefore, it is challenging to efficiently browse multimedia content and obtain a summary of an event from a large collection of photos/videos aggregated in social media sharing platforms such as Flickr and Instagram. To this end, this paper presents the EventBuilder system that enables people to automatically generate a summary for a given event in real-time by visualizing different social media such as Wikipedia and Flickr. EventBuilder has two novel characteristics: (i) leveraging Wikipedia as event background knowledge to obtain more contextual information about an input event, and (ii) visualizing an interesting event in real-time with a diverse set of social media activities. According to our initial experiments on the YFCC100M dataset from Flickr, the proposed algorithm efficiently summarizes knowledge structures based on the metadata of photos/videos and Wikipedia articles.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Delhi Technological University", "National Institute of Informatics", "Nanjing University", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Rajiv Ratn Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Rajiv_Ratn", "Anwar Dilawar Shaikh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shaikh:Anwar_Dilawar", "Yi Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Yi", "Wenjing Geng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geng:Wenjing", "Roger Zimmermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmermann:Roger", "Gangshan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Gangshan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
