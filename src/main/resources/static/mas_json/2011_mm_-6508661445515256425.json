Synchronization in TISA is complicated by (a) the multi-modal, bandwidth-savvy and timing-dependent media streaming over shared network resources, and (b) the delay-sensitive and interaction-critical nature of TISA in the real two-site and multi-site applications. This paper provides an outline of my thesis which includes four major contributions: (1) proposing a generalized layered framework for multi-stream synchronization sourced at one or multiple sites, (2) presenting an adaptive media packet scheduling scheme based on multi-stream timing correlations under Internet dynamics, (3) proposing a synchronized multicast topology based on diverse user interests, and (4) studying human subjective satisfactions to guide the system adaptation. This study is expected to output research results significant for next-generation systems, where timing-dependent media multi-modality is critical.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Zixia Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zixia"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
