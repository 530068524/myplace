We introduce a new dataset that provides annotation for sharing models of appearance and correlation across categories. We use it to learn part and category detectors. These serve as the visual basis for an integrated model of objects. We describe objects by the spatial arrangement of their attributes and the interactions between them. Using this model, our system can find animals and vehicles that it has not seen and infer attributes, such as function and pose. Our experiments demonstrate that we can more reliably locate and describe both familiar and unfamiliar objects, compared to a baseline that relies purely on basic category detectors.", "citation": "Citations (201)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ali Farhadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farhadi:Ali", "Ian Endres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Endres:Ian", "Derek Hoiem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoiem:Derek"], "pages": 8}
