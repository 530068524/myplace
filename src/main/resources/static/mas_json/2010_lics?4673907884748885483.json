We study the expressive power of synchronizations gathering more and more processes simultaneously. We demonstrate the non-existence of a uniform, fully distributed translation of Milner's CCS with synchronizations of $n+1$ processes into CCS with synchronizations of $n$ processes that retains a \"reasonable'' semantics. We then extend our study to CCS with symmetric synchronizations allowing a process to perform both inputs and outputs at the same time. We demonstrate that synchronizations containing more than three input/output items are encodable in those with three items, while there is an expressivity gap between three and two.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Dipt. di Sci. d ...
