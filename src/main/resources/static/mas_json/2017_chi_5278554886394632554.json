Research has shown that tailoring these systems can increase their efficacy. However, there is little knowledge on how game-based persuasive systems can be tailored to individuals of various personality traits. To advance research in this area, we conducted a large-scale study of 660 participants to investigate how different personalities respond to various persuasive strategies that are used in persuasive health games and gamified systems. Our results reveal that people's personality traits play a significant role in the perceived persuasiveness of different strategies. Conscientious people tend to be motivated by  goal setting, simulation, self-monitoring and feedback ; people who are more open to experience are more likely to be demotivated by  rewards, competition, comparison , and  cooperation . We contribute to the CHI community by offering design guidelines for tailoring persuasive games and gamified designs to a particular group of personalities.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Rita Orji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orji:Rita", "Lennart E.
