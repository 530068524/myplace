{"title": "Evaluation of super-voxel methods for early video processing.", "fields": ["data set", "voxel", "benchmark", "video processing", "graph"], "abstract": "Supervoxel segmentation has strong potential to be incorporated into early video analysis as superpixel segmentation has in image analysis. However, there are many plausible supervoxel methods and little understanding as to when and where each is most appropriate. Indeed, we are not aware of a single comparative study on supervoxel segmentation. To that end, we study five supervoxel algorithms in the context of what we consider to be a good supervoxel: namely, spatiotemporal uniformity, object/region boundary detection, region compression and parsimony. For the evaluation we propose a comprehensive suite of 3D volumetric quality metrics to measure these desirable supervoxel characteristics. We use three benchmark video data sets with a variety of content-types and varying amounts of human annotations. Our findings have led us to conclusive evidence that the hierarchical graph-based and segmentation by weighted aggregation methods perform best and almost equally-well on nearly all the metrics and are the methods of choice given our proposed assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (198)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chenliang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Chenliang", "Jason J.
