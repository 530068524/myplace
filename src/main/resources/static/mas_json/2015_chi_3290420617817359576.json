We describe the development and evaluation of LApp--an application for Google Glass to help people with Parkinson's (PwP) monitor their speech volume and cue themselves to speak louder when necessary. Our findings highlight enthusiasm for using the application both at home as a volume training tool and in public social settings as a situated cueing device. We contribute insights to the literature on how eyewear technologies can provide assistance to people with health conditions and offer insights for the design of future self-monitoring and management applications on Google Glass.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Roisin McNaney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McNaney:Roisin", "Ivan Poliakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poliakov:Ivan", "John Vines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vines:John", "Madeline Balaam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balaam:Madeline", "Pengfei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Pengfei", "Patrick Olivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivier:Patrick"], "pages": 4}
