Our approach builds on observing the precise manner in which the classical graphical model MLE \"breaks down\" under high-dimensional settings. Our estimator uses a carefully constructed, well-defined and closed-form backward map, and then performs thresholding operations to ensure the desired sparsity structure. We provide a rigorous statistical analysis that shows that surprisingly our simple class of estimators recovers the same asymptotic convergence rates as those of the l1-regularized MLEs that are much more difficult to compute. We corroborate this statistical performance, as well as significant computational advantages via simulations of both discrete and Gaussian graphical models.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Eunho Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Eunho", "Aurelie C.
