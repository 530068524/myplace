{"title": "Supporting operating system kernel data disambiguation using points-to analysis.", "fields": ["kernel method", "pointer", "sysfs", "tree kernel", "procfs"], "abstract": "Generic pointers scattered around operating system (OS) kernels make the kernel data layout ambiguous. This limits current kernel integrity checking research to covering a small fraction of kernel data. Hence, there is a great need to obtain an accurate kernel data definition that resolves generic pointer ambiguities, in order to formulate a set of constraints between structures to support precise integrity checking. In this paper, we present KDD, a new tool for systematically generating a sound kernel data definition for any C-based OS e.g. Windows and Linux, without any prior knowledge of the kernel data layout. KDD performs static points-to analysis on the kernel\u2019s source code to infer the appropriate candidate types for generic pointers. We implemented a prototype of KDD and evaluated it to prove its scalability and effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Amani S.
