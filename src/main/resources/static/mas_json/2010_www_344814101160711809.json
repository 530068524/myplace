{"title": "TWC data-gov corpus: incrementally generating linked government data from data.gov.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "open government", "directive", "social semantic web", "linked data"], "abstract": "The Open Government Directive is making US government data available via websites such as Data.gov for public access. In this paper, we present a Semantic Web based approach that incrementally generates Linked Government Data (LGD) for the US government. In focusing on the trade-off between high quality LGD generation (requiring non-trivial human expert input) and massive LGD generation (requiring low human processing cost), our work is highlighted by the following features: (i) supporting low-cost and extensible LGD publishing for massive government data; (ii) using Social Semantic Web (Web3.0) technologies to incrementally enhance published LGD via crowdsourcing, and (iii) facilitating mash-ups by declaratively reusing cross-dataset mappings which usually are hard-coded in applications.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "authors": ["Li Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding_0001:Li", "Dominic DiFranzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DiFranzo:Dominic", "Alvaro Graves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Graves:Alvaro", "James Michaelis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michaelis:James", "Xian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xian", "Deborah L.
