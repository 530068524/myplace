{"title": "Model-based Revision Operators for Terminologies in Description Logics.", "fields": ["operator", "belief revision", "non monotonic logic", "axiom", "description logic"], "abstract": "The problem of revising an ontology consistently is closely related to the problem of belief revision which has been widely discussed in the literature. Some syntax-based belief revision operators have been adapted to revise ontologies in Description Logics (DLs). However, these operators remove the whole axioms to resolve logical contradictions and thus are not fine-grained. In this paper, we propose three model-based revision operators to revise terminologies in DLs. We show that one of them is more rational than others by comparing their logical properties. Therefore, we focus on this revision operator. We also consider the problem of computing the result of revision by our operator with the help of the notion of concept forgetting. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of our revision operator.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Guilin Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Guilin", "Jianfeng Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Jianfeng"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 7}
