While most systems allow for partitioning at the relatively coarse grain of a single core, some systems also support multiprogrammed virtualization, whereby a system can be more finely partitioned through time-sharing, down to a percentage of a core being allotted to a virtual machine. When multiple virtual machines share a single core however, performance can suffer due to the displacement of microarchitectural state. We introduce cache restoration, a hardware-based prefetching mechanism initiated by the underlying virtualization software when a virtual machine is being scheduled on a core, prefetching its working set and warming its initial environment. Through cycle-accurate simulation of a POWER7 system, we show that when applied to its private per-core L3 last-level cache, the warm cache translates into 20% on average performance improvement for a mixture of workloads on a highly partitioned core, compared to a virtualized server without cache restoration.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["David Daly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daly:David", "Harold W.
