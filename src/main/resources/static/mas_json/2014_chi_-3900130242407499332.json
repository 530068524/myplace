However, studies on exergame controllers mostly focus on designing new controllers and exploring specific application domains without analyzing human factors, such as performance, comfort, and effort. In this paper, we examine the characteristics of a speed-based exergame controller that bear on human factors related to body movement and exercise. Users performed tasks such as changing and maintaining exercise speed for avatar control while their performance was measured. The exergame controller follows Fitts' law, but requires longer movement time than a gamepad and Wiimote. As well, resistance force and target speed affect performance. User experience data confirm that the comfort and mental effort are adequate as practical game controllers. The paper concludes with discussion on applying our findings to practical exergame design.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "York University", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Taiwoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Taiwoo", "Uichin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Uichin", "Scott MacKenzie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/MacKenzie:Scott", "Miri Moon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moon:Miri", "Inseok Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Inseok", "Junehwa Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Junehwa"], "pages": 10}
