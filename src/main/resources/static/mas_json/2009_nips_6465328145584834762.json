{"title": "Slow, Decorrelated Features for Pretraining Complex Cell-like Networks.", "fields": ["receptive field", "mnist database", "activation function", "complex cell", "sampling distribution"], "abstract": "We introduce a new type of neural network activation function based on recent physiological rate models for complex cells in visual area V1. A single-hidden-layer neural network of this kind of model achieves 1.50% error on MNIST. We also introduce an existing criterion for learning slow, decorrelated features as a pretraining strategy for image models. This pretraining strategy results in orientation-selective features, similar to the receptive fields of complex cells. With this pretraining, the same single-hidden-layer model achieves 1.34% error, even though the pretraining sample distribution is very different from the fine-tuning distribution. To implement this pretraining strategy, we derive a fast algorithm for online learning of decorrelated features such that each iteration of the algorithm runs in linear time with respect to the number of features.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["James Bergstra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bergstra:James", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua"], "pages": 9}
