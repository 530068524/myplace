{"title": "TASS: Timing Analyzer of Scenario-Based Specifications.", "fields": ["spectrum analyzer", "bounded function", "sequence diagram", "static timing analysis", "reachability"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present TASS which is a timing analyzer of scenario-based specifications. TASS accepts UML2.0 interaction models with general and expressive timing constraints and can be used for three kinds of timing analysis problems: the reachability analysis, the constraint conformance analysis, and the bounded delay analysis. The underlying technique of TASS is to reduce the timing analysis problems into linear programming problems.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Minxue Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Minxue", "Lei Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Lei", "Xuandong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xuandong"], "pages": 7}
