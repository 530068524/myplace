Despite their importance, to our best knowledge, large-scale analysis of CDN cache performance is lacking in prior literature. A CDN serves many content publishers simultaneously and thus has unique workload characteristics; it typically deals with extremely large content volume and high content diversity from multiple content publishers. CDNs also have unique performance metrics; other than hit ratio, CDNs also need to minimize network and disk load on cache servers. In this paper, we present measurement and analysis of caching workload at a large commercial CDN. Using detailed logs from four geographically distributed CDN cache servers, we analyze over 600 million content requests accounting for more than 1.3 petabytes worth of traffic. We analyze CDN workload from a wide range of perspectives, including request composition, size, popularity, and temporal dynamics. Using real-world logs, we also evaluate cache replacement algorithms, including two enhancements designed based on our CDN workload analysis: N-hit and content-aware caching. The results show that these enhancements achieve substantial performance gains in terms of cache hit ratio, disk load, and origin traffic volume.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Iowa", "Verizon Communications", "Michigan State University"], "authors": ["M.
