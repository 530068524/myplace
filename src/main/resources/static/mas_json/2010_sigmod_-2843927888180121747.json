In a parameterized query, the same SQL statement is potentially executed multiple times with different parameter values. In today's DBMSs the query optimizer typically chooses a single execution plan that is reused for multiple instances of the same query. A key problem is that even if a plan with low  average  cost across instances is chosen, its  variance  can be high, which is undesirable in many production settings. In this paper, we describe techniques for selecting a plan that can better address the trade-off between the average and variance of cost across instances of a parameterized query. We show how to efficiently compute the skyline in the average-variance cost space. We have implemented our techniques on top of a commercial DBMS. We present experimental results on benchmark and real-world decision support queries.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of British Columbia", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Surajit Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Surajit", "Hongrae Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hongrae", "Vivek R.
