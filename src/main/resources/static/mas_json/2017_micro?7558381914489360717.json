{"title": "SCRATCH: an end-to-end application-aware soft-GPGPU architecture and trimming tool.", "fields": ["instruction prefetch", "instruction set", "speedup", "intelligent decision support system", "legacy code"], "abstract": "Applying advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence algorithms is often constrained by power and energy consumption limitations, in high performance and embedded, cyber-physical and super-computing devices and systems. Although Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) helped to mitigate the throughput-per-Watt performance problem in many compute-intensive applications, dealing more efficiently with the autonomy requirements of intelligent systems demands power-oriented customized architectures that are specially tuned for each application, preferably without manual redesign of the entire hardware and capable of supporting legacy code. Hence, this work proposes a new SCRATCH framework that aims at automatically identifying the specific requirements of each application kernel, regarding instruction set and computing unit demands, allowing for the generation of application-specific and FPGA-implementable trimmed-down GPU-inspired architectures. The work is based on an improved version of the original MIAOW system (here named MIAOW2.0), which is herein extended to support a set of 156 instructions and enhanced to provide a fast prefetch memory system and a dual-clock domain. Experimental results with 17 highly relevant benchmarks, using integer and floating-point arithmetic, demonstrate that we have been able to achieve an average of 140\u00d7 speedup and 115\u00d7 higher energy-efficiency levels (instructions-per-Joule) when compared to the original MIAOW system, and a 2.4\u00d7 speedup and 2.1\u00d7 energy-efficiency gains compared against our optimized version without pruning.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Coimbra", "University of Lisbon", "University of Coimbra"], "authors": ["Pedro Duarte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duarte:Pedro", "Pedro Tom\u00e1s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tom=aacute=s:Pedro", "Gabriel Falc\u00e3o.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Falc=atilde=o:Gabriel"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
