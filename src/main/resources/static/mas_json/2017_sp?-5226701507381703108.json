{"title": "CoSMeDis: A Distributed Social Media Platform with Formally Verified Confidentiality Guarantees.", "fields": ["information flow", "social media", "hol", "proof assistant", "scala"], "abstract": "We present the design, implementation and information flow verification of CoSMeDis, a distributed social media platform. The system consists of an arbitrary number of communicating nodes, deployable at different locations over the Internet. Its registered users can post content and establish intra-node and inter-node friendships, used to regulate access control over the posts. The system's kernel has been verified in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL and automatically extracted as Scala code. We formalized a framework for composing a class of information flow security guarantees in a distributed system, applicable to input/output automata. We instantiated this framework to confidentiality properties for CoSMeDis's sources of information: posts, friendship requests, and friendship status.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Middlesex University", "Middlesex University", "German Res.
