Our lower bound technique allows us to derive further lower bounds for many-dimensional modal logics for which only elementary lower bounds were previously known. We also derive nonelementary lower bounds on the sizes of Feferman-Vaught decompositions w.r.t. product for any decomposable logic that is at least as expressive as unimodal K. Finally, we study the sizes of Feferman-Vaught decompositions and formulas in Gaifman normal form for fixed-variable fragments of first-order logic.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "Leipzig University", "Inst. fur Inf., ... eipzig, Germany"], "authors": ["Stefan G\u00f6ller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml=ller:Stefan", "Jean Christoph Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Jean_Christoph", "Markus Lohrey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lohrey:Markus"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
