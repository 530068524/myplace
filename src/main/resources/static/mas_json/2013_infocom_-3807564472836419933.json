In this paper, we propose a novel approach - Compressed Sparse Functions - to efficiently gather data through the use of highly sophisticated Compressive Sensing techniques. The idea of CSF is to gather a compressed version of a satisfying function (containing all the data) under a suitable function base, and to finally recover the original data. We show through theoretical analysis that our scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, while matching them in terms of accuracy. For example, in a binary tree-structured network of n nodes, our solution reduces the number of packets from the best-known O(kn log n) to O(k log 2  n), where k is a parameter depending on the correlation of the underlying sensor data. Finally, we provide simulations showing that our solution can save up to 80% of communication overhead in a 100-node network. Extensive simulations further show that our solution is robust, high-capacity and low-delay.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Liwen Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Liwen", "Xiao Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Xiao", "Yuexuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yuexuan", "Thomas Moscibroda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moscibroda:Thomas"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
