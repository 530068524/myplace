{"title": "Pushing relevant artifact annotations in collaborative software development.", "fields": ["software development", "collaborative software", "knowledge management", "javadoc", "information space"], "abstract": "Recent techniques show the benefits of attaching community generated knowledge to artifacts in an information space and presenting it to subsequent readers. We argue that such knowledge may also be relevant to the readers of artifacts which link to this target. Such situations are particularly frequent in software development, where a lack of awareness of critical directives associated with an invoked function can lead to costly errors. We describe how  eMoose , a group memory-aid for this domain, addresses these problems by visually \"pushing\" annotated knowledge from invocation targets into the invoking code. Similar techniques could potentially be applied to other development phases and to other domains.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Uri Dekel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dekel:Uri", "James D.
