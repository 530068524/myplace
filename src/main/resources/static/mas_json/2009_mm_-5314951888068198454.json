{"title": "On the impact of sequence and time in rich media advertising.", "fields": ["multimedia", "online advertising", "adaptive system", "computer science"], "abstract": "Nowadays, commercial websites use an increasing amount of rich media ads, since these ads grab users' attention more easily. Ad overloading has a counterproductive effect and we advocate a more parsimonious and finely-tuned use of ads. In this paper we stress the importance of using ads in the right sequence and at the right time. We also present how to use our web adaptation system for a classic web marketing multivariable test. The experimental results show the usefulness of optimizing banners' sequences and timing.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse"], "authors": ["Benoit Baccot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baccot:Benoit", "Omar Choudary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choudary:Omar", "Romulus Grigoras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grigoras:Romulus", "Vincent Charvillat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charvillat:Vincent"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
