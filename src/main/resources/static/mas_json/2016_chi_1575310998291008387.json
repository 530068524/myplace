{"title": "Motion Guidance Sleeve: Guiding the Forearm Rotation through External Artificial Muscles.", "fields": ["artificial muscle", "haptic technology", "rotation", "guidance system", "forearm"], "abstract": "Online fitness videos make it possible and popular to do exercise at home. However, it is not easy to notice the details of motions by merely watching training videos. We propose a new type of motion guidance system that simulates the way that the human body moves as driven by muscle contractions. We have designed external artificial muscles on a sleeve to create a pulling sensation that can guide the forearm's pronation (internal rotation) and the forearm's supination (external rotation). The sleeve consists of stepper motors to provide pulling force, fishing lines and elastic bands to imitate muscle contraction to drive the forearm to rotate instinctively. We present two preliminary experiments. The first one shows that this system can effectively guide the forearm to rotate in the correct direction. The second one shows that users can be guided to the targeted angle by utilizing a tactile cue. We also report users' feedback through the experiments and provide design recommendations and directions for future research.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["National Chengchi University", "National Chengchi University", "National Chengchi University", "National Chengchi University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chia-Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chia=Yu", "Yen-Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yen=Yu", "Yi-Ju Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Yi=Ju", "Neng-Hao Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Neng=Hao"], "pages": 5}
