Firstly, Convolution Neural Network(CNN) features are extracted to represent patches of a person. Secondly, only two positive patch-pairs are chosen and input into a Large Margin Nearest Neighbour(LMNN) network to learn two patch-based metric matrices for feature projection respectively. Thirdly, according to projected new features, a local salience learning algorithm based on Kmeans clustering is proposed to train the weights of patches. Finally, the similarity of image-pair is computed by a weighted summing of all patches. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing conventional approaches based on hand-crafted features and achieves a comparable performance with most recent CNN-based methods, which demonstrates our method\u2019s effectiveness and practicality. It does not need a large-scale labeled training dataset, and has a high matching rate with a low computation complexity.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"], "authors": ["Jiwei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jiwei", "Xu Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xu", "Xinmei Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Xinmei", "Houqiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Houqiang", "Jianqiang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jianqiang", "Xian-Sheng Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Xian=Sheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
