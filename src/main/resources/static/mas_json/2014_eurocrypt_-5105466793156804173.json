We describe a simplified variant of this compiler, and prove that it is a virtual black box obfuscator in a generic multilinear map model. This improves on Brakerski and Rothblum (eprint 2013) who gave such a result under a strengthening of the Exponential Time Hypothesis. We remove this assumption, and thus resolve an open question of Garg et al. As shown by Garg et al., a compiler for NC1 circuits can be bootstrapped to a compiler for all polynomial-sized circuits under the learning with errors (LWE) hardness assumption.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "IBM", "Microsoft", "Boston University", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Boaz Barak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barak:Boaz", "Sanjam Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Sanjam", "Yael Tauman Kalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalai:Yael_Tauman", "Omer Paneth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paneth:Omer", "Amit Sahai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahai:Amit"], "pages": 18}
