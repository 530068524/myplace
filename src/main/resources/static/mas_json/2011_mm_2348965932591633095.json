In this paper, we formulate CVPs discovery as a graph matching problem, depending on pairwise geometric compatibility between feature correspondences. To efficiently find all CVPs, we propose two algorithms--Preliminary Initialization Optimization (PIO) and Post Agglomerative Combining (PAC). PIO reduces the search space of CVPs discovery based on the internal homogeneity of CVPs, while PAC refines the discovery result in an agglomerative way. Experiments on object recognition and near-duplicate image re-trieval validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine"], "authors": ["Hongtao Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Hongtao", "Ke Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Ke", "Yongdong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yongdong", "Jintao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jintao", "Huamin Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Huamin"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
