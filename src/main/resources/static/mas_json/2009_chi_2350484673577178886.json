However, the use of aesthetics and critical theory in HCI remains both marginal and uneven in quality. This paper explores the state of the art of aesthetics and critical theory in the field, before going on to explore the role of these cultural theories in the analysis and deployment of the twin anchors of interaction: the user and the artifact. In concludes with a proposed mapping of aesthetics and criti-cal theory into interaction design, both as a practice and as a discipline.", "citation": "Citations (151)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jeffrey Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Jeffrey"], "pages": 10}
