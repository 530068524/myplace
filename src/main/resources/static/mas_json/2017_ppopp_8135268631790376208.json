{"title": "Checking Concurrent Data Structures Under the C/C++11 Memory Model.", "fields": ["concurrent data structure", "correctness", "parallel computing", "memory model", "compare and swap"], "abstract": "Concurrent data structures often provide better performance on multi-core processors but are significantly more difficult to design and test than their sequential counterparts. The C/C++11 standard introduced a weak memory model with support for low-level atomic operations such as compare and swap (CAS). While low-level atomic operations can significantly improve the performance of concurrent data structures, they introduce non-intuitive behaviors that can increase the difficulty of developing code.   In this paper, we develop a correctness model for concurrent data structures that make use of atomic operations. Based on this correctness model, we present CDSSPEC, a specification checker for concurrent data structures under the C/C++11 memory model. We have evaluated CDSSPEC on 10 concurrent data structures, among which CDSSPEC detected 3 known bugs and 93% of the injected bugs.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Peizhao Ou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ou:Peizhao", "Brian Demsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demsky:Brian"], "pages": 15}
