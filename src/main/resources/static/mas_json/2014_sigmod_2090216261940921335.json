{"title": "Explainable security for relational databases.", "fields": ["database security", "issuer", "computer security model", "sql", "security through obscurity"], "abstract": "Companies and organizations collect and use vast troves of sensitive user data whose release must be carefully controlled. In practice, the access policies that govern this data are often fine-grained, complex, poorly documented, and difficult to reason about. As a result, principals frequently request and are granted access to data they never use. To encourage developers and administrators to use security mechanisms more effectively, we propose a novel security model in which all security decisions are formally explainable. Whether a query is accepted or denied, the system returns a concise yet formal explanation which can allow the issuer to reformulate a rejected query or adjust his/her security credentials. Our approach has a strong formal foundation based on previously unexplored connections between disclosure lattices and policy algebras. We build on this foundation and implement a disclosure control system that handles a wide variety of real SQL queries and can accommodate complex policy constraints.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Gabriel Bender.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bender:Gabriel", "Lucja Kot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kot:Lucja", "Johannes Gehrke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehrke:Johannes"], "pages": 12}
