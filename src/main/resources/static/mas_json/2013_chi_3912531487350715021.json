{"title": "Improving touch accuracy on large tabletops using predecessor and successor.", "fields": ["successor cardinal", "human computer interaction", "yaw", "simulation", "offset"], "abstract": "Touch interfaces provide great flexibility in designing an UI. However, the actual experience is often frustrating due to bad touch recognition. On small systems, we can analyze yaw, roll, and pitch of the finger to increase touch accuracy for a single touch. On larger systems, we need to take additional factors into account as users have more flexibility for their limb posture and need to aim over larger distances. Thus, we investigated how people perform touch sequences on those large touch surfaces. We show that the relative location of the  predecessor  of a touch has a significant impact on the orientation and position of the touch ellipsis.   We exploited this effect on an off-the-shelf touch display and showed that with only minimal preparation the touch accuracy of standard hardware can be improved by at least 7%, allowing better recognition rates or more UI components on the same screen.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Max M\u00f6llers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=ouml=llers:Max", "Norbert Dumont.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dumont:Norbert", "Stefan Ladwig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ladwig:Stefan", "Jan O.
