Like most numerical methods, they return point estimates. We construct a family of probabilistic numerical methods that instead return a Gauss-Markov process defining a probability distribution over the ODE solution. In contrast to prior work, we construct this family such that posterior means match the outputs of the Runge-Kutta family exactly, thus inheriting their proven good properties. Remaining degrees of freedom not identified by the match to Runge-Kutta are chosen such that the posterior probability measure fits the observed structure of the ODE. Our results shed light on the structure of Runge-Kutta solvers from a new direction, provide a richer, probabilistic output, have low computational cost, and raise new research questions.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "University of Cambridge", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Michael Schober.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schober:Michael", "David K.
