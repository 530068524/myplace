We propose a methodology for developing such systems in a way that guarantees the \"maximal\" use of each feature. The methodology is based on the notion of \"conflict-tolerant\" features that are designed to continue offering advice even when their advice has been overridden in the past. We give a simple priority-based composition scheme for such features, which ensures that each feature is maximally utilized. We also provide a formal framework for specifying, verifying, and synthesizing such features. In particular we obtain a compositional technique for verifying systems developed in this framework.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Deepak D'Souza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=Souza:Deepak", "Madhu Gopinathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopinathan:Madhu"], "pages": 13}
