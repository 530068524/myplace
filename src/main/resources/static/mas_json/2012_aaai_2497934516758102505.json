Performing comprehensive searches of long-term memory in every situation can be computationally expensive and disruptive to task reasoning. In this paper, we demonstrate that the recognition judgment-a heuristic for whether memory structures have been previously perceived - can serve as a low-cost indicator of the existence of potentially relevant knowledge.We present an approach for computing both context-dependent and context-independent recognition judgments using processes and data shared with declarative memories. We then describe an initial, efficient implementation in the Soar cognitive architecture and evaluate our system in a word sense disambiguation task, showing that it reduces the number of memory searches without degrading agent performance.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Justin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Justin", "Nate Derbinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Derbinsky:Nate", "John E.
