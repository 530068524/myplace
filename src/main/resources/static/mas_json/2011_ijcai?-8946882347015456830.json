In general, the problem is \u03a32p-complete under Turing reductions, but restricted versions are tractable. We study the complexity of minimization for formulas in two established frameworks for restricted propositional logic: The Post framework allowing arbitrarily nested formulas over a set of Boolean connectors, and the constraint setting, allowing generalizations of CNF formulas. In the Post case, we obtain a dichotomy result: Minimization is solvable in polynomial time or coNP-hard. This result also applies to Boolean circuits. For CNF formulas, we obtain new minimization algorithms for a large class of formulas, and give strong evidence that we have covered all polynomial-time cases.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Rochester Institute of Technology", "University of Kiel"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Edith Hemaspaandra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hemaspaandra:Edith", "Henning Schnoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schnoor:Henning"], "pages": 6}
