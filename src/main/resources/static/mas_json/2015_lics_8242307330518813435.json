{"title": "PDL Is the Bisimulation-Invariant Fragment of Weak Chain Logic.", "fields": ["zeroth order logic", "intermediate logic", "autoepistemic logic", "substructural logic", "predicate functor logic"], "abstract": "We introduce a new class of parity automata which, on trees, captures the expressive power of weak chain logic. This logic is a variant of monadic second-order logic which quantifies over finite chains. Using this new tool, we show that the bisimulation-invariant fragment of weak chain logic is equivalent to propositional dynamic logic.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam"], "authors": ["Facundo Carreiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carreiro:Facundo"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
