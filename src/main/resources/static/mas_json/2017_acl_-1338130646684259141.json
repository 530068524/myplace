{"title": "A Neural Local Coherence Model.", "fields": ["grid", "pairwise comparison", "coherence", "convolutional neural network", "ranking"], "abstract": "We propose a local coherence model based on a convolutional neural network that operates over the entity grid representation of a text. The model captures long range entity transitions along with entity-specific features without loosing generalization, thanks to the power of distributed representation. We present a pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a task and learn task-specific high level features. Our evaluation on three different coherence assessment tasks demonstrates that our model achieves state of the art results outperforming existing models by a good margin.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Foundation"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Dat Tien Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Dat_Tien", "Shafiq Rayhan Joty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joty:Shafiq_Rayhan"], "pages": 11}
