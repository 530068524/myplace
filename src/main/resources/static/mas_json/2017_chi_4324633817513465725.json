{"title": "Embedding a Crowd inside a Relay Baton: A Case Study in a Non-Competitive Sporting Activity.", "fields": ["exploratory research", "haptic technology", "digital protective relay", "software deployment", "relay"], "abstract": "This paper presents a digital relay baton that connects long-distance runners with distributed online spectators. The baton broadcasts athletes? live locative data to a social network and communicates back remote-crowd support through haptic and audible cheers. Our work takes an exploratory design approach to bring new insights into the design of real-time techno-mediated social support. The prototype was deployed during a 170-mile charity relay race across the UK with 13 participants, 261 on-line supporters, and gathered a total of 3,153 'cheers'. We report on the insights collected during the design and deployment process and identify three fundamental design considerations: the degree of spectator expression that the design affords, the context applicability, and the data flow within the social network.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Franco Curmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curmi:Franco", "Maria Angela Ferrario.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferrario:Maria_Angela", "Jon Whittle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whittle:Jon"], "pages": 12}
