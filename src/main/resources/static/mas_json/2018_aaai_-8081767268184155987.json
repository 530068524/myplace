In this paper, we use binary generative adversarial networks (BGAN) to embed images to binary codes in an unsupervised way. By restricting the input noise variable of generative adversarial networks (GAN) to be binary and conditioned on the features of each input image, BGAN can simultaneously learn a binary representation per image, and generate an image plausibly similar to the original one. In the proposed framework, we address two main problems: 1) how to directly generate binary codes without relaxation? 2) how to equip the binary representation with the ability of accurate image retrieval? We resolve these problems by proposing new sign-activation strategy and a loss function steering the learning process, which consists of new models for adversarial loss, a content loss, and a neighborhood structure loss. Experimental results on standard datasets (CIFAR-10, NUSWIDE, and Flickr) demonstrate that our BGAN significantly outperforms existing hashing methods by up to 107\\% in terms of~mAP (See Table tab.res.map.comp) Our anonymous code is available at: this https URL", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Columbia University", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Jingkuan Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Jingkuan", "Tao He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Tao", "Lianli Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Lianli", "Xing Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Xing", "Alan Hanjalic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanjalic:Alan", "Heng Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Heng_Tao"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
