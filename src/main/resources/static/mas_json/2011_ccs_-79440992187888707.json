On the other hand, optimized protocols with high performance for special problems demand manual development and security verification. The question considered in this paper is: Can we construct a compiler that produces optimized protocols? We present an optimization technique based on logic inference about what is known from input and output. Using the example of median computation we can show that our program analysis and rewriting technique translates a FairPlay program into an equivalent -- in functionality and security -- program that corresponds to the protocol by Aggarwal et al. Nevertheless our technique is general and can be applied to optimize a wide variety of secure computation protocols.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["SAP Research, K ... lsruhe, Germany"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Florian Kerschbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kerschbaum:Florian"], "pages": 12}
