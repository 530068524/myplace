All previous lower bounds for this problem were designed for non-adaptive algorithms and, as a result, the best previous lower bound for general (possibly adaptive) monotonicity testers was only \u03a9(log n ). Combined with the query complexity of the non-adaptive monotonicity tester of Khot, Minzer, and Safra (FOCS 2015), our lower bound shows that adaptivity can result in at most a quadratic reduction in the query complexity for testing monotonicity.   By contrast, we show that there is an exponential gap between the query complexity of adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms for testing regular linear threshold functions (LTFs) for monotonicity. Chen, De, Servedio, and Tan (STOC 2015)recently showed that non-adaptive algorithms require almost \u03a9( n  1/2 ) queries for this task. We introduce a new adaptive monotonicity testing algorithm which has query complexity  O (log n ) when the input is a regular LTF.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "CWI, Netherlands"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Aleksandrs Belovs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belovs:Aleksandrs", "Eric Blais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blais:Eric"], "pages": 12}
