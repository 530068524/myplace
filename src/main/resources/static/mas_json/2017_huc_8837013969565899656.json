Smart Eye Mask has 19 photo-reflectors and measures the change in eye movement from the distance between the eyelid and the device. Since Smart Eye Mask is integrated into an eye mask, users do not feel uncomfortable during sleep. Moreover, users can utilize it anywhere because eye masks are easy to carry. We conducted an evaluation of Smart Eye Mask, and the recognition rate of classifying sleep stages as REM or NREM was 80.0 %.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Kobe University", "Kobe University", "Kobe University"], "authors": ["Shun Matsui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsui:Shun", "Tsutomu Terada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terada:Tsutomu", "Masahiko Tsukamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsukamoto:Masahiko"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
