Specifically, for every fixed finite field F q ,  p  \u2208 (0,1 - 1/ q ) and e >; 0, it is proved that with high probability a random linear code  C  in F q  n  of rate (1- H  q ( p )-e) can be list decoded from a fraction  p  of errors with lists of size at most  O (1/e). This also answers a basic open question concerning the existence of highly list-decodable linear codes, showing that a list-size of O(1/e) suffices to have rate within e of the information-theoretically optimal rate of 1 - H q (p). The best previously known list-size bound was q O(1/e)  (except in the q = 2 case where a list-size bound of O(1/e) was known). The main technical ingredient in the proof is a strong upper bound on the probability that I random vectors chosen from a Hamming ball centered at the origin have too many (more than \u03a9(l)) vectors from their linear span also belong to the ball.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Royal Institute of Technology", "Institute for Advanced Study"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Venkatesan Guruswami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guruswami:Venkatesan", "Johan H\u00e5stad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=aring=stad:Johan", "Swastik Kopparty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopparty:Swastik"], "pages": 8}
