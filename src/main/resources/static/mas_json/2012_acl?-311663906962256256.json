This paper proposes a methodological approach to temporally anchored relation extraction. Our proposal performs distant supervised learning to extract a set of relations from a natural language corpus, and anchors each of them to an interval of temporal validity, aggregating evidence from documents supporting the relation. We use a rich graph-based document-level representation to generate novel features for this task. Results show that our implementation for temporal anchoring is able to achieve a 69% of the upper bound performance imposed by the relation extraction step. Compared to the state of the art, the overall system achieves the highest precision reported.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["National University of Distance Education", "National University of Distance Education", "National University of Distance Education", "National University of Distance Education"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Guillermo Garrido.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garrido:Guillermo", "Anselmo Pe\u00f1as.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pe=ntilde=as:Anselmo", "Bernardo Cabaleiro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cabaleiro:Bernardo", "\u00c1lvaro Rodrigo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodrigo:=Aacute=lvaro"], "pages": 10}
