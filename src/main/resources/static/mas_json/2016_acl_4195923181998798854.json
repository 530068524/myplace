We describe two models that account for individual variation in the choice of referential form in automatically generated text: a Naive Bayes model and a Recurrent Neural Network. Both are evaluated using the VaREG corpus. Then we select the best performing model to generate referential forms in texts from the GREC-2.0 corpus and conduct an evaluation experiment in which humans judge the coherence and comprehensibility of the generated texts, comparing them both with the original references and those produced by a random baseline model.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "Tilburg University", "Tilburg University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Thiago Castro Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Thiago_Castro", "Emiel Krahmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krahmer:Emiel", "Sander Wubben.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wubben:Sander"], "pages": -1}
