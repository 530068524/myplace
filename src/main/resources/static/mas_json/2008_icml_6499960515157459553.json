For discriminative models however, this is a challenging task. In this contribution, we introduce an original methodology for using unlabeled data through the design of a simple semi-supervised objective function. We prove that the corresponding semi-supervised estimator is asymptotically optimal. The practical consequences of this result are discussed for the case of the logistic regression model.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech", "University of Paris-Sud"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Nataliya Sokolovska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sokolovska:Nataliya", "Olivier Capp\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capp=eacute=:Olivier", "Fran\u00e7ois Yvon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yvon:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 8}
