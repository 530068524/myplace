However, in practice, goals and use cases are often buried among other content in requirements specifications documents and written in unstructured styles. It is thus a time-consuming and error-prone process to identify such goals and use cases. In addition, having them embedded in natural language documents greatly limits the possibility of formally analyzing the requirements for problems. To address these issues, we have developed a novel rule-based approach to automatically extract goal and use case models from natural language requirements documents. Our approach is able to automatically categorize goals and ensure they are properly specified. We also provide automated semantic parameterization of artifact textual specifications to promote further analysis on the extracted goal-use case models. Our approach achieves 85% precision and 82% recall rates on average for model extraction and 88% accuracy for the automated parameterization.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology"], "authors": ["Tuong Huan Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Tuong_Huan", "John C.
