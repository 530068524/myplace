{"title": "CAN: Enhancing Sentence Similarity Modeling with Collaborative and Adversarial Network.", "fields": ["sentence", "extractor", "paraphrase", "discriminator", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "The neural networks have attracted great attention for sentence similarity modeling in recent years. Most neural networks focus on the representation of each sentence, while the common features of a sentence pair are not well studied. In this paper, we propose a Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which explicitly models the common features between two sentences for enhancing sentence similarity modeling. To be specific, a common feature extractor is presented and embedded into our CAN model, which includes a generator and a discriminator playing a collaborative and adversarial game for common feature extraction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely TREC-QA and WikiQA for answer selection and MSRP for paraphrase identification, show that our proposed model is effective to boost the performance of sentence similarity modeling. In particular, our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on TREC-QA without using any external resources or pre-training. For the other two datasets, our model is also comparable to if not better than the recent neural network approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "York University", "East China Normal University"], "authors": ["Qin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qin", "Qinmin Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Qinmin", "Jimmy Xiangji Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jimmy_Xiangji", "Liang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Liang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
