{"title": "Multi-representational security analysis.", "fields": ["security analysis", "security testing", "computer security model", "security information and event management", "exploit"], "abstract": "Security attacks often exploit flaws that are not anticipated in an abstract design, but are introduced inadvertently when high-level interactions in the design are mapped to low-level behaviors in the supporting platform. This paper proposes a  multi-representational  approach to security analysis, where models capturing distinct (but possibly overlapping) views of a system are automatically composed in order to enable an end-to-end analysis. This approach allows the designer to incrementally explore the impact of design decisions on security, and discover attacks that span multiple layers of the system. This paper describes Poirot, a prototype implementation of the approach, and reports on our experience on applying Poirot to detect previously unknown security flaws in publicly deployed systems.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Eunsuk Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Eunsuk", "Aleksandar Milicevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milicevic:Aleksandar", "Daniel Jackson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jackson_0001:Daniel"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
