Eleven patients with Parkinson's disease who had under-gone deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery were observed during follow-up appointments for adjustments to the stimulation settings. We examine the ways in which the patients and clinicians assess movement ability together in the clinic and how these assessments relate to the treatment of functional disability through DBS. We have found that effective assessment of movement and treatment efficacy is a collaborative and interpretive process (co-interpretation) that relies on input from patients, clinicians, and caregivers. From these findings we describe the design directions for movement sensors to support co-interpretation of movement in a clinical context as opposed to simply movement definition.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "University of Maryland, Baltimore", "University of Maryland, Baltimore", "University of Maryland, Baltimore"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Helena M.
