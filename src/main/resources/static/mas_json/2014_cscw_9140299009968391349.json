The information users share about one another can have significant impacts on impression formation, and at times this other-generated content may be face threatening, or challenging to one's desired self-presentation. However, we know little about the nature of these other-generated face threats and the ways that people perceive them. Using an online survey of 150 Facebook users, we report on what these users consider to be other-generated face threats and how they feel after experiencing them. Results suggest that many face threats result from other Facebook users neglecting or misunderstanding a target's audience and/or self-presentation goals, as well as a target's fear of creating an unwanted association with another Facebook user. Experience of these threats is affected by both individual and situational factors. We also report on a new unique measure capturing Facebook skills.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Cornell University", "Northwestern University", "Cornell University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Eden Litt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Litt:Eden", "Erin L.
