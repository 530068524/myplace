{"title": "Stream warehousing with DataDepot.", "fields": ["transaction log", "temporal database", "data stream management system", "data stream mining", "materialized view"], "abstract": "We describe DataDepot, a tool for generating warehouses from streaming data feeds, such as network-traffic traces, router alerts, financial tickers, transaction logs, and so on. DataDepot is a streaming data warehouse designed to automate the ingestion of streaming data from a wide variety of sources and to maintain complex materialized views over these sources. As a streaming warehouse, DataDepot is similar to Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) with its emphasis on temporal data, best-effort consistency, and real-time response. However, as a data warehouse, DataDepot is designed to store tens to hundreds of terabytes of historical data, allow time windows measured in years or decades, and allow both real-time queries on recent data and deep analyses on historical data. In this paper we discuss the DataDepot architecture, with an emphasis on several of its novel and critical features. DataDepot is currently being used for five very large warehousing projects within ATT one of these warehouses ingests 500 Mbytes per minute (and is growing). We use these installations to illustrate streaming warehouse use and behavior, and design choices made in developing DataDepot. We conclude with a discussion of DataDepot applications and the efficacy of some optimizations.", "citation": "Citations (137)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Lukasz Golab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golab:Lukasz", "Theodore Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Theodore", "J.
