{"title": "User Boresighting for AR Calibration: A Preliminary Analysis.", "fields": ["weibull distribution", "balance", "line of sight", "magnitude", "augmented reality"], "abstract": "The precision with which users can maintain boresight alignment between visual targets at different depths is recorded for 24 subjects using two different boresight targets. Subjects' normal head stability is established using their Romberg coefficients. Weibull distributions are used to describe the probabilities of the magnitude of head positional errors and the three dimensional cloud of errors is displayed by orthogonal two dimensional density plots. These data will lead to an understanding of the limits of user introduced calibration error in augmented reality systems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Link\u00f6ping University", "Link\u00f6ping University", "Ames Research Center"], "authors": ["Magnus Axholt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Axholt:Magnus", "Stephen Peterson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peterson:Stephen", "Stephen R.
