{"title": "Expanding Domain Sentiment Lexicon through Double Propagation.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "lexicon", "natural language processing", "artificial intelligence", "sentence"], "abstract": "In most sentiment analysis applications, the sentiment lexicon plays a key role. However, it is hard, if not impossible, to collect and maintain a universal sentiment lexicon for all application domains because different words may be used in different domains. The main existing technique extracts such sentiment words from a large domain corpus based on different conjunctions and the idea of sentiment coherency in a sentence. In this paper, we propose a novel propagation approach that exploits the relations between sentiment words and topics or product features that the sentiment words modify, and also sentiment words and product features themselves to extract new sentiment words. As the method propagates information through both sentiment words and features, we call it double propagation. The extraction rules are designed based on relations described in dependency trees. A new method is also proposed to assign polarities to newly discovered sentiment words in a domain. Experimental results show that our approach is able to extract a large number of new sentiment words. The polarity assignment method is also effective.", "citation": "Citations (434)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Guang Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Guang", "Bing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Bing", "Jiajun Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Jiajun", "Chun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chun"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
