We argue that a disproportionate focus on ranking competition participants has led to lots of different rankings, but little insight about which rankings we should trust. In response, we provide the first framework that allows an empirical comparison of different analyses of competition results. We then use this framework to compare several analytical models on data from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT).", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Information Sciences Institute"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mark Hopkins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hopkins:Mark", "Jonathan May.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/May:Jonathan"], "pages": 9}
