{"title": "Expectation Optimization with Probabilistic Guarantees in POMDPs with Discounted-Sum Objectives.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "drawback", "stochastic game", "markov decision process", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with discounted-sum payoff are a standard framework to model a wide range of problems related to decision making under uncertainty. Traditionally, the goal has been to obtain policies that optimize the expectation of the discounted-sum payoff. A key drawback of the expectation measure is that even low probability events with extreme payoff can significantly affect the expectation, and thus the obtained policies are not necessarily risk-averse. An alternate approach is to optimize the probability that the payoff is above a certain threshold, which allows obtaining risk-averse policies, but ignores optimization of the expectation. We consider the expectation optimization with probabilistic guarantee (EOPG) problem, where the goal is to optimize the expectation ensuring that the payoff is above a given threshold with at least a specified probability. We present several results on the EOPG problem, including the first algorithm to solve it.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Adri\u00e1n Elgy\u00fctt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elgy=uuml=tt:Adri=aacute=n", "Petr Novotn\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Novotn=yacute=_0001:Petr", "Owen Rouill\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rouill=eacute=:Owen"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
