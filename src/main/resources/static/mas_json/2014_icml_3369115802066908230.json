We reduce this problem to both min-sum and sum-product inference, and focus on the later. In this approach the min-max inference problem is reduced to a sequence of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), which allows us to solve the problem by sampling from a uniform distribution over the set of solutions. We demonstrate how this scheme provides a message passing solution to several NP-hard combinatorial problems, such as minmax clustering (a.k.a. K-clustering), asymmetric K-center clustering problem, K-packing and the bottleneck traveling salesman problem. Furthermore, we theoretically relate the min-max reductions and several NP hard decision problems such as clique cover, set-cover, maximum clique and Hamiltonian cycle, therefore also providing message passing solutions for these problems. Experimental results suggest that message passing often provides near optimal min-max solutions for moderate size instances.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Siamak Ravanbakhsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravanbakhsh:Siamak", "Christopher Srinivasa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasa:Christopher", "Brendan J.
