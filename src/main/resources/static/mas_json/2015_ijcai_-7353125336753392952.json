{"title": "A Graph Kernel Based on the Jensen-Shannon Representation Alignment.", "fields": ["kernelization", "string kernel", "tree kernel", "kernel embedding of distributions", "graph kernel"], "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a novel graph kernel by aligning the Jensen-Shannon (JS) representations of vertices. We commence by describing how to compute the JS representation of a vertex by measuring the JS divergence (JSD) between the corresponding h-layer depth-based (DB) representations developed in [Bai et al., 2014a]). By aligning JS representations of vertices, we identify the correspondence between the vertices of two graphs and this allows us to construct a matching-based graph kernel. Unlike existing R-convolution kernels [Haussler, 1999] that roughly record the isomorphism information between any pair of substructures under a type of graph decomposition, the new kernel can be seen as an aligned subgraph kernel that incorporates explicit local correspondences of substructures (i.e., the local information graphs [Dehmer and Mowshowitz, 2011]) into the process of kernelization through the JS representation alignment. The new kernel thus addresses the drawback of neglecting the relative locations between substructures that arises in the R-convolution kernels. Experiments demonstrate that our kernel can easily outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels in terms of the classification accuracies.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Central University of Finance and Economics", "Xiamen University", "University of Nottingham", "Beihang University", "University of York"], "authors": ["Lu Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai_0001:Lu", "Zhihong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhihong", "Chaoyan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chaoyan", "Xiao Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai_0001:Xiao", "Edwin R.
