{"title": "Active Learning with a Drifting Distribution.", "fields": ["minimax", "machine learning", "mathematical optimization", "artificial intelligence", "active learning"], "abstract": "We study the problem of active learning in a stream-based setting, allowing the distribution of the examples to change over time. We prove upper bounds on the number of prediction mistakes and number of label requests for established disagreement-based active learning algorithms, both in the realizable case and under Tsybakov noise. We further prove minimax lower bounds for this problem.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Liu Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Liu"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
