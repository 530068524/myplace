{"title": "Multi-Task Active Learning for Linguistic Annotations.", "fields": ["syntax", "active learning", "named entity", "parse tree", "annotation"], "abstract": "We extend the classical single-task active learning (AL) approach. In the multi-task active learning (MTAL) paradigm, we select examples for several annotation tasks rather than for a single one as usually done in the context of AL. We introduce two MTAL metaprotocols, alternating selection and rank combination, and propose a method to implement them in practice. We experiment with a twotask annotation scenario that includes named entity and syntactic parse tree annotations on three different corpora. MTAL outperforms random selection and a stronger baseline, onesided example selection, in which one task is pursued using AL and the selected examples are provided also to the other task.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "University of Jena", "University of Jena"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Roi Reichart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reichart:Roi", "Katrin Tomanek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomanek:Katrin", "Udo Hahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hahn:Udo", "Ari Rappoport.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rappoport:Ari"], "pages": 9}
