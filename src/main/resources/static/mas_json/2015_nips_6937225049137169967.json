We consider a class of iterative stochastic policy optimization problems and analyze the resulting expected performance for each newly updated policy at each iteration. In particular, we employ concentration-of-measure inequalities to compute future expected cost and probability of constraint violation using empirical runs. A novel inequality bound is derived that accounts for the possibly unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratio resulting from iterative policy adaptation. The bound serves as a high-confidence certificate for providing future performance or safety guarantees. The approach is illustrated with a simple robot control scenario and initial steps towards applications to challenging aerial vehicle navigation problems are presented.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Marin Kobilarov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobilarov:Marin"], "pages": 9}
