The problem can be formulated and analyzed naturally in a rate-distortion framework, leading to an efficient algorithm that compares well with two previous one-class methods. The model can be also be extended to remove background clutter in clustering to improve cluster purity.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Koby Crammer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crammer:Koby", "Partha Pratim Talukdar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talukdar:Partha_Pratim", "Fernando C.
