{"title": "Differential Privacy with Imperfect Randomness.", "fields": ["laplace distribution", "impossibility", "imperfect", "randomness", "differential privacy"], "abstract": "In this work we revisit the question of basing cryptography on imperfect randomness. Bosley and Dodis TCC'07 showed that if a source of randomness $$\\mathcal {R}$$ is \"good enough\" to generate a secret key capable of encrypting k bits, then one can deterministically extract nearly k almost uniform bits from $$\\mathcal {R}$$, suggesting that traditional privacy notions namely, indistinguishability of encryption requires an \"extractable\" source of randomness. Other, even stronger impossibility results are known for achieving privacy under specific \"non-extractable\" sources of randomness, such as the $$\\gamma $$-Santha-Vazirani SV source, where each next bit has fresh entropy, but is allowed to have a small bias $$\\gamma < 1$$ possibly depending on prior bits.\n\nWe ask whether similar negative results also hold for a more recent notion of privacy called differential privacy Dwork et al., TCC'06, concentrating, in particular, on achieving differential privacy with the Santha-Vazirani source. We show that the answer is no. Specifically, we give a differentially private mechanism for approximating arbitrary \"low sensitivity\" functions that works even with randomness coming from a $$\\gamma $$-Santha-Vazirani source, for any $$\\gamma <1$$. This provides a somewhat surprising \"separation\" between traditional privacy and differential privacy with respect to imperfect randomness.\n\nInterestingly, the design of our mechanism is quite different from the traditional \"additive-noise\" mechanisms e.g., Laplace mechanism successfully utilized to achieve differential privacy with perfect randomness. Indeed, we show that any non-trivial \"SV-robust\" mechanism for our problem requires a demanding property called consistent sampling, which is strictly stronger than differential privacy, and cannot be satisfied by any additive-noise mechanism.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "Microsoft", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Yevgeniy Dodis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dodis:Yevgeniy", "Adriana L\u00f3pez-Alt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=oacute=pez=Alt:Adriana", "Ilya Mironov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mironov:Ilya", "Salil P.
