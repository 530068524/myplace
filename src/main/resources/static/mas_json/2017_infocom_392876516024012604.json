This paper proposes, a Measurement-Based Delay Optimal (MBDO) scheduler, which optimizes a cost function of the mean flow delays in a multi-class system, e.g,. web interactive, file downloads, etc. In this context the cost function expresses desired trade-offs amongst traffic classes reflecting heterogeneous QoE sensitivities which are nonlinear in the flow delays and/or system loads. To achieve optimality, MBDO scheduling uses measured system variables and knowledge (or measurement) of class flow-size distributions to adapt a weighted Gittins index scheduler. We show that under mild assumptions, and in a stationary regime, that MBDO scheduling is indeed asymptotically optimal. Perhaps more importantly, MBDO schedulers can self-optimize by adapting to slowly varying traffic loads, mixes and flow size distributions. Our extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness at realizing trade-offs and performance of the proposed approach.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Arjun Anand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anand:Arjun", "Gustavo de Veciana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veciana:Gustavo_de"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
