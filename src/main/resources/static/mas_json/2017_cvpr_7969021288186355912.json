We then study the implications of this observation on training a deep neural network for representing image patches in the context of descriptor based optical flow. We propose a metric learning method, which selects suitable negative samples based on the nature of the true match. This type of training produces a network that displays multiple strategies depending on the input and leads to state of the art results on the KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 optical flow benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tal Schuster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuster:Tal", "Lior Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf:Lior", "David Gadot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gadot:David"], "pages": 10}
