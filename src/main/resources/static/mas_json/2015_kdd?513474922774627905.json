However, this recommendation is very challenging compared to the traditional recommender systems. A user can visit only a limited number of spatial items, leading to a very sparse user-item matrix. Most of the items visited by a user are located within a short distance from where he/she lives, which makes it hard to recommend items when the user travels to a far away place. Moreover, user interests and behavior patterns may vary dramatically across different geographical regions. In light of this, we propose Geo-SAGE, a geographical sparse additive generative model for spatial item recommendation in this paper. Geo-SAGE considers both user personal interests and the preference of the crowd in the target region, by exploiting both the co-occurrence pattern of spatial items and the content of spatial items. To further alleviate the data sparsity issue, Geo-SAGE exploits the geographical correlation by smoothing the crowd's preferences over a well-designed spatial index structure called spatial pyramid. We conduct extensive experiments and the experimental results clearly demonstrate our Geo-SAGE model outperforms the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Northeastern University", "University of Queensland"], "authors": ["Weiqing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Weiqing", "Hongzhi Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Hongzhi", "Ling Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ling", "Yizhou Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yizhou", "Shazia Wasim Sadiq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadiq:Shazia_Wasim", "Xiaofang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiaofang"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
