This paper motivates the need for a new class of display technology that can more effectively blend with its environment and introduces the concept of self-organizing emergent displays as a vehicle to achieving this. The paper goes on to briefly describe Firefly, a prototype emergent display system, and evaluate its scalability, effectiveness, and user acceptance through experimental analysis and a field trial.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["Angie Chandler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandler:Angie", "Joe Finney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finney:Joe", "Carl Lewis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lewis:Carl", "Alan J.
