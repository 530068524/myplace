{"title": "FShell: Systematic Test Case Generation for Dynamic Analysis and Measurement.", "fields": ["scripting language", "program analysis", "database engine", "white box testing", "analogy"], "abstract": "Although the principal analogy between counterexample generation and white box testing has been repeatedly addressed, the usage patterns and performance requirements for software testing are quite different from formal verification. Our tool FS hell provides a versatile testing environment for C programs which supports both interactive explorative use and a rich scripting language. More than a frontend for software model checkers, FS hell is designed as a database engine which dispatches queries about the program to program analysis tools. We report on the integration of CBMC into FS hell and describe architectural modifications which support efficient test case generation.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Andreas Holzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holzer:Andreas", "Christian Schallhart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schallhart:Christian", "Michael Tautschnig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tautschnig:Michael", "Helmut Veith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veith:Helmut"], "pages": 5}
