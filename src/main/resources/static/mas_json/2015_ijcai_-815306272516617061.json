{"title": "Coherence Across Components in Cognitive Systems - One Ontology to Rule Them All.", "fields": ["suggested upper merged ontology", "upper ontology", "common knowledge", "process ontology", "ontology based data integration"], "abstract": "The integration of the various specialized components of cognitive systems poses a challenge, in particular for those architectures that combine planning, inference, and human-computer interaction (HCI). An approach is presented that exploits a single source of common knowledge contained in an ontology. Based upon the knowledge contained in it, specialized domain models for the cognitive systems' components can be generated automatically. Our integration targets planning in the form of hierarchical planning, being well-suited for HCI as it mimics planning done by humans. We show how the hierarchical structures of such planning domains can be (partially) inferred from declarative background knowledge. The same ontology furnishes the structure of the interaction between the cognitive system and the user. First, explanations of plans presented to users are enhanced by ontology explanations. Second, a dialog domain is created from the ontology coherent with the planning domain. We demonstrate the application of our technique in a fitness training scenario.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "A.P.
