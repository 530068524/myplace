{"title": "Letter-Phoneme Alignment: An Exploration.", "fields": ["data set", "phonetics", "expectation maximization algorithm", "integer programming", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Letter-phoneme alignment is usually generated by a straightforward application of the EM algorithm. We explore several alternative alignment methods that employ phonetics, integer programming, and sets of constraints, and propose a novel approach of refining the EM alignment by aggregation of best alignments. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the assortment of methods. We show that our proposed EM-Aggregation algorithm leads to the improvement of the state of the art in letter-to-phoneme conversion on several different data sets.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sittichai Jiampojamarn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiampojamarn:Sittichai", "Grzegorz Kondrak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kondrak:Grzegorz"], "pages": 9}
