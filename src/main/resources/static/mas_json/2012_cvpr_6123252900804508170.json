Typical PS models assume an object can be represented by a set of rigid parts connected with pairwise constraints that define the prior probability of part configurations. These models are widely used to represent non-rigid articulated objects such as humans and animals despite the fact that such objects have parts that deform non-rigidly. Here we define a new Deformable Structures (DS) model that is a natural extension of previous PS models and that captures the non-rigid shape deformation of the parts. Each part in a DS model is represented by a low-dimensional shape deformation space and pairwise potentials between parts capture how the shape varies with pose and the shape of neighboring parts. A key advantage of such a model is that it more accurately models object boundaries. This enables image likelihood models that are more discriminative than previous PS likelihoods. This likelihood is learned using training imagery annotated using a DS \u201cpuppet.\u201d We focus on a human DS model learned from 2D projections of a realistic 3D human body model and use it to infer human poses in images using a form of non-parametric belief propagation.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Silvia Zuffi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuffi:Silvia", "Oren Freifeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freifeld:Oren", "Michael J.
