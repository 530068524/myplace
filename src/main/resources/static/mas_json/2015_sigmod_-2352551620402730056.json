Selection queries involving UDF predicates tend to be expensive, either in terms of monetary cost or latency. In this paper, we study ways to efficiently evaluate selection queries with UDF predicates. We provide a family of techniques for processing queries at low cost while satisfying user-specified precision and recall constraints. Our techniques are applicable to a variety of scenarios including when selection probabilities of tuples are available beforehand, when this information is available but noisy, or when no such prior information is available. We also generalize our techniques to more complex queries. Finally, we test our techniques on real datasets, and show that they achieve significant savings in UDF evaluations of up to $80\\%$, while incurring only a small reduction in accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Stanford University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Manas Joglekar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joglekar:Manas", "Hector Garcia-Molina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia=Molina:Hector", "Aditya G.
