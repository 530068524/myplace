We choose an optimal algorithm with blocking in both shared memory and registers to satisfy the constraints of the Fermi memory hierarchy. Our optimization strategy is further guided by a performance modeling based on micro-architecture benchmarks. Our optimizations include software pipelining, use of vector memory operations, and instruction scheduling. Our best CUDA algorithm achieves comparable performance with the latest CUBLAS library 1 . We further improve upon this with an implementation in the native machine language, leading to 20% increase in performance. That is, the achieved peak performance (efficiency) is improved from 302Gflop/s (58%) to 362Gflop/s (70%).", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Nvidia", "Nvidia", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Guangming Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Guangming", "Linchuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Linchuan", "Sean Triechle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Triechle:Sean", "Everett H.
