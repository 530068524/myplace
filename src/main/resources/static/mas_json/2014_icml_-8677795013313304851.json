Thus, this paper introduces a technique for graph-based semi-supervised learning of histograms, derived from the theory of optimal transportation. Our method has several properties making it suitable for this application; in particular, its behavior can be characterized by the moments and shapes of the histograms at the labeled nodes. In addition, it can be used for histograms on non-standard domains like circles, revealing a strategy for manifold-valued semi-supervised learning. We also extend this technique to related problems such as smoothing distributions on graph nodes.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Max Planck Cent ... rucken, Germany"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Justin Solomon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solomon:Justin", "Raif M.
