{"title": "Supporting Comment Moderators in Identifying High Quality Online News Comments.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "multimedia", "computational journalism", "computer science"], "abstract": "Online comments submitted by readers of news articles can provide valuable feedback and critique, personal views and perspectives, and opportunities for discussion. The varying quality of these comments necessitates that publishers remove the low quality ones, but there is also a growing awareness that by identifying and highlighting high quality contributions this can promote the general quality of the community. In this paper we take a user-centered design approach towards developing a system, CommentIQ, which supports comment moderators in interactively identifying high quality comments using a combination of comment analytic scores as well as visualizations and flexible UI components. We evaluated this system with professional comment moderators working at local and national news outlets and provide insights into the utility and appropriateness of features for journalistic tasks, as well as how the system may enable or transform journalistic practices around online comments.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Deok Gun Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Deok_Gun", "Simranjit Singh Sachar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sachar:Simranjit_Singh", "Nicholas Diakopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakopoulos:Nicholas", "Niklas Elmqvist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elmqvist:Niklas"], "pages": 12}
