To achieve a high quality of experience, bitrate adaptation algorithm is required to strike a balance between response agility and video quality stability. Existing online algorithms select bitrates according to instantaneous throughput and buffer occupancy, achieving an agile reaction to changes but inducing video quality fluctuations due to the high dynamic of reference signals. In this paper, the idea of multi-step prediction is proposed to guide a better tradeoff, and the bitrate selection is formulated as a predictive control problem. With it, a generalized predictive control based approach is developed to calculate the optimal bitrate by minimizing the cost function over a moving look-ahead horizon. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented on a reference video player with performance evaluations conducted using realistic bandwidth traces. Experimental results show that the multi-step predictive control adaptation algorithm can achieve zero rebuffer event and 63.3% of reduction in bitrate switch.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Bo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Bo", "Fengyuan Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Fengyuan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
