{"title": "Joint Modeling of Argument Identification and Role Determination in Chinese Event Extraction with Discourse-Level Information.", "fields": ["machine learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Argument extraction is a challenging task in event extraction. However, most of previous studies focused on intra-sentence information and failed to extract inter-sentence arguments. This paper proposes a discourse-level joint model of argument identification and role determination to infer those inter-sentence arguments in a discourse. Moreover, to better represent the relationship among relevant event mentions and the relationship between an event mention and its arguments in a discourse, this paper introduces various kinds of corpus-based and discourse-based constraints in the joint model, either automatically learned or linguistically motivated. Evaluation on the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus justifies the effectiveness of our joint model over a strong baseline in Chinese argument extraction, in particular argument identification.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Soochow University", "Soochow University", "Soochow University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Peifeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Peifeng", "Qiaoming Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Qiaoming", "Guodong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guodong"], "pages": 7}
