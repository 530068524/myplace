{"title": "Planar Ultrametrics for Image Segmentation.", "fields": ["linear programming relaxation", "hierarchical clustering", "planar", "planar graph", "ultrametric space"], "abstract": "We study the problem of hierarchical clustering on planar graphs. We formulate this in terms of finding the closest ultrametric to a specified set of distances and solve it using an LP relaxation that leverages minimum cost perfect matching as a subroutine to efficiently explore the space of planar partitions. We apply our algorithm to the problem of hierarchical image segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "Experian Data L ...
