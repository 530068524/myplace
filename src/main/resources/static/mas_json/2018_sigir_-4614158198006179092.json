{"title": "IRevalOO: An Object Oriented Framework for Retrieval Evaluation.", "fields": ["usable", "object oriented programming", "terminology", "eval", "personalization"], "abstract": "We propose IRevalOO, a flexible Object Oriented framework that (i) can be used as-is as a replacement of the widely adopted trec\\_eval software, and (ii) can be easily extended (or \"instantiated'', in framework terminology) to implement different scenarios of test collection based retrieval evaluation. Instances of IRevalOO can provide a usable and convenient alternative to the state-of-the-art software commonly used by different initiatives (TREC, NTCIR, CLEF, FIRE, etc.). Also, those instances can be easily adapted to satisfy future customization needs of researchers, as: implementing and experimenting with new metrics, even based on new notions of relevance; using different formats for system output and \"qrels''; and in general visualizing, comparing, and managing retrieval evaluation results.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Udine", "University of Southampton", "University of Udine", "University of Udine"], "authors": ["Kevin Roitero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roitero:Kevin", "Eddy Maddalena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maddalena:Eddy", "Yannick Ponte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponte:Yannick", "Stefano Mizzaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mizzaro:Stefano"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
