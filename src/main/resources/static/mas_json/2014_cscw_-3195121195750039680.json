{"title": "Hybrid media consumption: how tweeting during a televised political debate influences the vote decision.", "fields": ["media consumption", "feeling", "voting", "microblogging", "e participation"], "abstract": "An increasing number of people are using microblogs to broadcast their thoughts in real time as they watch televised political events. Microblogging social network sites (SNSs) such as Twitter generate a parallel stream of information and opinion. It is presumed that the additional content enhances the viewing experience, but our experiment explores the validity of this assumption. We studied how tweeting, or passively observing Twitter during a debate, influenced affect, recall and vote decision. For most measures, participants' average feeling and recall toward the candidates did not depend on Twitter activity, but Twitter activity did matter for vote choice. People who actively tweeted changed their voting choice to reflect the majority sentiment on Twitter. Results are discussed in terms of the possibility that active tweeting leads to greater engagement but that it may also make people more susceptible to social influence.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Hawaii at Manoa", "University of Hawaii at Manoa", "University of Hawaii at Manoa", "University of Hawaii at Manoa", "University of Hawaii at Manoa"], "authors": ["Misa Maruyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maruyama:Misa", "Scott P.
