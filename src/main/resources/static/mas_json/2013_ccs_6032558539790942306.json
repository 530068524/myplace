Users in practice often need pseudonymity--sending messages intentionally linkable to each other but not to the sender--but pseudonymity in dynamic networks exposes users to intersection attacks. We present Buddies, the first systematic design for intersection attack resistance in practical anonymity systems. Buddies groups users dynamically into buddy sets, controlling message transmission to make buddies within a set behaviorally indistinguishable under traffic analysis. To manage the inevitable tradeoffs between anonymity guarantees and communication responsiveness, Buddies enables users to select independent attack mitigation policies for each pseudonym. Using trace-based simulations and a working prototype, we find that Buddies can guarantee non-trivial anonymity set sizes in realistic chat/microblogging scenarios, for both short-lived and long-lived pseudonyms.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["David Isaac Wolinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolinsky:David_Isaac", "Ewa Syta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Syta:Ewa", "Bryan Ford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ford:Bryan"], "pages": 14}
