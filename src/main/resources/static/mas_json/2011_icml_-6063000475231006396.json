The class of transductions that we can learn properly includes all subsequential transductions. These algorithms are based on a generalisation of distributional learning; we prove correctness of our algorithm under an identification in the limit model.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Royal Holloway, University of London"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Alexander Clark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clark:Alexander"], "pages": 8}
