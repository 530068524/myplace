Even for visual representation, there has been limited study of the impact on users of visual encodings and the strengths and weaknesses of Cartesian and Polar coordinate systems. In order to address this research gap, we performed a comprehensive graphical perception study that measured the effectiveness of time series visualisations with different interactions, visual encodings and coordinate systems for several tasks. Our results show that, while positional and colour visual encodings were better for most tasks, area visual encoding performed better for data comparison. Most importantly, we identified that introducing interactivity within time series visualisations considerably enhances the user experience, without any loss of efficiency or accuracy. We believe that our findings can greatly improve the development of visual analytics tools using time series visualisations in a variety of domains.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Leeds", "Heriot-Watt University", "Heriot-Watt University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Muhammad Adnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adnan:Muhammad", "Mike Just.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Just:Mike", "Lynne Baillie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baillie:Lynne"], "pages": 12}
