Our algorithm converges to the global optimal solution and can be used to solve general large-scale semidefinite programs and hence can be readily applied to a variety of machine learning problems. We show experimental results on three machine learning problems. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["University of Jena"], "authors": ["S\u00f6ren Laue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laue:S=ouml=ren"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
