The state space formulation allows for solving one-dimensional GP models in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and memory complexity. While existing literature has focused on the connection between GP regression and state space methods, the computational primitives allowing for inference using general likelihoods in combination with the Laplace approximation (LA), variational Bayes (VB), and assumed density filtering (ADF, a.k.a. single-sweep expectation propagation, EP) schemes has been largely overlooked. We present means of combining the efficient $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ state space methodology with existing inference methods. We extend existing methods, and provide unifying code implementing all approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Philips", "Aalto University", "Aalto University"], "authors": ["Hannes Nickisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nickisch:Hannes", "Arno Solin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solin:Arno", "Alexander Grigorevskiy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grigorevskiy:Alexander"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
