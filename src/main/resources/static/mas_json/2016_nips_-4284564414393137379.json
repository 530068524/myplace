{"title": "Greedy Feature Construction.", "fields": ["mean squared error", "effective method", "small number", "feature vector", "constructive"], "abstract": "We present an effective method for supervised feature construction. The main goal of the approach is to construct a feature representation for which a set of linear hypotheses is of sufficient capacity -- large enough to contain a satisfactory solution to the considered problem and small enough to allow good generalization from a small number of training examples. We achieve this goal with a greedy procedure that constructs features by empirically fitting squared error residuals. The proposed constructive procedure is consistent and can output a rich set of features. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated empirically by fitting a linear ridge regression model in the constructed feature space and our empirical results indicate a superior performance of our approach over competing methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Bonn", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Dino Oglic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oglic:Dino", "Thomas G\u00e4rtner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=auml=rtner:Thomas"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
