However, little work has been done that addresses the realistic considerations of uncertainties in sensor locations and evaluates their impacts on the accuracy of target localization and tracking. In this paper, we carry out a rigorous study of these problems using a computational geometry approach. We introduce the geometric structures of order-k max and min Voronoi Diagrams (VDs) and propose an algorithm to construct these diagrams. Based on order-k max and min VDs, efficient algorithms are developed to evaluate the likelihood of noisy sensor readings and kNN queries, which serve as building blocks in target localization and tracking under sensor location uncertainties.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Houston", "University of Houston"], "authors": ["Khuong Vu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vu:Khuong", "Rong Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Rong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
