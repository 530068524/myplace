Our new point process allows better approximation in application domains where events and intensities accelerate each other with correlated levels of contagion. We generalize a recent algorithm for simulating draws from Hawkes processes whose levels of excitation are stochastic processes, and propose a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo approach for model fitting. Our sampling procedure scales linearly with the number of required events and does not require stationarity of the point process. A modular inference procedure consisting of a combination between Gibbs and Metropolis Hastings steps is put forward. We recover expectation maximization as a special case. Our general approach is illustrated for contagion following geometric Brownian motion and exponential Langevin dynamics.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["London School of Economics and Political Science", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Young Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Young", "Kar Wai Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Kar_Wai", "Cheng Soon Ong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ong:Cheng_Soon"], "pages": 10}
