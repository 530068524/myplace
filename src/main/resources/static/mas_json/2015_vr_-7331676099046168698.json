In particular, view-dependent elements such as holograms are interesting, but the expertise of individuals performing the task varies greatly. Augmented Reality systems can provide all relevant information on standard mobile devices. Hologram verification still takes long and causes considerable load for the user. We aim to address this drawback by first presenting a work flow for recording and automatic matching of hologram patches. Several user interfaces for hologram verification are presented, aiming to noticeably reduce verification time. We evaluate the most promising interfaces in a user study with prototype applications running on off-the-shelf hardware. Our results indicate that there is a significant difference in capture time between interfaces but that users do not prefer the fastest interface.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "authors": ["Andreas Hartl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hartl:Andreas", "Jens Grubert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grubert:Jens", "Christian Reinbacher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reinbacher:Christian", "Clemens Arth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arth:Clemens", "Dieter Schmalstieg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmalstieg:Dieter"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
