We present an efficient algorithm for this problem and show that, under standard conditions on the linear system, its regret with respect to an optimal linear policy grows as O(log2T), where T is the number of rounds of the game. We also study a problem with adversarially chosen transition dynamics; we present an exponentially-weighted average algorithm for this problem, and we give regret bounds that grow as O(\u221aT).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yasin Abbasi-Yadkori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbasi=Yadkori:Yasin", "Peter L.
