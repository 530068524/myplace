{"title": "Field tests and indoor emulation of distributed autonomous multi-hop vehicle-to-vehicle communications over TV white space.", "fields": ["vehicle to vehicle", "white spaces", "emulation", "hop", "channel"], "abstract": "Vehicular networking has significant potential to enable diverse range of applications, including safety and convenience. As the number of vehicles and applications using the specially designated wireless spectrum grow, one can expect substantial increase in the bandwidth requirements. In this paper and demonstration, we advocate that dynamic spectrum access techniques facilitating the utilization of white spaces for vehicles will be the first step towards solving the expected spectrum shortage. In the demonstration, we will introduce field tests of a multi-hop inter-vehicle communication system with distributed and autonomous TV white space channel selection, performed in Japan from January to February 2012. Furthermore, in addition to the field test videos, we will show an indoor emulation of the entire system used during the field tests in the vehicles.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Toyota", "Toyota", "Toyota", "Toyota", "University of Electro-Communications", "Toyota", "Toyota", "Toyota", "Toyota", "University of Electro-Communications"], "authors": ["Onur Altintas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altintas:Onur", "Yutaka Ihara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ihara:Yutaka", "Haris Kremo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kremo:Haris", "Hideaki Tanaka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka:Hideaki", "Masaaki Ohtake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ohtake:Masaaki", "Takeo Fujii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujii:Takeo", "Chikara Yoshimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshimura:Chikara", "Keisuke Ando.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ando:Keisuke", "Kazuya Tsukamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsukamoto:Kazuya", "Masato Tsuru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsuru:Masato", "Yuji Oie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oie:Yuji"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
