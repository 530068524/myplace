Both algorithms rely on the high-level representation and efficient solvers of Answer Set Programming. We apply these algorithms to find answers and explanations to some complex queries related to drug discovery, over PHARMGKB, DRUG-BANK, BIOGRID, CTD and SIDER.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Sabanc\u0131 University", "Sabanc\u0131 University", "Sabanc\u0131 University", "Research and De ... tanbul, Turkey"], "authors": ["Esra Erdem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erdem_0001:Esra", "Yelda Erdem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erdem:Yelda", "Halit Erdogan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erdogan:Halit", "Umut \u00d6ztok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ouml=ztok:Umut"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
