Participants completed tasks in one of two conditions, where the task-relevant information either appeared salient or non-salient. Our analysis provides insights into relationships between saliency, focused attention, and affect. Participants reported more distraction in the non-salient condition, and non-salient information was slower to find than salient. Lack-of-saliency led to a negative impact on affect, while saliency maintained positive affect, suggesting its helpfulness. Participants reported that it was easier to focus in the salient condition, although there was no significant improvement in the focused attention scale rating. Finally, this study suggests user interest in the topic is a good predictor of focused attention, which in turn is a good predictor of positive affect. These results suggest that enhancing saliency of user-interested topics seems a good strategy for boosting user engagement.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Dalhousie University", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Lori McCay-Peet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCay=Peet:Lori", "Mounia Lalmas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lalmas:Mounia", "Vidhya Navalpakkam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navalpakkam:Vidhya"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
