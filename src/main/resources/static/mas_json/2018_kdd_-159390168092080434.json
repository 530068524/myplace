{"title": "A Data-Driven Three-Layer Algorithm for Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with 3D Container Loading Constraint.", "fields": ["vehicle routing problem", "leaps", "data driven", "transportation planning", "acceptance testing"], "abstract": "Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with 3D Loading Constraints (3L-SDVRP) can be seen as the most important problem in large-scale manufacturing logistics. The goal is to devise a strategy consisting of three NP-hard planning components: vehicle routing, cargo splitting and container loading, which shall be jointly optimized for cost savings. The problem is an enhanced variant of the classical logistics problem 3L-CVRP, and its complexity leaps beyond current studies of solvability. Our solution employs a novel data-driven three-layer search algorithm (DTSA), which we designed to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional meta-heuristic approaches, through learning from data and from simulation.   A detailed experimental evaluation on real data shows our algorithm is versatile in solving this practical complex constrained multi-objective optimization problem, and our framework may be of general interest. DTSA performs much better than the state-of-the-art algorithms both in efficiency and optimization performance. Our algorithm has been deployed in the UAT (User Acceptance Test) environment; conservative estimates suggest that the full usage of our algorithm would save millions of dollars in logistics costs per year, besides savings due to automation and more efficient routing.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Huawei", "Huawei", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Huawei"], "authors": ["Xijun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xijun", "Mingxuan Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Mingxuan", "Di Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Di", "Jianguo Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Jianguo", "Jia Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Jia"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
