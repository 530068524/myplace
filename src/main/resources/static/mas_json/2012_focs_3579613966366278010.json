Mehlhorn and Schmidt [1982] were the first to suggest matrix-rank as one such measure. Among other things, they showed log rank F(M) CC(M) rankF2(M), where  CC ( M ) denotes the (deterministic) communication complexity of the function associated with  M , and the rank on the left-hand side is over any field  F  and on the right-hand side it is over the two-element field  F 2. For certain matrices  M , communication complexity equals the right-hand side, and this completely settles the question of \u201ccommunication complexity vs.  F 2-rank\u201d.   Here we reopen this question by pointing out that, when  M  has an additional natural combinatorial property---high discrepancy with respect to distributions which are uniform over submatrices---then communication complexity can be sublinear in  F 2-rank. Assuming the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa (PFR) conjecture in additive combinatorics, we show that CC(M) O(rank F2(M)/log rank F2(M)) for any matrix  M  which satisfies this combinatorial property.   We also observe that if  M  has low rank over the reals, then it has low rank over  F 2 and it additionally satisfies this combinatorial property. As a corollary, our results also give the first (conditional) sublinear bound on communication complexity in terms of rank over the reals, a result improved later by Lovett [2014].   Our proof is based on the study of the \u201capproximate duality conjecture\u201d which was suggested by Ben-Sasson and Zewi [2011] and studied there in connection to the PFR conjecture. First, we improve the bounds on approximate duality assuming the PFR conjecture. Then, we use the approximate duality conjecture (with improved bounds) to get our upper bound on the communication complexity of low-rank matrices.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of California, San Diego", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Eli Ben-Sasson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Sasson:Eli", "Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar", "Noga Ron-Zewi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ron=Zewi:Noga"], "pages": 10}
