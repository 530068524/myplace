In this paper, we formulate the delineation problem as one of solving a Quadratic Mixed Integer Program (Q-MIP) in a graph of potential paths, which can be done optimally up to a very small tolerance. We further propose a novel approach to weighting these paths, which results in a Q-MIP solution that accurately matches the ground truth. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art technique based on the k-Minimum Spanning Tree formulation on a 2D dataset of aerial images and a 3D dataset of confocal microscopy stacks.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Engin T\u00fcretken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/T=uuml=retken:Engin", "Fethallah Benmansour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benmansour:Fethallah", "Pascal Fua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fua:Pascal"], "pages": 8}
