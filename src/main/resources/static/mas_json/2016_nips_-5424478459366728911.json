It aims at reconstructing MR image from a small number of under-sampled data in k-space, and accelerating the data acquisition in MRI. To improve the current MRI system in reconstruction accuracy and computational speed, in this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture, dubbed ADMM-Net. ADMM-Net is defined over a data flow graph, which is derived from the iterative procedures in Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for optimizing a CS-based MRI model. In the training phase, all parameters of the net, e.g., image transforms, shrinkage functions, etc., are discriminatively trained end-to-end using L-BFGS algorithm. In the testing phase, it has computational overhead similar to ADMM but uses optimized parameters learned from the training data for CS-based reconstruction task. Experiments on MRI image reconstruction under different sampling ratios in k-space demonstrate that it significantly improves the baseline ADMM algorithm and achieves high reconstruction accuracies with fast computational speed.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Yan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yan", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian", "Huibin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Huibin", "Zongben Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Zongben"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
