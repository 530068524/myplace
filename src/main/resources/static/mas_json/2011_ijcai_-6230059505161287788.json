While this is a very attractive solution concept, many elections do not have a Condorcet winner. In this paper, we propose a setvalued relaxation of this concept, which we call a Condorcet winning set: such sets consist of alternatives that collectively dominate any other alternative. We also consider a more general version of this concept, where instead of domination by a majority of voters we require domination by a given fraction \u0398 of voters; we refer to this concept as \u0398-winning set. We explore social choice-theoretic and algorithmic aspects of these solution concepts, both theoretically and empirically.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Paris Dauphine University", "Paris Dauphine University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Edith Elkind.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkind:Edith", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Abdallah Saffidine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saffidine:Abdallah"], "pages": 6}
