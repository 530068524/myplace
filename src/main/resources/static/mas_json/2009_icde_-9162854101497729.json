{"title": "QuickStart: An Upfront Client-Based Design Advisor for Parallel Data Warehouses.", "fields": ["physical design", "heuristics", "laptop", "flat file database", "data warehouse"], "abstract": "QuickStart is a tool to automate the physical design of data warehouses for HP's Neoview system. It has been researched and prototyped at HP Labs with close interaction from Neoview design experts. It embodies heuristics and best practices of the experts to search for candidate physical features and uses cost calculations to recommend the features that result in good designs. It has some unique characteristics that differentiate it from other physical design advisors. In particular, it is the only advisor that is client-based, does not require a DBMS server installation and can work off a laptop by simply connecting to the customers' flat files. Another unique characteristic of QuickStart is that it provides the rationale for its recommendations.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Mal\u00fa Castellanos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castellanos:Mal=uacute=", "Ivo Jimenez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jimenez:Ivo", "Neal Coddington.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coddington:Neal", "Hans Zeller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeller:Hans", "Steven Whang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whang:Steven", "Umeshwar Dayal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dayal:Umeshwar"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
