{"title": "HaptiColor: Interpolating Color Information as Haptic Feedback to Assist the Colorblind.", "fields": ["haptic technology", "wearable computer", "computer vision", "artificial intelligence", "interpolation"], "abstract": "Most existing colorblind aids help their users to distinguish and recognize colors but not compare them. We present HaptiColor, an assistive wristband that encodes discrete color information into spatiotemporal vibrations to support colorblind users to recognize and compare colors. We ran three experiments: the first found the optimal number and placement of motors around the wrist-worn prototype, and the second tested the optimal way to represent discrete points between the vibration motors. Results suggested that using three vibration motors and pulses of varying duration to encode proximity information in spatiotemporal patterns is the optimal solution. Finally, we evaluated the HaptiColor prototype and encodings with six colorblind participants. Our results show that the participants were able to easily understand the encodings and perform color comparison tasks accurately (94.4% to 100%).", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Chalmers University of Technology", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Chalmers University of Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Marta Gonzalez Carcedo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carcedo:Marta_Gonzalez", "Soon Hau Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Soon_Hau", "Simon T.
