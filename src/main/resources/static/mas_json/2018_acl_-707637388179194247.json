{"title": "Simple and Effective Text Simplification Using Semantic and Neural Methods.", "fields": ["operator", "machine translation", "parsing", "text simplification", "sentence"], "abstract": "Sentence splitting is a major simplification operator. Here we present a simple and efficient splitting algorithm based on an automatic semantic parser. After splitting, the text is amenable for further fine-tuned simplification operations. In particular, we show that neural Machine Translation can be effectively used in this situation. Previous application of Machine Translation for simplification suffers from a considerable disadvantage in that they are over-conservative, often failing to modify the source in any way. Splitting based on semantic parsing, as proposed here, alleviates this issue. Extensive automatic and human evaluation shows that the proposed method compares favorably to the state-of-the-art in combined lexical and structural simplification.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "University of Edinburgh", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Omri Abend.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abend:Omri", "Ari Rappoport.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rappoport:Ari", "Elior Sulem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sulem:Elior"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2018", "pages": 12}
