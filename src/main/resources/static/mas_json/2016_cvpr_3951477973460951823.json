{"title": "Multi-scale Patch Aggregation (MPA) for Simultaneous Detection and Segmentation.", "fields": ["coco", "segmentation", "pattern recognition", "computer vision", "computation"], "abstract": "Aiming at simultaneous detection and segmentation (SD-S), we propose a proposal-free framework, which detect and segment object instances via mid-level patches. We design a unified trainable network on patches, which is followed by a fast and effective patch aggregation algorithm to infer object instances. Our method benefits from end-to-end training. Without object proposal generation, computation time can also be reduced. In experiments, our method yields results 62.1% and 61.8% in terms of mAPr on VOC2012 segmentation val and VOC2012 SDS val, which are state-of-the-art at the time of submission. We also report results on Microsoft COCO test-std/test-dev dataset in this paper.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shu", "Xiaojuan Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Xiaojuan", "Jianping Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jianping", "Hong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hong", "Jiaya Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jiaya"], "pages": 9}
