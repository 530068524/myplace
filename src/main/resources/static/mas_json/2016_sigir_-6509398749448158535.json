{"title": "Utilizing Focused Relevance Feedback.", "fields": ["relevance feedback", "machine learning", "information retrieval", "mixture model", "language model"], "abstract": "We present a novel study of ad hoc retrieval methods utilizing document-level relevance feedback and/or  focused relevance feedback ; namely, passages marked as (non-)relevant. The first method uses a novel mixture model that integrates relevant and non-relevant information at the language model level. The second method fuses retrieval scores produced by using relevant and non-relevant information separately. Empirical exploration attests to the merits of our methods, and sheds light on the effectiveness of using and integrating relevance feedback for textual units of varying granularities.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Elinor Brondwine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brondwine:Elinor", "Anna Shtok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shtok:Anna", "Oren Kurland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurland:Oren"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
