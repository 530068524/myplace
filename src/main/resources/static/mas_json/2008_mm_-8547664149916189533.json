For this goal, we present a framework that integrates automatically extracted nonverbal cues and dominance prediction models. Easily computable audio and visual activity cues are automatically extracted from cameras and microphones. Such nonverbal cues, correlated to human display and perception of dominance, are well documented in the social psychology literature. The effectiveness of the cues were systematically investigated as single cues as well as in unimodal and multimodal combinations using unsupervised and supervised learning approaches for dominant clique estimation. Our framework was evaluated on a five-hour public corpus of teamwork meetings with third-party manual annotation of perceived dominance. Our best approaches can exactly predict the dominant clique with 80.8% accuracy in four-person meetings in which multiple human annotators agree on their judgments of perceived dominance.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Idiap Research Institute", "Idiap Research Institute", "University of California, Berkeley", "Idiap Research Institute"], "authors": ["Dinesh Babu Jayagopi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jayagopi:Dinesh_Babu", "Hayley Hung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hung:Hayley", "Chuohao Yeo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeo:Chuohao", "Daniel Gatica-Perez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gatica=Perez:Daniel"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
