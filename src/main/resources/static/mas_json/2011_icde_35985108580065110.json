{"title": "XClean: Providing valid spelling suggestions for XML keyword queries.", "fields": ["typographical error", "xml validation", "probabilistic logic", "spelling", "language model"], "abstract": "An important facility to aid keyword search on XML data is suggesting alternative queries when user queries contain typographical errors. Query suggestion thus can improve users' search experience by avoiding returning empty result or results of poor qualities. In this paper, we study the problem of effectively and efficiently providing quality query suggestions for keyword queries on an XML document. We illustrate certain biases in previous work and propose a principled and general framework, XClean, based on the state-of-the-art language model. Compared with previous methods, XClean can accommodate different error models and XML keyword query semantics without losing rigor. Algorithms have been developed that compute the top-k suggestions efficiently. We performed an extensive experiment study using two large-scale real datasets. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "Swinburne University of Technology", "Swinburne University of Technology"], "authors": ["Yifei Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yifei", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0011:Wei", "Jianxin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianxin", "Chengfei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chengfei"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
