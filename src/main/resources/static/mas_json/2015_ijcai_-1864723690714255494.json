We focus on improving MaxHS--one of the most successful recent MaxSAT algorithms-- via SAT-based preprocessing. We show that employing SAT-based preprocessing via the so-called labelled CNF (LCNF) framework before calling MaxHS can in some cases greatly degrade the performance of the solver. As a remedy, we propose a lifting of MaxHS that works directly on LCNFs, allowing for a tighter integration of SAT-based preprocessing and MaxHS. Our empirical results on standard crafted and industrial weighted partial MaxSAT Evaluation benchmarks show overall improvements over the original MaxHS algorithm both with and without SAT-based preprocessing.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki", "University of Helsinki"], "authors": ["Jeremias Berg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berg:Jeremias", "Paul Saikko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saikko:Paul", "Matti J\u00e4rvisalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=auml=rvisalo:Matti"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
