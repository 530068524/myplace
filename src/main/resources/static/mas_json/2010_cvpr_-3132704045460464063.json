Random trees are trained to learn a mapping between densely-sampled feature patches and their corresponding votes in a spatio-temporal-action Hough space. The leaves of the trees form a discriminative multi-class codebook that share features between the action classes and vote for action centers in a probabilistic manner. Using low-level features such as gradients and optical flow, we demonstrate that Hough-voting can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several datasets covering a wide range of action-recognition scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (289)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Angela Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Angela", "J\u00fcrgen Gall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gall:J=uuml=rgen", "Luc J.
