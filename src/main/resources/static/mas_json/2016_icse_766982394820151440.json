{"title": "Finding security bugs in web applications using a catalog of access control patterns.", "fields": ["security pattern", "web application security", "security bug", "software bug", "web application"], "abstract": "We propose a specification-free technique for finding missing security checks in web applications using a  catalog of access control patterns  in which each pattern models a common access control use case. Our implementation, S pace , checks that every data exposure allowed by an application's code matches an allowed exposure from a security pattern in our catalog. The only user-provided input is a mapping from application types to the types of the catalog; the rest of the process is entirely automatic. In an evaluation on the 50 most watched Ruby on Rails applications on Github, S pace  reported 33 possible bugs---23 previously unknown security bugs, and 10 false positives.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Joseph P.
