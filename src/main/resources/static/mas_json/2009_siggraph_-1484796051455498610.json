An overrepresentation of conserved adenosines flanking the seed complementary sites in mRNAs indicates that primary sequence determinants can supplement base pairing to specify miRNA target recognition. In a four-genome analysis of 3\u2032 UTRs, approximately 13,000 regulatory relationships were detected above the estimate of false-positive predictions, thereby implicating as miRNA targets more than 5300 human genes, which represented 30% of our gene set. Targeting was also detected in open reading frames. In sum, well over one third of human genes appear to be conserved miRNA targets.", "citation": "Citations (10,917)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Missouri", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "National Institute of Technology Calicut", "National Institute of Technology Calicut", "National Institute of Technology Calicut", "Howard Hughes M ... , MA 02139, USA", "Rosetta Inpharm ... , WA 98109, USA", "Rosetta Inpharm ... , WA 98109, USA", "Cancer Biology"], "authors": ["Satoshi Takahashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takahashi:Satoshi"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
