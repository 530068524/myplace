{"title": "Computing Datalog Rewritings Beyond Horn Ontologies.", "fields": ["transitive relation", "p", "web ontology language", "ontology language", "datalog"], "abstract": "Rewriting-based approaches for answering queries over an OWL 2 DL ontology have so far been developed mainly for Horn fragments of OWL 2 DL. In this paper, we study the possibilities of answering queries over non-Horn ontologies using datalog rewritings. We prove that this is impossible in general even for very simple ontology languages, and even if PTIME = NP. Furthermore, we present a resolution-based procedure for SHI ontologies that, in case it terminates, produces a datalog rewriting of the ontology. We also show that our procedure necessarily terminates on DL-LiteboolH,+ ontologies--an extension of OWL 2 QL with transitive roles and Boolean connectives.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "National Technical University of Athens", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Bernardo Cuenca Grau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grau:Bernardo_Cuenca", "Boris Motik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Motik:Boris", "Giorgos Stoilos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoilos:Giorgos", "Ian Horrocks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horrocks:Ian"], "pages": 7}
