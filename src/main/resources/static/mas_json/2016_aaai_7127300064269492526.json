However, the recommendation quality is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a simple yet promising algorithm. We fill the user-item matrix based on a low-rank assumption and simultaneously keep the original information. To do that, a nonconvex rank relaxation rather than the nuclear norm is adopted to provide a better rank approximation and an efficient optimization strategy is designed. A comprehensive set of experiments on real datasets demonstrates that our method pushes the accuracy of Top-N recommendation to a new level.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Southern Illinois University Carbondale", "Southern Illinois University Carbondale", "Southern Illinois University Carbondale"], "authors": ["Zhao Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Zhao", "Chong Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Chong", "Qiang Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Qiang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
