Guarantees of correctness exist under the assumption that the data is sampled from a model. In this paper, we propose a framework, in which we obtain \"correctness\" guarantees without assuming the data comes from a model. The guarantees we obtain depend instead on the statistics of the data that can be checked. We also show that this framework ties in with the existing model-based framework, and that we can exploit results in model-based recovery, as well as strengthen the results existing in that area of research.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Yali Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Yali", "Marina Meila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meila:Marina"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
