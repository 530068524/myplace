Our main results are:   (1) An explicit seeded non-malleable extractor with error N  and seed length  d = O (log n )+ O (log(1/N )loglog(1/N )), that supports min-entropy  k =I\u00a9( d ) and outputs I\u00a9( k ) bits. Combined with the protocol by Dodis and Wichs, this gives a two round privacy amplification protocol with optimal entropy loss in the presence of an active adversary, for all security parameters up to I\u00a9( k /log k ), where  k  is the min-entropy of the shared weak random source. Previously, the best known seeded non-malleable extractors require seed length and min-entropy  O (log n )+log(1/N )2  O \u00e2  loglog(1/N ) , and only give two round privacy amplification protocols with optimal entropy loss for security parameter up to  k /2  O (\u00e2  log k ) .   (2) An explicit non-malleable two-source extractor for min entropy  k  \u00e2 \ufffd (1\u00e2  I\ufffd) n , some constant I\ufffd>0, that outputs I\u00a9( k ) bits with error 2 \u00e2  I\u00a9( n /log n ) . We further show that we can efficiently uniformly sample from the pre-image of any output of the extractor. Combined with the connection found by Cheraghchi and Guruswami this gives a non-malleable code in the two-split-state model with relative rate I\u00a9(1/log n ). This exponentially improves previous constructions, all of which only achieve rate  n  \u00e2  I\u00a9(1) .   (3) Combined with the techniques by Ben-Aroya et. al, our non-malleable extractors give a two-source extractor for min-entropy  O (log n  loglog n ), which also implies a  K -Ramsey graph on  N  vertices with   K =(log N )  O (logloglog N ) . Previously the best known two-source extractor by Ben-Aroya et. al requires min-entropy log n  2  O (\u00e2  log n ) , which gives a Ramsey graph with  K =(log N ) 2  O (\u00e2  logloglog N )  . We further show a way to reduce the problem of constructing seeded non-malleable extractors to the problem of constructing non-malleable independent source extractors. Using the non-malleable 10-source extractor with optimal error by Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman, we give a 10-source extractor for min-entropy  O (log n ). Previously the best known extractor for such min-entropy by Cohen and Schulman requires  O (loglog n ) sources.   Independent of our work, Cohen obtained similar results to (1) and the two-source extractor, except the dependence on N  is log(1/N ) poly  loglog(1/N ) and the two-source extractor requires min-entropy log n   poly  loglog n .", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xin"], "pages": 13}
