{"title": "Efficient process mapping in geo-distributed cloud data centers.", "fields": ["performance improvement", "cloud computing", "data analysis", "grid", "distributed computing"], "abstract": "Recently, various applications including data analytics and machine learning have been developed for geo-distributed cloud data centers. For those applications, the ways to map parallel processes to physical nodes (i.e., \"process mapping\") could significantly impact the performance of the applications because of non-uniform communication cost in such geo-distributed environments. While process mapping has been widely studied in grid/cluster environments, few of the existing studies have considered the problem in geo-distributed cloud environments. In this paper, we propose a novel model to formulate the geo-distributed process mapping problem and develop a new method to efficiently find the near optimal solution. Our algorithm considers both the network communication performance of geo-distributed data centers as well as the communication matrix of the target application. Evaluation results with real experiments on Amazon EC2 and simulations demonstrate that our proposal achieves significant performance improvement (50% on average) compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Shenzhen University", "National University of Singapore", "Tsinghua University", "TuSimple"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Amelie Chi Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Amelie_Chi", "Yifan Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Yifan", "Bingsheng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Bingsheng", "Jidong Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Jidong"], "pages": 12}
