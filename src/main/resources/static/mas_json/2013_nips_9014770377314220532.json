To this end, we first propose a multiclass, hierarchical data dependent bound on the generalization error of classifiers deployed in large-scale taxonomies. This bound provides an explanation to several empirical results reported in the literature, related to the performance of flat and hierarchical classifiers. We then introduce another type of bound targeting the approximation error of a family of classifiers, and derive from it features used in a meta-classifier to decide which nodes to prune (or flatten) in a large-scale taxonomy. We finally illustrate the theoretical developments through several experiments conducted on two widely used taxonomies.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Joseph Fourier University", "Joseph Fourier University", "Joseph Fourier University", "Joseph Fourier University"], "authors": ["Rohit Babbar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babbar:Rohit", "Ioannis Partalas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Partalas:Ioannis", "\u00c9ric Gaussier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaussier:=Eacute=ric", "Massih-Reza Amini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amini:Massih=Reza"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
