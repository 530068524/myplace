{"title": "KOGNAC: Efficient Encoding of Large Knowledge Graphs.", "fields": ["web application", "approximation algorithm", "rdf", "sparql", "locality"], "abstract": "Many Web applications require efficient querying of large Knowledge Graphs (KGs). We propose KOGNAC, a dictionary-encoding algorithm designed to improve SPARQL querying with a judicious combination of statistical and semantic techniques. In KOGNAC, frequent terms are detected with a frequency approximation algorithm and encoded to maximise compression. Infrequent terms are semantically grouped into ontological classes and encoded to increase data locality. We evaluated KOGNAC in combination with state-of-the-art RDF engines, and observed that it significantly improves SPARQL querying on KGs with up to 1B edges.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["VU University Amsterdam", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Jacopo Urbani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urbani:Jacopo", "Sourav Dutta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dutta:Sourav", "Sairam Gurajada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurajada:Sairam", "Gerhard Weikum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weikum:Gerhard"], "pages": 7}
