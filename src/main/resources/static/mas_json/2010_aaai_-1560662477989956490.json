{"title": "A Novel Transition Based Encoding Scheme for Planning as Satisfiability.", "fields": ["theoretical computer science", "formalism", "satisfiability", "strips", "encoding"], "abstract": "Planning as satisfiability is a principal approach to planning with many eminent advantages. The existing planning as satisfiability techniques usually use encodings compiled from the STRIPS formalism. We introduce a novel SAT encoding scheme based on the SAS+formalism. It exploits the structural information in the SAS+ formalism, resulting in more compact SAT instances and reducing the number of clauses by up to 50 fold. Our results show that this encoding scheme improves upon the STRIPS-based encoding, in terms of both time and memory efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "authors": ["Ruoyun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Ruoyun", "Yixin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yixin", "Weixiong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Weixiong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
