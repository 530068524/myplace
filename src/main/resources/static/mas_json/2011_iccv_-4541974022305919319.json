{"title": "Domain adaptation for object recognition: An unsupervised approach.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "grassmannian", "geodesic", "linear subspace", "unsupervised learning"], "abstract": "Adapting the classifier trained on a source domain to recognize instances from a new target domain is an important problem that is receiving recent attention. In this paper, we present one of the first studies on unsupervised domain adaptation in the context of object recognition, where we have labeled data only from the source domain (and therefore do not have correspondences between object categories across domains). Motivated by incremental learning, we create intermediate representations of data between the two domains by viewing the generative subspaces (of same dimension) created from these domains as points on the Grassmann manifold, and sampling points along the geodesic between them to obtain subspaces that provide a meaningful description of the underlying domain shift. We then obtain the projections of labeled source domain data onto these subspaces, from which a discriminative classifier is learnt to classify projected data from the target domain. We discuss extensions of our approach for semi-supervised adaptation, and for cases with multiple source and target domains, and report competitive results on standard datasets.", "citation": "Citations (572)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Raghuraman Gopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalan:Raghuraman", "Ruonan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ruonan", "Rama Chellappa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chellappa:Rama"], "pages": 8}
