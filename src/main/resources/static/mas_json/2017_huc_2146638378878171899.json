A Reader reads a pre-selected poem to a Readee in front of an Audience. The Readee, who sits comfortably and listens to the poem, is instrumented with two primary biosensors: an OpenBCI Electroencephalogram (EEG) and an electromyogram (EMG) sensor. The Reader receives direct sensory feedback from these sensors in the form of a vibration band and heat gloves. Projected behind the Reader and Readee is the text being read, with keywords replaced by empty boxes. New words will appear that are selected according to the Readee's emotional state -thanks to an algorithm that interprets her/his biosignals. With the contrast and similarities between the spoken and projected poems, the Audience senses the emotional connection between the Reader and Readee as it shifts through states of resonance and dissonance, calm and stress.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["James Rosenthal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenthal:James", "Gabrielle Benabdallah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benabdallah:Gabrielle"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
