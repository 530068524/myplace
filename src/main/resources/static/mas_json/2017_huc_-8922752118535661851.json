{"title": "Design of a 3D printed insole with embedded plantar pressure sensor arrays.", "fields": ["analog signal", "android", "3d printing", "resistive touchscreen", "multiplexer"], "abstract": "Taking advantage of additive manufacturing and 3D printing, we have designed a 3D printed insole with embedded plantar pressure sensor arrays. 3D printing allowed us to uniquely design a multitude of sensors. With the use of extrusion-based 3D printers, we produced a model that printed both the resistive circuits and a complete insole simultaneously. These distinctive technologies have given us the capability to capture valuable pressure data from the insole of the foot. Analog signals sent from the pressure sensor arrays are received and processed through an attached multiplexer designed specifically for this application. The signal is then digitized and transmitted over the SPI to a microcontroller via Bluetooth Low Energy, to an android device to allow the user to easily record and interpret the pressure data in real-time. The android device houses a pressure mapping view to show the gradient of force throughout the insole.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Virginia Commonwealth University", "Virginia Commonwealth University", "Virginia Commonwealth University", "Virginia Commonwealth University", "Virginia Commonwealth University"], "authors": ["Chad Majewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majewski:Chad", "Andrew Perkins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perkins:Andrew", "Derek Faltz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faltz:Derek", "Fawei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Fawei", "Hong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Hong", "Weijun Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Weijun"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
