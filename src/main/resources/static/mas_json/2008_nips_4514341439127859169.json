It is parameterised in a discriminative framework and has polynomial time algorithms for learning and inference. Importantly, we develop efficient algorithms for learning and constrained inference in a partially-supervised setting, which is important issue in practice where labels can only be obtained sparsely. We demonstrate the HSCRF in two applications: (i) recognising human activities of daily living (ADLs) from indoor surveillance cameras, and (ii) noun-phrase chunking. We show that the HSCRF is capable of learning rich hierarchical models with reasonable accuracy in both fully and partially observed data cases.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Curtin University", "Curtin University", "Curtin University", "SRI International"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Tran The Truyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Truyen:Tran_The", "Dinh Q.
