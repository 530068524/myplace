We then apply it to Mylar, a framework that uses multi-key searchable encryption (MKSE) to build Web applications on top of encrypted data.   We demonstrate that (1) the Popa-Zeldovich model for MKSE does not imply security against either passive or active attacks; (2) Mylar-based Web applications reveal users' data and queries to passive and active adversarial servers; and (3) Mylar is generically insecure against active attacks due to system design flaws. Our results show that the problem of securing client-server applications against actively malicious servers is challenging and still unsolved.   We conclude with general lessons for the designers of systems that rely on property-preserving or searchable encryption to protect data from untrusted servers.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Cornell University", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Southern California", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Paul Grubbs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grubbs:Paul", "Richard McPherson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McPherson:Richard", "Muhammad Naveed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naveed_0001:Muhammad", "Thomas Ristenpart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ristenpart:Thomas", "Vitaly Shmatikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shmatikov:Vitaly"], "pages": 12}
