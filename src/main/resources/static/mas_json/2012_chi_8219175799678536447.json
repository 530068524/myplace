Yet, the progress made and the key research questions for shape-changing interfaces are rarely analyzed systematically. We review a sample of existing work on shape-changing interfaces to address these shortcomings. We identify eight types of shape that are transformed in various ways to serve both functional and hedonic design purposes. Interaction with shape-changing interfaces is simple and rarely merges input and output. Three questions are discussed based on the review: (a) which design purposes may shape-changing interfaces be used for, (b) which parts of the design space are not well understood, and (c) why studying user experience with shape-changing interfaces is important.", "citation": "Citations (206)", "departments": ["Aarhus School of Architecture", "University of Copenhagen", "Aarhus University", "University of Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Majken Kirkegaard Rasmussen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rasmussen:Majken_Kirkegaard", "Esben Warming Pedersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedersen:Esben_Warming", "Marianne Graves Petersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petersen:Marianne_Graves", "Kasper Hornb\u00e6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hornb=aelig=k:Kasper"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
