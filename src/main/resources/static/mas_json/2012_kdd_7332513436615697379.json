Adversarial examples that affect one model often affect another model, even if the two models have different architectures or were trained on different training sets, so long as both models were trained to perform the same task. An attacker may therefore train their own substitute model, craft adversarial examples against the substitute, and transfer them to a victim model, with very little information about the victim. Recent work has further developed a technique that uses the victim model as an oracle to label a synthetic training set for the substitute, so the attacker need not even collect a training set to mount the attack. We extend these recent techniques using reservoir sampling to greatly enhance the efficiency of the training procedure for the substitute model. We introduce new transferability attacks between previously unexplored (substitute, victim) pairs of machine learning model classes, most notably SVMs and decision trees. We demonstrate our attacks on two commercial machine learning classification systems from Amazon (96.19% misclassification rate) and Google (88.94%) using only 800 queries of the victim model, thereby showing that existing machine learning approaches are in general vulnerable to systematic black-box attacks regardless of their structure.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "departments": ["University of Cagliari", "University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of T\u00fcbingen", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Purdue University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Cagliari", "University of Cagliari", "University of Melbourne", "University of Cagliari", "University of Cagliari", "University of Cagliari", "University of Cagliari", "University of Cagliari", "University of Cagliari", "Universit\u00e4t Potsdam"], "authors": ["Yan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yan", "Murat Kantarcioglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kantarcioglu:Murat", "Bhavani M.
