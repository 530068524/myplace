Our results improve the best known running times from quasi-polynomial to polynomial for several problems, including decomposing random overcomplete 3-tensors and learning overcomplete dictionaries with constant relative sparsity. We also give the first robust analysis for decomposing overcomplete 4-tensors in the smoothed analysis model. A key ingredient of our analysis is to establish small spectral gaps in moment matrices derived from solutions to sum-of-squares relaxations. To enable this analysis we augment sum-of-squaresrelaxations with spectral analogs of maximum entropy constraints.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Tengyu Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Tengyu", "Jonathan Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jonathan", "David Steurer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steurer:David"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
