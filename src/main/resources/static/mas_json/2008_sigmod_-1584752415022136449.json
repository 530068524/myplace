To support this approach during maintenance and beta testing phases, we have built an automated framework for testing web-based software that focuses on scalability and evolving the test suite automatically as the application's operational profile changes. This paper reports on the automation of the  replay  and  oracle  components for web applications, which pose issues beyond those in the equivalent testing steps for traditional, stand-alone applications. Concurrency, nondeterminism, dependence on persistent state and previous user sessions, a complex application infrastructure, and a large number of output formats necessitate developing different replay and oracle comparator operators, which have tradeoffs in fault detection effectiveness, precision of analysis, and efficiency. We have designed, implemented, and evaluated a set of automated replay techniques and oracle comparators for user-session-based testing of web applications. This paper describes the issues, algorithms, heuristics, and an experimental case study with user sessions for two web applications. From our results, we conclude that testers performing user-session-based testing should consider their expectations for program coverage and fault detection when choosing a replay and oracle technique.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Delaware", "University of Delaware", "University of Delaware", "University of Delaware", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Leonidas Galanis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galanis:Leonidas", "Supiti Buranawatanachoke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buranawatanachoke:Supiti", "Romain Colle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colle:Romain", "Beno\u00eet Dageville.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dageville:Beno=icirc=t", "Karl Dias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dias:Karl", "Jonathan Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Jonathan", "Stratos Papadomanolakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papadomanolakis:Stratos", "Leng Leng Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Leng_Leng", "Venkateshwaran Venkataramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkataramani:Venkateshwaran", "Yujun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yujun", "Graham Wood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wood:Graham"], "pages": 12}
