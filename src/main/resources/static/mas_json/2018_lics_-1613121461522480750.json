An infinity group is simply the loops in a pointed, connected type, where the group structure comes from the structure inherent in the identity types of Martin-Lof type theory. We investigate ordinary groups from this viewpoint, as well as higher dimensional groups and groups that can be delooped more than once. A major result is the stabilization theorem, which states that if an n-type can be delooped n + 2 times, then it is an infinite loop type. Most of the results have been formalized in the Lean proof assistant.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Ulrik Buchholtz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buchholtz:Ulrik", "Floris van Doorn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doorn:Floris_van", "Egbert Rijke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rijke:Egbert"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
