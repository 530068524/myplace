In this paper, we analyze a flexible stochastic process model, the  generalized linear auto-regressive process  (GLARP) and identify the conditions under which the impact of hidden variables appears as an additive term to the evolution matrix estimated with the maximum likelihood. In particular, we examine three examples, including two popular models for count data, i.e, Poisson and Conwey-Maxwell Poisson vector auto-regressive processes, and one powerful model for extreme value data, i.e., Gumbel vector auto-regressive processes. We demonstrate that the impact of hidden factors can be separated out via convex optimization in these three models. We also propose a fast greedy algorithm based on the selection of  composite atoms  in each iteration and provide a performance guarantee for it. Experiments on two synthetic datasets, one social network dataset and one climatology dataset demonstrate the the superior performance of our proposed models.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Mohammad Taha Bahadori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bahadori:Mohammad_Taha", "Yan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Yan", "Eric P.
