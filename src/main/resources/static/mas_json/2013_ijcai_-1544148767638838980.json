{"title": "Fair LTL Synthesis for Non-Deterministic Systems using Strong Cyclic Planners.", "fields": ["successor cardinal", "reachability", "nondeterministic algorithm", "buchi automaton", "observable"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of planning in environments where the state is fully observable, actions have non-deterministic effects, and plans must generate infinite state trajectories for achieving a large class of LTL goals. More formally, we focus on the control synthesis problem under the assumption that the LTL formula to be realized can be mapped into a deterministic Buchi automaton. We show that by assuming that action nondeterminism is fair, namely that infinite executions of a nondeterministic action in the same state yield each possible successor state an infinite number of times, the (fair) synthesis problem can be reduced to a standard strong cyclic planning task over reachability goals. Since strong cyclic planners are built on top of efficient classical planners, the transformation reduces the non-deterministic, fully observable, temporally extended planning task into the solution of classical planning problems. A number of experiments are reported showing the potential benefits of this approach to synthesis in comparison with state-of-the-art symbolic methods.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "University of Melbourne", "ICREA & Univ.
