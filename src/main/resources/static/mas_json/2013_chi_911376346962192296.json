This paper introduces PLACE, an iterative, mixed-fidelity approach to Prototyping Location, Activities, Collective experience, and Experience over time in LBAGs. PLACE consists of 6 design principles: start small and scale up the fidelity, treat participants as co-designers, test in a representative space, focus on activities more than interfaces, respect authentic social experience, and represent time authentically. The effectiveness of PLACE was evaluated by prototyping Floracaching, a geocaching game for citizen science. This revealed the types of insights that PLACE provides, best practices for implementing PLACE, and how PLACE com-pares to other prototyping methods.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Brigham Young University", "Brigham Young University", "Brigham Young University", "Brigham Young University"], "authors": ["Anne Bowser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bowser:Anne", "Derek L.
