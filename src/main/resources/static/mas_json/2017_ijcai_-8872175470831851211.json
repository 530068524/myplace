{"title": "A Novel Symbolic Approach to Verifying Epistemic Properties of Programs.", "fields": ["threeballot", "voting", "correctness", "dining cryptographers problem", "the symbolic"], "abstract": "We introduce a framework for the symbolic verification\nof epistemic properties of programs expressed\nin a class of general-purpose programming\nlanguages. To this end, we reduce the verification\nproblem to that of satisfiability of first-order formulae\nin appropriate theories. We prove the correctness\nof our reduction and we validate our proposal\nby applying it to two examples: the dining\ncryptographers problem and the ThreeBallot voting\nprotocol. We put forward an implementation\nusing existing solvers, and report experimental results\nshowing that the approach can perform better\nthan state-of-the-art symbolic model checkers for\ntemporal-epistemic logic.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Middlesex University", "Middlesex University"], "authors": ["Nikos Gorogiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorogiannis:Nikos", "Franco Raimondi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raimondi:Franco", "Ioana Boureanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boureanu:Ioana"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
