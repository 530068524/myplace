Currently, control on NFs is isolated from the SDN, which creates routing inflexibility, flow imbalance and choke points in the network as the controller remains oblivious to the number, capacity and placement of NFs. Moreover, a NF may modify packets in the middle, which makes flow identification at a SDN switch challenging. In this paper, we postulate native NFs within the SDN data plane, where the same logical controller controls both network services and routing. This is enabled by extending SDN to support stateful flow handling based on higher layers in the packet beyond layers 2\u20134. As a result, NF instances can be chained on demand, directly on the data plane. We present an implementation of this architecture based on Open vSwitch, and show that it enables popular NFs effectively using detailed evaluation and comparison with other alternative solutions.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Hesham Mekky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mekky:Hesham", "Fang Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Fang", "Sarit Mukherjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukherjee:Sarit", "T.
