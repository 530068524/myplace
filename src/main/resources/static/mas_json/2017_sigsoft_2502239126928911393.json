{"title": "Natural language querying in SAP-ERP platform.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "natural language programming", "natural language user interface", "universal networking language", "data control language"], "abstract": "With the omnipresence of mobile devices coupled with recent advances in automatic speech recognition capabilities, there has been a growing demand for natural language query (NLQ) interface to retrieve information from the knowledge bases. Business users particularly find this useful as NLQ interface enables them to ask questions without the knowledge of the query language or the data schema. In this paper, we apply an existing research technology called ``ATHENA: An Ontology-Driven System for Natural Language Querying over Relational Data Stores'' in the industry domain of SAP-ERP systems. The goal is to enable users to query SAP-ERP data using natural language. We present the challenges and their solutions of such a technology transfer. We present the effectiveness of the natural language query interface on a set of questions given by a set of SAP practitioners.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Diptikalyan Saha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saha:Diptikalyan", "Neelamadhav Gantayat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gantayat:Neelamadhav", "Senthil Mani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mani:Senthil", "Barry Mitchell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitchell:Barry"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
