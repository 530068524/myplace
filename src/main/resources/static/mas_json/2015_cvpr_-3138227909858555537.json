We first improve the label likelihood estimates at superpixels by merging likelihood scores from different probabilistic classifiers. This boosts the classification performance and enriches the representation of less-represented classes. Our second contribution consists of incorporating semantic context in the parsing process through global label costs. Our method does not rely on image retrieval sets but rather assigns a global likelihood estimate to each label, which is plugged into the overall energy function. We evaluate our system on two large-scale datasets, SIFTflow and LMSun. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SIFTflow dataset and near-record results on LMSun.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Marian George.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/George:Marian"], "pages": 9}
