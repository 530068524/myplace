Despite its simplicity, popularity and excellent performance, the component does not explicitly encourage discriminative learning of features. In this paper, we propose a generalized large-margin softmax (L-Softmax) loss which explicitly encourages intra-class compactness and inter-class separability between learned features. Moreover, L-Softmax not only can adjust the desired margin but also can avoid overfitting. We also show that the L-Softmax loss can be optimized by typical stochastic gradient descent. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the deeply-learned features with L-softmax loss become more discriminative, hence significantly boosting the performance on a variety of visual classification and verification tasks.", "citation": "Citations (110)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Peking University", "South China University of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Shenzhen University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Weiyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Weiyang", "Yandong Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Yandong", "Zhiding Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Zhiding", "Meng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Meng"], "pages": 10}
