This minimization problem is another approach to the problem of preventing the spread of contamination by removing nodes in a network. We propose a method for efficiently finding a good approximate solution to this problem based on a naturally greedy strategy. Using large real networks, we demonstrate experimentally that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional link-removal methods. We also show that unlike the strategy of removing nodes, blocking links between nodes with high out-degrees is not necessarily effective.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Ryukoku University", "University of Shizuoka", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Masahiro Kimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimura:Masahiro", "Kazumi Saito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saito:Kazumi", "Hiroshi Motoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Motoda:Hiroshi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
