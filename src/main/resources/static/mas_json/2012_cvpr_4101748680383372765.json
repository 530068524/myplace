In the cosegmentation context, on the other hand, the availability of multiple images assumed to contain instances of the same object classes provides a weak form of supervision that can be exploited by discriminative approaches. Unfortunately, most existing algorithms are limited to a very small number of images and/or object classes (typically two of each). This paper proposes a novel energy-minimization approach to cosegmentation that can handle multiple classes and a significantly larger number of images. The proposed cost function combines spectral- and discriminative-clustering terms, and it admits a probabilistic interpretation. It is optimized using an efficient EM method, initialized using a convex quadratic approximation of the energy. Comparative experiments show that the proposed approach matches or improves the state of the art on several standard datasets.", "citation": "Citations (243)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Armand Joulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joulin:Armand", "Francis R.
