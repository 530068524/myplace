However, existing sampling methods are limited by their accuracies and computing times. This paper proposes a scalable Nystrom-based clustering algorithm with a new sampling procedure, Minimum Sum of Squared Similarities (MSSS). Here we provide a theoretical analysis of the upper error bound of our algorithm, and demonstrate its performance in comparison to the leading spectral clustering methods that use Nystrom sampling.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Canada's Michae ... lumbia, Canada", "Canada's Michae ... lumbia, Canada"], "authors": ["Djallel Bouneffouf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bouneffouf:Djallel", "Inan\u00e7 Birol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Birol:Inan=ccedil="], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
