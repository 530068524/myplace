We introduce a principled, flexible, and practical technique for augmenting delete-relaxed tasks with a limited amount of delete information, by introducing special fluents that explicitly represent conjunctions of fluents in the original planning task. Differently from previous work, conditional effects are used to limit the growth of the task to be linear in the number of such conjunctions, making its use for obtaining heuristic functions feasible. The resulting heuristics are empirically evaluated, and shown to be sometimes much more informative than standard delete-relaxation heuristics.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Saarland University", "Australian National University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Saarland University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Emil Ragip Keyder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keyder:Emil_Ragip", "J\u00f6rg Hoffmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoffmann_0001:J=ouml=rg", "Patrik Haslum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haslum:Patrik"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
