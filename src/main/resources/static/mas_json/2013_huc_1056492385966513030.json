The resulting system, called OurTravel, was the subject of a series of real-world trials involving three diverse physical communities: a rural village, a group of urban office workers and the attendees of a contemporary arts festival. We describe the design and implementation of the OurTravel system, our experiences of running these trials and the insights gained.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "InTouch Ltd, La ...
