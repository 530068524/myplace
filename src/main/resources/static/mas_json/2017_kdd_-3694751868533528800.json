This network discovery problem naturally exists in a multitude of domains including climate data (dipoles), astronomical data (gravitational lensing) and the focus of this paper, fMRI scans of human subjects. Whereas previous work requires strong supervision, we propose an unsupervised matrix tri-factorization formulation with complex constraints and spatial regularization. We show that this formulation works well in controlled experiments with synthetic networks and is able to recover the underlying ground-truth network. We then show that for real fMRI data our approach can reproduce well known results in neurology regarding the default mode network in resting-state healthy and Alzheimer affected individuals.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "Naval Medical Research Center", "Naval Medical Research Center", "Cornell University", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Zilong Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Zilong", "Peter B.
