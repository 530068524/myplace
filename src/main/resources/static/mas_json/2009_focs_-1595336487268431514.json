In fact, our proof shows that this market-equilibrium problem does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme, unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Tsinghua University", "University of Michigan", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Xi", "Decheng Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Decheng", "Ye Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Ye", "Shang-Hua Teng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teng:Shang=Hua"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
