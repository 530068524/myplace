{"title": "HAWKEYE: effective discovery of dataflow impediments to parallelization.", "fields": ["dependence analysis", "bottleneck", "correctness", "software system", "automatic parallelization"], "abstract": "Parallelization transformations are an important vehicle for improving the performance and scalability of a software system. Utilizing concurrency requires that the developer first identify a suitable parallelization scope: one that poses as a performance bottleneck, and at the same time, exhibits considerable available parallelism. However, having identified a candidate scope, the developer still needs to ensure the correctness of the transformation. This is a difficult undertaking, where a major source of complication lies in tracking down sequential dependencies that inhibit parallelization and addressing them.   We report on Hawkeye, a dynamic dependence-analysis tool that is designed to assist programmers in pinpointing such impediments to parallelization. In contrast with field-based dependence analyses, which track concrete memory conflicts and thus suffer from a high rate of false reports, Hawkeye tracks dependencies induced by the abstract semantics of the data type while ignoring dependencing arising solely from implementation artifacts. This enables a more concise report, where the reported dependencies are more likely to be real as well as intelligible to the programmer.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Google", "Tel Aviv University", "ARM, Cambridge, United Kingdom"], "authors": ["Omer Tripp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tripp:Omer", "Greta Yorsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yorsh:Greta", "John Field.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Field:John", "Mooly Sagiv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sagiv:Mooly"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2011", "pages": 18}
