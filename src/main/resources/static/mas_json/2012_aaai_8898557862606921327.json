In the symmetric version of this problem, the robots are required to execute the same strategy. First, we present a symmetric rendezvous strategy for the robots that are initially placed on the open plane and analyze its competitive performance. We show that the competitive complexity of our strategy is O(d=R) where d is the initial distance between the robots and R is the communication radius. Second, we extend the symmetric rendezvous strategy for the open plane to unknown environments with polygonal obstacles. The extended strategy guarantees a complete coverage of the environment. We analyze the strategy for square, translating robots and show that the competitive ratio of the extended strategy is O(d=D) where D is the length of the sides of the robots. In obtaining this result, we also obtain an upper bound on covering arbitrary polygonal environments which may be of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["\u0130zmir University", "University of Minnesota", "Department of M ...
