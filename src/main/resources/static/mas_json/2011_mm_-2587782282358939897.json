Orcc provides a set of open-source software tools for managing decoders standardized within MPEG by the Reconfigurable Video Coding (RVC) experts. In this framework, Jade acts as a Virtual Machine for any decoder description that uses the MPEG RVC paradigm. Jade dynamically generates a native decoder representation suitable for X86, ARM and CELL platforms with a possibility of exploiting multi-core CPUs. Thus, according to the MPEG RVC decoder description coupled with a video coded stream, Jade can create, configure and re-configure video decompression algorithms adapting to the video content.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Telecom SudParis", "University of Rennes", "Mines ParisTech", "Intelligence and National Security Alliance"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Gorin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorin:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Herv\u00e9 Yviquel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yviquel:Herv=eacute=", "Fran\u00e7oise J.
