{"title": "Text Segmentation by Language Using Minimum Description Length.", "fields": ["minimum description length", "human rights", "dynamic programming", "text segmentation", "declaration"], "abstract": "The problem addressed in this paper is to segment a given multilingual document into segments for each language and then identify the language of each segment. The problem was motivated by an attempt to collect a large amount of linguistic data for non-major languages from the web. The problem is formulated in terms of obtaining the minimum description length of a text, and the proposed solution finds the segments and their languages through dynamic programming. Empirical results demonstrating the potential of this approach are presented for experiments using texts taken from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Wikipedia, covering more than 200 languages.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Kyushu University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hiroshi Yamaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamaguchi:Hiroshi", "Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanaka=Ishii:Kumiko"], "pages": 10}
