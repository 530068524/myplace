{"title": "Revisiting reachability in timed automata.", "fields": ["timed automaton", "reachability", "parametric statistics", "integer", "binary number"], "abstract": "We revisit a fundamental result in real-time verification, namely that the binary reachability relation between configurations of a given timed automaton is definable in linear arithmetic over the integers and reals. In this paper we give a new and simpler proof of this result, building on the well-known reachability analysis of timed automata involving difference bound matrices. Using this new proof, we give an exponential-space procedure for model checking the reachability fragment of the logic parametric TCTL. Finally we show that the latter problem is NEXPTIME-hard.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Leipzig University", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Karin Quaas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quaas:Karin", "Mahsa Shirmohammadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shirmohammadi:Mahsa", "James Worrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Worrell_0001:James"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
