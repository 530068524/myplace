{"title": "Effective Bilingual Constraints for Semi-Supervised Learning of Named Entity Recognizers.", "fields": ["semi supervised learning", "named entity", "approximate inference", "utterance", "named entity recognition"], "abstract": "Most semi-supervised methods in Natural Language Processing capitalize on unannotated resources in a single language; however, information can be gained from using parallel resources in more than one language, since translations of the same utterance in different languages can help to disambiguate each other. We demonstrate a method that makes effective use of vast amounts of bilingual text (a.k.a. bitext) to improve monolingual systems. We propose a factored probabilistic sequence model that encourages both cross-language and intra-document consistency. A simple Gibbs sampling algorithm is introduced for performing approximate inference. Experiments on English-Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the OntoNotes dataset demonstrate that our method is significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art monolingual CRF models in a bilingual test setting. Our model also improves on previous work by Burkett et al. (2010), achieving a relative error reduction of 10.8% and 4.5% in Chinese and English, respectively. Furthermore, by annotating a moderate amount of unlabeled bi-text with our bilingual model, and using the tagged data for uptraining, we achieve a 9.2% error reduction in Chinese over the state-of-the-art Stanford monolingual NER system.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Mengqiu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Mengqiu", "Wanxiang Che.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Che:Wanxiang", "Christopher D.
