{"title": "New Proof Methods for Attribute-Based Encryption: Achieving Full Security through Selective Techniques.", "fields": ["random oracle", "probabilistic encryption", "attribute based encryption", "functional encryption", "access structure"], "abstract": "We develop a new methodology for utilizing the prior techniques to prove selective security for functional encryption systems as a direct ingredient in devising proofs of full security. This deepens the relationship between the selective and full security models and provides a path for transferring the best qualities of selectively secure systems to fully secure systems. In particular, we present a Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption scheme that is proven fully secure while matching the efficiency of the state of the art selectively secure systems.", "citation": "Citations (251)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Allison B.
