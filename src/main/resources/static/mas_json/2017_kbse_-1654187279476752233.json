{"title": "Learn&Fuzz: machine learning for input fuzzing.", "fields": ["deep learning", "fuzz testing", "probability distribution", "recurrent neural network", "parsing"], "abstract": "Fuzzing consists of repeatedly testing an application with modified, or fuzzed, inputs with the goal of finding security vulnerabilities in input-parsing code. In this paper, we show how to automate the generation of an input grammar suitable for input fuzzing using sample inputs and neural-network-based statistical machine-learning techniques. We present a detailed case study with a complex input format, namely PDF, and a large complex security-critical parser for this format, namely, the PDF parser embedded in Microsoft's new Edge browser. We discuss and measure the tension between conflicting learning and fuzzing goals: learning wants to capture the structure of well-formed inputs, while fuzzing wants to break that structure in order to cover unexpected code paths and find bugs. We also present a new algorithm for this learn&fuzz challenge which uses a learnt input probability distribution to intelligently guide where to fuzz inputs.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Patrice Godefroid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Godefroid:Patrice", "Hila Peleg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peleg:Hila", "Rishabh Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Rishabh"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
