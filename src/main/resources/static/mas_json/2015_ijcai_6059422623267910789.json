{"title": "Optimal Route Search with the Coverage of Users' Preferences.", "fields": ["data mining", "machine learning", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "admissible heuristic"], "abstract": "The preferences of users are important in route search and planning. For example, when a user plans a trip within a city, their preferences can be expressed as keywords shopping mall, restaurant, and museum, with weights 0.5, 0.4, and 0.1, respectively. The resulting route should best satisfy their weighted preferences. In this paper, we take into account the weighted user preferences in route search, and present a keyword coverage problem, which finds an optimal route from a source location to a target location such that the keyword coverage is optimized and that the budget score satisfies a specified constraint. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. To solve this complex problem, we propose an optimal route search based on an A* variant for which we have defined an admissible heuristic function. The experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate both the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Teesside University", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Queen's University Belfast", "Teesside University", "Teesside University"], "authors": ["Yifeng Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Yifeng", "Xuefeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xuefeng", "Xin Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xin", "Shengchao Qin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qin:Shengchao", "Marc Cavazza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cavazza:Marc", "Yanping Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Yanping"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
