{"title": "Verified Proofs of Higher-Order Masking.", "fields": ["theoretical computer science", "countermeasure", "exponential function", "mathematical proof", "masking"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of automatically verifying higher-order masking countermeasures. This problem is important in practice, since weaknesses have been discovered in schemes that were thought secure, but is inherently exponential: for \\(t\\)-order masking, it involves proving that every subset of \\(t\\) intermediate variables is distributed independently of the secrets. Some tools have been proposed to help cryptographers check their proofs, but are often limited in scope.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["IMDEA", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "IMDEA", "Institut Universitaire de France", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Gilles Barthe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthe:Gilles", "Sonia Bela\u00efd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bela=iuml=d:Sonia", "Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dupressoir:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Pierre-Alain Fouque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fouque:Pierre=Alain", "Benjamin Gr\u00e9goire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=eacute=goire:Benjamin", "Pierre-Yves Strub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strub:Pierre=Yves"], "pages": 29}
