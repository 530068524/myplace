Due to their importance, a significant amount of attention has been given to understanding and improving both proofs and attacks against such schemes. At EUROCRYPT 2005, Bernstein published the best known analysis of the schemes when instantiated with PRPs, thereby establishing the most lenient limits on the amount of data the schemes can process per key. A long line of work, initiated by Handschuh and Preneel at CRYPTO 2008, finds the best known attacks, advancing our understanding of the fragility of the schemes. Yet surprisingly, no known attacks perform as well as the predicted worst-case attacks allowed by Bernstein\u2019s analysis, nor has there been any advancement in proofs improving Bernstein\u2019s bounds, and the gap between attacks and analysis is significant. We settle the issue by finding a novel attack against polynomial-based authentication algorithms using PRPs, and combine it with new analysis, to show that Bernstein\u2019s bound, and our attacks, are optimal.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Visa Research, Palo Alto, USA"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Atul Luykx.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luykx:Atul", "Bart Preneel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Preneel:Bart"], "pages": 23}
