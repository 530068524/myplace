{"title": "Metadata-Aware Measures for Answer Summarization in Community Question Answering.", "fields": ["question answering", "exploit", "rouge", "automatic summarization", "user generated content"], "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for automatically processing information coming from community Question Answering (cQA) portals with the purpose of generating a trustful, complete, relevant and succinct summary in response to a question. We exploit the metadata intrinsically present in User Generated Content (UGC) to bias automatic multi-document summarization techniques toward high quality information. We adopt a representation of concepts alternative to n-grams and propose two concept-scoring functions based on semantic overlap. Experimental results on data drawn from Yahoo! Answers demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of ROUGE scores. We show that the information contained in the best answers voted by users of cQA portals can be successfully complemented by our method.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mattia Tomasoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomasoni:Mattia", "Minlie Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Minlie"], "pages": 10}
