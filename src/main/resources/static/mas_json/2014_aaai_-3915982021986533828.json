In this study we analyze the check-in patterns in LBSN and observe significant temporal clustering of check-in activities. We explore how self-reinforcing behaviors, social factors, and exogenous effects contribute to this clustering and introduce a framework to distinguish these effects at the level of individual check-ins for both users and venues. Using check-in data from three major cities, we show not only that our model can improve prediction of future check-ins, but also that disentangling of different factors allows us to infer meaningful properties of different venues", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Information Sciences Institute", "Information Sciences Institute", "Information Sciences Institute"], "authors": ["Yoon-Sik Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Yoon=Sik", "Greg Ver Steeg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steeg:Greg_Ver", "Aram Galstyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galstyan:Aram"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
