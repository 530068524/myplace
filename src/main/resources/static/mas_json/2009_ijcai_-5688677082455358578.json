Our method extends the perceptron algorithm for the learning task with latent dependencies, which may not be captured by traditional models. It relies on Viterbi decoding over latent variables, combined with simple additive updates. Compared to existing probabilistic models of latent variables, our method lowers the training cost significantly yet with comparable or even superior classification accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Manchester"], "authors": ["Xu Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Xu", "Takuya Matsuzaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsuzaki:Takuya", "Daisuke Okanohara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okanohara:Daisuke", "Jun'ichi Tsujii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsujii:Jun=ichi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 7}
