{"title": "Learning Defining Features for Categories.", "fields": ["distributed file system", "categorization", "feature learning", "cognition", "bootstrapping"], "abstract": "Categories play a fundamental role in human cognition. Defining features (short for DFs) are the key elements to define a category, which enables machines to categorize objects. Categories enriched with their DFs significantly improve the machine's ability of categorization and benefit many applications built upon categorization. However, defining features can rarely be found for categories in current knowledge bases. Traditional efforts such as manual construction by domain experts are not practical to find defining features for millions of categories. In this paper, we make the first attempt to automatically find defining features for millions of categories in the real world. We formalize the defining feature learning problem and propose a bootstrapping solution to learn defining features from the features of entities belonging to a category. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Finally, we find defining features for overall 60,247 categories with acceptable accuracy.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Facebook"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Bo Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Bo", "Chenhao Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Chenhao", "Yi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yi", "Yanghua Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Yanghua", "Haixun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haixun", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0009:Wei"], "pages": 7}
