{"title": "Generating Event Causality Hypotheses through Semantic Relations.", "fields": ["causality", "machine learning", "natural language processing", "noun", "natural language understanding"], "abstract": "Event causality knowledge is indispensable for intelligent natural language understanding. The problem is that any method for extracting event causalities from text is insufficient; it is likely that some event causalities that we can recognize in this world are not written in a corpus, no matter its size. We propose a method of hypothesizing unseen event causalities from known event causalities extracted from the web by the semantic relations between nouns. For example, our method can hypothesize deploy a security camera\u2192avoid crimes from deploy a mosquito net\u2192avoid malaria through semantic relation A PREVENTS B. Our experiments show that, from 2.4 million event causalities extracted from the web, our method generated more than 300,000 hypotheses, which were not in the input, with 70% precision. We also show that our method outperforms a state-of-the-art hypothesis generation method.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology", "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"], "authors": ["Chikara Hashimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hashimoto:Chikara", "Kentaro Torisawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torisawa:Kentaro", "Julien Kloetzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kloetzer:Julien", "Jong-Hoon Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Jong=Hoon"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
