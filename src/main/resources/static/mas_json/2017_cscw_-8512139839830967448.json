{"title": "Huddler: Convening Stable and Familiar Crowd Teams Despite Unpredictable Availability.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "knowledge management", "software deployment", "field experiment", "workflow"], "abstract": "Distributed, parallel crowd workers can accomplish simple tasks through workflows, but teams of collaborating crowd workers are necessary for complex goals. Unfortunately, a fundamental condition for effective teams -- familiarity with other members -- stands in contrast to crowd work's flexible, on-demand nature. We enable effective crowd teams with Huddler, a system for workers to assemble familiar teams even under unpredictable availability and strict time constraints. Huddler utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize for highly familiar teammates when individual availability is unknown. We first present a field experiment that demonstrates the value of familiarity for crowd teams: familiar crowd teams doubled the performance of ad-hoc (unfamiliar) teams on a collaborative task. We then report a two-week field deployment wherein Huddler enabled crowd workers to convene highly familiar teams in 18 minutes on average. This research advances the goal of supporting long-term, team-based collaborations without sacrificing the flexibility of crowd work.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Niloufar Salehi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salehi:Niloufar", "Andrew McCabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCabe:Andrew", "Melissa A.
