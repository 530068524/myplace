These techniques have applications in tagging content on screens similar to QR-code tagging for other objects. This paper characterizes the design space for flicker-free embedded screen-camera communication. In particular, we identify an orthogonal dimension to prior work: spatial content-adaptive encoding, and observe that it is essential to combine multiple dimensions to achieve both high capacity and minimal flicker. From these insights, we develop content-adaptive encoding techniques that exploit visual features such as edges and texture to unobtrusively communicate information. These can then be layered over existing techniques to further boost the capacity. Our experimental results show that there is potential to achieve an average goodput of about 22 kbps, significantly outperforming existing work while remaining flicker-free.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Carnergie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Viet Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Viet", "Yaqin Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Yaqin", "Ashwin Ashok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ashok:Ashwin", "Marco Gruteser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gruteser:Marco", "Kristin J.
