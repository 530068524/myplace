To this end, we give three conditions for its tractability. Let F be any finite set of complex-valued functions. We show that #CSP(F) is solvable in polynomial time if all three conditions are satisfied; and is #P-hard otherwise. Our dichotomy theorem generalizes a long series of important results on counting problems: (a) the problem of counting graph homomorphisms is the special case when F has a single symmetric binary function; (b) the problem of counting directed graph homomorphisms is the special case when F has a single but not-necessarily-symmetric binary function; and (c) the unweighted form of #CSP is when all functions in F take values in {0,1}.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Columbia University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Columbia University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Jin-Yi Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Jin=Yi", "Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Xi"], "pages": 12}
