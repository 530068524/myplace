{"title": "Non-convex Robust PCA.", "fields": ["regular polygon", "matrix", "scalability", "sparse matrix", "relaxation"], "abstract": "We propose a new provable method for robust PCA, where the task is to recover a low-rank matrix, which is corrupted with sparse perturbations. Our method consists of simple alternating projections onto the set of low rank and sparse matrices with intermediate de-noising steps. We prove correct recovery of the low rank and sparse components under tight recovery conditions, which match those for the state-of-art convex relaxation techniques. Our method is extremely simple to implement and has low computational complexity. For a $m \\times n$ input matrix (say m \\geq n), our method has O(r^2 mn\\log(1/\\epsilon)) running time, where $r$ is the rank of the low-rank component and $\\epsilon$ is the accuracy. In contrast, the convex relaxation methods have a running time O(mn^2/\\epsilon), which is not scalable to large problem instances. Our running time nearly matches that of the usual PCA (i.e. non robust), which is O(rmn\\log (1/\\epsilon)). Thus, we achieve ``best of both the worlds'', viz low computational complexity and provable recovery for robust PCA. Our analysis represents one of the few instances of global convergence guarantees for non-convex methods.", "citation": "Citations (149)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, Irvine", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Praneeth Netrapalli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Netrapalli:Praneeth", "U.
