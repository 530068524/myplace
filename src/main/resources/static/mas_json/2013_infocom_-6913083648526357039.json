{"title": "Is link signature dependable for wireless security?", "fields": ["adversary", "correlation attack", "wireless security", "fixed wireless", "exploit"], "abstract": "A fundamental assumption of link signature based security mechanisms is that the wireless signals received at two locations separated by more than half a wavelength are essentially uncorrelated. However, it has been observed that in certain circumstances (e.g., with poor scattering and/or a strong line-of-sight (LOS) component), this assumption is invalid. In this paper, a Correlation ATtack (CAT) is proposed to demonstrate the potential vulnerability of the link signature based security mechanisms in such circumstances. Based on statistical inference, CAT explicitly exploits the spatial correlations to reconstruct the legitimate link signature from the observations of multiple adversary receivers deployed in vicinity. Our findings are verified through theoretical analysis, well-known channel correlation models, and experiments on USRP platforms and GNURadio.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Xiaofan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaofan", "Huaiyu Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Huaiyu", "Wenbo Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Wenbo", "Peng Ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ning:Peng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
