{"title": "The Datacatcher: Batch Deployment and Documentation of 130 Location-Aware, Mobile Devices That Put Sociopolitically-Relevant Big Data in People's Hands: Polyphonic Interpretation at Scale.", "fields": ["big data", "polyphony", "software deployment", "bespoke", "service design"], "abstract": "This paper reports the results of a field trial of 130 bespoke devices as well as our methodological approach to the undertaking. Datacatchers are custom-built, location-aware devices that stream messages about the area they are in. Derived from a large number of 'big data' sources, the messages simultaneously draw attention to the socio-political topology of the lived environment and to the nature of big data itself. We used a service design consultancy to deploy the devices, and two teams of documentary filmmakers to capture participants' experiences. Here we discuss the development of this approach and how people responded to the Datacatchers as products, as revealing sociopolitical issues, and as purveyors of big data that might be open to question.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Goldsmiths, University of London", "Goldsmiths, University of London", "Goldsmiths, University of London", "Goldsmiths, University of London", "Goldsmiths, University of London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["William W.
