Whilst an eighty-year-old in the UK is predicted on average to live at least another ten years, cheques may not. Despite many older peoples extensive use of cheques, UK banks are eager to abolish them and design electronic alternatives that are less costly to process and less vulnerable to fraud. This paper reports on two qualitative studies that explored the banking experiences of 23 people over eighty years old. Cheques support financial collaboration with others in ways that digital payment systems do not. We argue that whilst it might be possible to improve the design of digital payment systems to better support financial collaboration, the case for retaining and enhancing cheques is stronger. Rather than replace cheques, we must design ways of making them less costly to process and better linked to electronic payment methods.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Northumbria University", "Newcastle University", "Northumbria University", "Newcastle University", "University of York"], "authors": ["John Vines.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vines:John", "Paul Dunphy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunphy:Paul", "Mark Blythe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blythe:Mark", "Stephen Lindsay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindsay:Stephen", "Andrew Monk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monk:Andrew", "Patrick Olivier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olivier:Patrick"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
