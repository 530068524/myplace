The literature provides a great deal of powerful statistical learning algorithms to gain knowledge on the underlying distribution given multivariate observations. We are likely to find out a dependence between features, the appearance of clusters or the presence of outliers. Before such deep investigations, we propose the folding test of unimodality. As a simple statistical description, it allows to detect whether data are gathered or not (unimodal or multimodal). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multivariate and purely statistical unimodality test. It makes no distribution assumption and relies only on a straightforward p-value. Through real world data experiments, we show its relevance and how it could be useful for clustering.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Agrocampus Ouest"], "authors": ["Alban Siffer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siffer:Alban", "Pierre-Alain Fouque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fouque:Pierre=Alain", "Alexandre Termier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Termier:Alexandre", "Christine Largou\u00ebt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Largou=euml=t:Christine"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
