{"title": "Comparing multi-point stride coverage and dataflow coverage.", "fields": ["dataflow", "stride", "test suite", "data flow analysis", "tuple"], "abstract": "We introduce a family of coverage criteria, called Multi-Point Stride Coverage (MPSC). MPSC generalizes branch coverage to coverage of tuples of branches taken from the execution sequence of a program. We investigate its potential as a replacement for dataflow coverage, such as def-use coverage. We find that programs can be instrumented for MPSC easily, that the instrumentation usually incurs less overhead than that for def-use coverage, and that MPSC is comparable in usefulness to def-use in predicting test suite effectiveness. We also find that the space required to collect MPSC can be predicted from the number of branches in the program.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Western Ontario", "University of Western Ontario"], "authors": ["Mohammad Mahdi Hassan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassan:Mohammad_Mahdi", "James H.
