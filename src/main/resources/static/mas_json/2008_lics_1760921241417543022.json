These automata generalise pushdown automata by the use of higher-order stacks, which are nested \"stack of stacks\" structures. Representing higher-order stacks as well-bracketed words in the usual way, we show that the winning regions of these games are regular sets of words. Moreover a finite automaton recognising this region can be effectively computed. A novelty of our work are abstract pushdown processes which can be seen as (ordinary) pushdown automata but with an infinite stack alphabet. We use the device to give a uniform presentation of our results.From our main result on winning regions of parity games we derive a solution to the Modal Mu-Calculus Global Model-Checking Problem for higher-order pushdown graphs as well as for ranked trees generated by higher-order safe recursion schemes.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Oxford", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University", "University of Oxford", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University"], "authors": ["Arnaud Carayol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carayol:Arnaud", "Matthew Hague.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hague:Matthew", "Antoine Meyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyer:Antoine", "C.-H.
