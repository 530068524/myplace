{"title": "Finding Diverse Solutions of High Quality to Constraint Optimization Problems.", "fields": ["management science", "mathematical optimization", "computer science", "constrained optimization"], "abstract": "A number of effective techniques for constraint-based optimization can be used to generate either diverse or high-quality solutions independently, but no framework is devoted to accomplish both simultaneously. In this paper, we tackle this issue with a generic paradigm that can be implemented in most existing solvers. We show that our technique can be specialized to produce diverse solutions of high quality in the context of over-constrained problems. Furthermore, our paradigm allows us to consider diversity from a different point of view, based on generic concepts expressed by global constraints.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"], "authors": ["Thierry Petit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petit:Thierry", "Andrew C.
