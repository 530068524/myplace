In our research, we found that although a great number of packet classification algorithms have been proposed in recent years, unfortunately most of them stagnate in mathematical analysis or software simulation stages and few of them have been implemented in commercial products as a generic solution. To fill the gap between theory and practice, in this paper, we propose a novel packet classification algorithm named HyperSplit. Compared to the well-known HiCuts and HSM algorithms, HyperSplit achieves superior performance in terms of classification speed, memory usage and preprocessing time. The practicability of the proposed algorithm is manifested by two facts in our test: HyperSplit is the only algorithm that can successfully handle all the rule sets; HyperSplit is also the only algorithm that reaches more than 6Gbps throughput on the Octeon3860 multi-core platform when tested with 64-byte Ethernet packets against 10K ACL rules.", "citation": "Citations (133)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yaxuan Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Yaxuan", "Lianghong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Lianghong", "Baohua Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Baohua", "Yibo Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Yibo", "Jun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Jun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
