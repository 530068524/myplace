{"title": "Surrogate losses and regret bounds for cost-sensitive classification with example-dependent costs.", "fields": ["mathematics", "mathematical optimization", "level set", "regret", "exponential function"], "abstract": "We study surrogate losses in the context of cost-sensitive classification with example-dependent costs, a problem also known as regression level set estimation. We give sufficient conditions on the surrogate loss for the existence of a surrogate regret bound. Such bounds imply that as the surrogate risk tends to its optimal value, so too does the expected misclassification cost. Our sufficient conditions encompass example-dependent versions of the hinge, exponential, and other common losses. These results provide theoretical justification for some previously proposed surrogate-based algorithms, and suggests others that have not yet been developed.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Michigan"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Clayton Scott.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scott:Clayton"], "pages": 8}
