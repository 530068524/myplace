However, a prevalence of P2P applications has caused heavy traffic on the Internet. While P2P streaming users enjoy high-quality online video, the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) may experience large expenditure because of cross-ISP traffic. To reduce this traffic, it has been suggested that ISPs cooperate with P2P systems by exposing information about the networking layer to guide the topology construction. In this paper, we propose a novel peer selection algorithm that leverages the ISPs' service to form a local clustering topology through gossip communication. Additionally, this algorithm is adaptive to prevent peers from being trapped in a local cluster where they cannot obtain an adequate streaming rate.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Zhijie Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Zhijie", "Roger Zimmermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmermann:Roger"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
