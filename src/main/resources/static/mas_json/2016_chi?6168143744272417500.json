To this end, we review commonly used gamification elements in terms of their suitability for such an approach and present the results of an online questionnaire (N=75) complemented by semi-structured interviews with employees of a manufacturing company (N=8). In a twelve-day-long study (N=20) we investigated the usefulness of a task managing app implementing a \"bottom-up\" gamification concept. With these studies, we derived requirements \"bottom-up\" applications should fulfill. The study results reveal that people want to use such an approach and are open to the creation of their own gamified experience, thus suggesting that \"bottom-up\" can be an alternative to \"top-down\" gamification often used today.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "DFKI GmbH, Saar ... r\u00fccken, Germany"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Pascal Lessel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lessel:Pascal", "Maximilian Altmeyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Altmeyer:Maximilian", "Marc M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Marc", "Christian Wolff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolff:Christian", "Antonio Kr\u00fcger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=uuml=ger:Antonio"], "pages": 12}
