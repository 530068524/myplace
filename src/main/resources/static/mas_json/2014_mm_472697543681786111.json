However, a clear understanding of this effect is important, since accurate models, evaluation methodologies, and metrics for visual attention are essential in many areas, including image and video compression, camera and displays manufacturing, artistic content creation, and advertisement. In this paper, we address this problem by creating a dataset of UHD resolution images with corresponding eye-tracking data, and we show that there is a statistically significant difference between viewing strategies when watching UHD and HD contents. Furthermore, by evaluating five representative computational models of visual saliency, we demonstrate the decrease in models' accuracies on UHD contents when compared to HD contents. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of computational models for higher resolutions, we propose a segmentation-based resolution-adaptive weighting scheme. Our approach demonstrates that taking into account information about resolution of the images improves the performance of computational models.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Hiromi Nemoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nemoto:Hiromi", "Philippe Hanhart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanhart:Philippe", "Pavel Korshunov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korshunov:Pavel", "Touradj Ebrahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ebrahimi:Touradj"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
