Here, we introduce a novel approach enabling kernel methods to utilize additional information hidden in the structural neighborhood of the graphs under consideration. Our novel structural cluster kernel (SCK) incorporates similarities induced by a structural clustering algorithm to improve state-of-the-art graph kernels. The approach taken is based on the idea that graph similarity can not only be described by the similarity between the graphs themselves, but also by the similarity they possess with respect to their structural neighborhood. We applied our novel kernel in a supervised and a semi-supervised setting to regression and classification problems on a number of real-world datasets of molecular graphs.   Our results show that the structural cluster similarity information can indeed leverage the prediction performance of the base kernel, particularly when the dataset is structurally sparse and consequently structurally diverse. By additionally taking into account a large number of unlabeled instances the performance of the structural cluster kernel can further be improved.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Mainz", "University of Mainz"], "authors": ["Madeleine Seeland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seeland:Madeleine", "Andreas Karwath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karwath:Andreas", "Stefan Kramer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kramer_0001:Stefan"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
