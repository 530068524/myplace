To address these problems, we suggest a new interactive learning approach that combines similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking by SVM using local feature distributions. This approach leads to improved sample selection, allowing to obtain better results.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Wajih Ouertani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouertani:Wajih", "Michel Crucianu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crucianu:Michel", "Nozha Boujemaa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boujemaa:Nozha"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
