We investigate how to enter text with devices that are solely enabled with accelerometers. The challenge of text-entry with such devices can be overcome by the careful investigation of the human limitations in gestural movements with accelerometers. Preliminary studies provide insight into two potential text-entry designs that purely use accelerometers for gesture recognition. In two experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of each of the text-entry designs. The first experiment involves novice users over a 45 minute period while the second investigates the possible performance increases over a four day period. Our results reveal that a matrix-based text-entry system with a small set of simple gestures is the most efficient (5.4wpm) and subjectively preferred by participants.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "departments": ["University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol", "University of Manitoba", "University of Bristol"], "authors": ["Eleanor Jones.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jones:Eleanor", "Jason Alexander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alexander:Jason", "Andreas Andreou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andreou:Andreas", "Pourang Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Pourang", "Sriram Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Sriram"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
