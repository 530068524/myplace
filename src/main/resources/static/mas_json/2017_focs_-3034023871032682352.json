{"title": "Short Presburger Arithmetic Is Hard.", "fields": ["bounded function", "presburger arithmetic", "inequality", "linear inequality", "integer"], "abstract": "We study the computational complexity of short sentences in Presburger arithmetic (SHORT-PA). Here by short we mean sentences with a bounded number of variables, quantifiers, inequalities and Boolean operations; the input consists only of the integer coefficients involved in the linear inequalities. We prove that satisfiability of SHORT-PA sentences with m+2 alternating quantifiers is SigmaP_m-complete or PiP_m-complete, when the first quantifier is exists or forall, respectively. Counting versions and restricted systems are also analyzed.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of California", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Danny Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Danny", "Igor Pak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pak:Igor"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
