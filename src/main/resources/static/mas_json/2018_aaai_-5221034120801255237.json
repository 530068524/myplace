{"title": "A Deep Ranking Model for Spatio-Temporal Highlight Detection From a 360\u25e6 Video.", "fields": ["kernel", "sliding window protocol", "inference", "ranking", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "We address the problem of highlight detection from a 360 degree video by summarizing it both spatially and temporally. Given a long 360 degree video, we spatially select pleasantly-looking normal field-of-view (NFOV) segments from unlimited field of views (FOV) of the 360 degree video, and temporally summarize it into a concise and informative highlight as a selected subset of subshots. We propose a novel deep ranking model named as Composition View Score (CVS) model, which produces a spherical score map of composition per video segment, and determines which view is suitable for highlight via a sliding window kernel at inference. To evaluate the proposed framework, we perform experiments on the Pano2Vid benchmark dataset and our newly collected 360 degree video highlight dataset from YouTube and Vimeo. Through evaluation using both quantitative summarization metrics and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art highlight detection methods. We also show that our model is 16 times faster at inference than AutoCam, which is one of the first summarization algorithms of 360 degree videos", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Youngjae Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Youngjae", "Sangho Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sangho", "Joonil Na.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Na:Joonil", "Jaeyun Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Jaeyun", "Gunhee Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Gunhee"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
