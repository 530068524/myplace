It allows rapid development of applications and it provides standardized tools for common operations such as : browsing datasets, applying transformations to one dataset on-the-fly, computing features, indexing multimedia datasets, querying for nearest-neighbors, training a statistical model, or browsing the result in a 3d-space. PyCVF has a Python API, it also provides command line programs, QT Gui, and a web front-end. It can interacts nicely with other leading frameworks such as Weka, Orange, OpenCV, Django...", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "National Institute of Informatics"], "authors": ["Bertrand Nouvel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nouvel:Bertrand", "Shin'ichi Satoh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satoh:Shin=ichi"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
