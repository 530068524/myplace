In particular, we consider five ontologies of models of matter: particle models, fields, two ontologies for continuous material, and a hybrid model. We evaluate these in terms of how easily eleven benchmark physical laws and scenarios can be represented.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["New York University"], "authors": ["Ernest Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Ernest"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
