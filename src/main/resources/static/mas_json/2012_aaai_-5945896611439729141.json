{"title": "Compressed Least-Squares Regression on Sparse Spaces.", "fields": ["least squares", "estimator", "small number", "compressed sensing", "dimensionality reduction"], "abstract": "Recent advances in the area of compressed sensing suggest that it is possible to reconstruct high-dimensional sparse signals from a small number of random projections. Domains in which the sparsity assumption is applicable also offer many interesting large-scale machine learning prediction tasks. It is therefore important to study the effect of random projections as a dimensionality reduction method under such sparsity assumptions. In this paper we develop the bias-variance analysis of a least-squares regression estimator in compressed spaces when random projections are applied on sparse input signals. Leveraging the sparsity assumption, we are able to work with arbitrary non i.i.d. sampling strategies and derive a worst-case bound on the entire space. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets shows how the choice of the projection size affects the performance of regression on compressed spaces, and highlights a range of problems where the method is useful.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University", "McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Mahdi Milani Fard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fard:Mahdi_Milani", "Yuri Grinberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grinberg:Yuri", "Joelle Pineau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pineau:Joelle", "Doina Precup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Precup:Doina"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
