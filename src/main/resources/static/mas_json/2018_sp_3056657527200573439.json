{"title": "EyeTell: Video-Assisted Touchscreen Keystroke Inference from Eye Movements.", "fields": ["video capture", "keystroke logging", "touchscreen", "key", "android"], "abstract": "Keystroke inference attacks pose an increasing threat to ubiquitous mobile devices. This paper presents EyeTell, a novel video-assisted attack that can infer a victim's keystrokes on his touchscreen device from a video capturing his eye movements. EyeTell explores the observation that human eyes naturally focus on and follow the keys they type, so a typing sequence on a soft keyboard results in a unique gaze trace of continuous eye movements. In contrast to prior work, EyeTell requires neither the attacker to visually observe the victim's inputting process nor the victim device to be placed on a static holder. Comprehensive experiments on iOS and Android devices confirm the high efficacy of EyeTell for inferring PINs, lock patterns, and English words under various environmental conditions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "University of Delaware", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Yimin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yimin", "Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Tao", "Rui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Rui", "Yanchao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanchao", "Terri Hedgpeth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hedgpeth:Terri"], "conf": "sp", "year": "2018", "pages": 17}
