Our analysis reveals a number of differences between iBench and typical file-system workload studies, including the complex organization of modern files, the lack of pure sequential access, the influence of underlying frameworks on I/O patterns, the widespread use of file synchronization and atomic operations, and the prevalence of threads. Our results have strong ramifications for the design of next generation local and cloud-based storage systems.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Tyler Harter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harter:Tyler", "Chris Dragga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dragga:Chris", "Michael Vaughn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaughn:Michael", "Andrea C.
