The most obvious source for such a distribution is past data. The goal of this paper is to understand how much data is necessary and sufficient to guarantee near-optimal expected revenue.   Our basic model is a single-item auction in which bidders' valuations are drawn independently from unknown and nonidentical distributions. The seller is given  m  samples from each of these distributions \"for free\" and chooses an auction to run on a fresh sample. How large does  m  need to be, as a function of the number  k  of bidders and  e  0, so that a (1 --  e )-approximation of the optimal revenue is achievable?   We prove that, under standard tail conditions on the underlying distributions,  m  = poly( k , 1/e) samples are necessary and sufficient. Our lower bound stands in contrast to many recent results on simple and prior-independent auctions and fundamentally involves the interplay between bidder competition, non-identical distributions, and a very close (but still constant) approximation of the optimal revenue. It effectively shows that the only way to achieve a sufficiently good constant approximation of the optimal revenue is through a detailed understanding of bidders' valuation distributions. Our upper bound is constructive and applies in particular to a variant of the empirical Myerson auction, the natural auction that runs the revenue-maximizing auction with respect to the empirical distributions of the samples. To capture how our sample complexity upper bound depends on the set of allowable distributions, we introduce  \u03b1 -strongly regular distributions, which interpolate between the well-studied classes of regular ( \u03b1  = 0) and MHR ( \u03b1  = 1) distributions. We give evidence that this definition is of independent interest.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["New York University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Richard Cole.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cole_0001:Richard", "Tim Roughgarden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roughgarden:Tim"], "pages": 10}
