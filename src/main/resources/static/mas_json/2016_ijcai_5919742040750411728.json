{"title": "Unsupervised Word and Dependency Path Embeddings for Aspect Term Extraction.", "fields": ["unsupervised learning", "semeval", "recurrent neural network", "embedding", "conditional random field"], "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a novel approach to aspect term extraction based on unsupervised learning of distributed representations of words and dependency paths. The basic idea is to connect two words (w1 and w2) with the dependency path (r) between them in the embedding space. Specifically, our method optimizes the objective w1 + r \u2248 w2 in the low-dimensional space, where the multihop dependency paths are treated as a sequence of grammatical relations and modeled by a recurrent neural network. Then, we design the embedding features that consider linear context and dependency context information, for the conditional random field (CRF) based aspect term extraction. Experimental results on the SemEval datasets show that, (1) with only embedding features, we can achieve state-of-the-art results; (2) our embedding method which incorporates the syntactic information among words yields better performance than other representative ones in aspect term extraction.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Peking University", "Microsoft", "University of Edinburgh", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yichun Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Yichun", "Furu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Furu", "Li Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong_0004:Li", "Kaimeng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Kaimeng", "Ming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Ming", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming"], "pages": 7}
