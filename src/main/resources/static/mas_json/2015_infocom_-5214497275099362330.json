However, its flexible software-oriented design may be exploited by an adversary to control CR devices to launch large scale attacks on a wide range of critical wireless infrastructures. To proactively mitigate the potentially serious threat, this paper presents MadeCR, a Correlation-based Malware detection system for CR. MadeCR exploits correlations among CR applications' component actions to detect malicious behaviors. In addition, a significant contribution of the paper is a general experimentation method referred to as mutation testing to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of the anomaly detection method against a large number of artificial malware cases. Evaluation shows that MadeCR detects malicious behaviors within 1.10s at an accuracy of 94.9%.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Yanzhi Dou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dou:Yanzhi", "Kexiong Curtis Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Kexiong_Curtis", "Yaling Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yaling", "Danfeng (Daphne) Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Danfeng_=Daphne="], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
