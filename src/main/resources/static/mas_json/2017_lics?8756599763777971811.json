{"title": "Definability of summation problems for Abelian groups and semigroups.", "fields": ["multiplication table", "special classes of semigroups", "descriptive complexity theory", "semigroup", "abelian group"], "abstract": "We study the descriptive complexity of summation problems in Abelian groups and semigroups. In general, an input to the summation problem consists of an Abelian semigroup G, explicitly represented by its multiplication table, and a subset X of G. The task is to determine the sum over all elements of X.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau", "University of Cambridge", "RWTH Aachen University", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Faried Abu Zaid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaid:Faried_Abu", "Anuj Dawar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dawar:Anuj", "Erich Gr\u00e4del.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=auml=del:Erich", "Wied Pakusa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pakusa:Wied"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 11}
