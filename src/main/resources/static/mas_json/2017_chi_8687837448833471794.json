{"title": "Social Printers: A Physical Social Network for Political Debates.", "fields": ["social media", "multimedia", "social network", "referendum", "politics"], "abstract": "Social Printers  are physical devices that create a pseudonymous social network between households during televised political debates. Through studies conducted around the Scottish Parliamentary Election and EU Referendum in 2016, we aimed to understand how physical devices could be used to engage viewers with televised political debates. By displacing the interaction from conventional social media and second screens we observed that the printers were successful in encouraging the participants to share their thoughts and create a personal social experience. Based on the results we discuss potential implications for conventional social media and second screens in the context of political television programs.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Dundee", "University of Dundee", "University of Dundee"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Katerina Gorkovenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorkovenko:Katerina", "Nick Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor_0002:Nick", "Jon Rogers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogers:Jon"], "pages": 13}
