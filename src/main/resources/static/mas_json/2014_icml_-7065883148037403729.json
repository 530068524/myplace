{"title": "Accelerated Proximal Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent for Regularized Loss Minimization.", "fields": ["minification", "elastic net regularization", "logistic regression", "optimization problem", "lasso"], "abstract": "We introduce a proximal version of the stochastic dual coordinate ascent method and show how to accelerate the method using an inner-outer iteration procedure. We analyze the runtime of the framework and obtain rates that improve state-of-the-art results for various key machine learning optimization problems including SVM, logistic regression, ridge regression, Lasso, and multiclass SVM. Experiments validate our theoretical findings.", "citation": "Citations (236)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Shai Shalev-Shwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalev=Shwartz:Shai", "Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Tong"], "pages": 9}
