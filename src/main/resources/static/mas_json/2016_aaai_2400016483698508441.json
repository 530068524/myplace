We introduce a novel method to predict the sarcasm understandability of a reader. Presence of incongruity in textual sarcasm often elicits distinctive eye-movement behavior by human readers. By recording and analyzing the eye-gaze data, we show that eye-movement patterns vary when sarcasm is understood vis-a`-vis when it is not. Motivated by our observations, we propose a system for sarcasm understandability prediction using supervised machine learning. Our system relies on readers' eye-movement parameters and a few textual features, thence, is able to predict sarcasm understandability with an F-score of 93%, which demonstrates its efficacy.\n\nThe availability of inexpensive embedded-eye-trackers on mobile devices creates avenues for applying such research which benefits web-content creators, review writers and social media analysts alike.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "authors": ["Abhijit Mishra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mishra:Abhijit", "Diptesh Kanojia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanojia:Diptesh", "Pushpak Bhattacharyya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhattacharyya:Pushpak"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
