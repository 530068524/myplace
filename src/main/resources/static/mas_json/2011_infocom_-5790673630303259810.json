The inherent operation of P2P systems, which involves repeated interactions among peers over a long time period, allows peers to efficiently identify free-riders as well as desirable collaborators by learning the behavior of their associated peers. Thus, it can help peers improve their download rates and discourage free-riding (FR), while improving fairness. We model the peers' interactions in the BitTorrent-like network as a repeated interaction game, where we explicitly consider the strategic behavior of the peers. A peer that applies the reinforcement learning based mechanism uses a partial history of the observations on associated peers' statistical reciprocal behaviors to determine its best responses and estimate the corresponding impact on its expected utility. The policy determines the peer's resource reciprocations with other peers, which would maximize the peer's long-term performance.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Ewha Womans University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Palo Alto Netwo ... nyvale, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Rafit Izhak-Ratzin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Izhak=Ratzin:Rafit", "Hyunggon Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Hyunggon", "Mihaela van der Schaar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaar:Mihaela_van_der"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
