{"title": "To answer or not: what non-qa social activities can tell.", "fields": ["social media", "data mining", "question answering", "computer science", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "Various methods have been proposed to help find answerers for a question in QA communities, but almost all work heavily depends on users' QA history. In this paper we seek to investigate the feasibility of leveraging users' non-QA social activities as a way of gaining insight into their question answering behavior. We collected data of 4,484 users on a QA community in an enterprise and examined the relationship of their QA behaviors and non-QA activities supported by other social tools. We found that the two sets of behavioral indicators are significantly correlated. The top user group for non-QA activities outperformed lower groups in both number and quality of the answers. Regression analysis showed involvement in personal blog, micro-blog and forum and replying and recommending behaviors in non-QA communities were predictive of a user's likelihood of answering questions. Online observations provided a qualitative understanding. Design implications and future work were discussed.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Yingxin Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Yingxin", "Lin Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Lin", "Chang Yan Chi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chi:Chang_Yan", "Qinying Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Qinying"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 11}
