{"title": "Learning Optimal Subsets with Implicit User Preferences.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "optimality criterion", "preference learning", "problem domain", "active learning"], "abstract": "We study the problem of learning an optimal subset from a larger ground set of items, where the optimality criterion is defined by an unknown preference function. We model the problem as a discriminative structural learning problem and solve it using a Structural Support Vector Machine (SSVM) that optimizes a \"set accuracy\" performance measure representing set similarities. Our approach departs from previous approaches since we do not explicitly learn a pre-defined preference function. Experimental results on both a synthetic problem domain and a real-world face image subset selection problem show that our method significantly outperforms previous learning approaches for such problems.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Yunsong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yunsong", "Carla P.
