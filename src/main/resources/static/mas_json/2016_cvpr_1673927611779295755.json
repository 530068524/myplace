{"title": "Jointly Modeling Embedding and Translation to Bridge Video and Language.", "fields": ["artificial neural network", "natural language", "semantics", "embedding", "sentence"], "abstract": "Automatically describing video content with natural language is a fundamental challenge of computer vision. Re-current Neural Networks (RNNs), which models sequence dynamics, has attracted increasing attention on visual interpretation. However, most existing approaches generate a word locally with the given previous words and the visual content, while the relationship between sentence semantics and visual content is not holistically exploited. As a result, the generated sentences may be contextually correct but the semantics (e.g., subjects, verbs or objects) are not true. This paper presents a novel unified framework, named Long Short-Term Memory with visual-semantic Embedding (LSTM-E), which can simultaneously explore the learning of LSTM and visual-semantic embedding. The former aims to locally maximize the probability of generating the next word given previous words and visual content, while the latter is to create a visual-semantic embedding space for enforcing the relationship between the semantics of the entire sentence and visual content. The experiments on YouTube2Text dataset show that our proposed LSTM-E achieves to-date the best published performance in generating natural sentences: 45.3% and 31.0% in terms of BLEU@4 and METEOR, respectively. Superior performances are also reported on two movie description datasets (M-VAD and MPII-MD). In addition, we demonstrate that LSTM-E outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in predicting Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triplets.", "citation": "Citations (189)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yingwei Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Yingwei", "Tao Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Tao", "Ting Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Ting", "Houqiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Houqiang", "Yong Rui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rui:Yong"], "pages": 9}
