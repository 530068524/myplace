In x-ray images, however, this assumption is violated, since x-ray photons penetrate most materials. In this paper, we introduce SATIS\u03c6, a method for separating objects in a set of x-ray images using the property of additivity in log space, where the log-attenuation at a pixel is the sum of the log-attenuations of all objects that the corresponding x-ray passes through. Our method leverages multiple projection views of the same scene from slightly different angles to produce an accurate estimate of attenuation properties of objects in the scene. These properties can be used to identify the material composition of these objects, and are therefore crucial for applications like automatic threat detection. We evaluate SATIS\u03c6 on a set of collected x-ray scans, showing that it outperforms a standard image segmentation approach and reduces the error of material estimation.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Qylur Security  ...
