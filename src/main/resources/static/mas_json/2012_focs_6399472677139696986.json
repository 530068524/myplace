Consider the problem of computing max $st$-flow values in $G$ from a fixed source $s$ to all sinks $t \\in V \\set minus \\{s\\}$. We show how to solve this problem in near-linear $O(n \\log^3 n)$ time. Previously, nothing better was known than running a single-source single-sink max flow algorithm $n-1$ times, giving a total time bound of $O(n^2 \\log n)$ with the algorithm of Borradaile and Klein. An important implication is that all-pairs max $st$-flow values in $G$ can be computed in near-quadratic time. This is close to optimal as the output size is $\\Theta(n^2)$. We give a quadratic lower bound on the number of distinct max flow values and an $\\Omega(n^3)$ lower bound for the total size of all min cut-sets. This distinguishes the problem from the undirected case where the number of distinct max flow values is $O(n)$. Previous to our result, no algorithm which could solve the all-pairs max flow values problem faster than the time of $\\Theta(n^2)$ max-flow computations for every planar digraph was known. This result is accompanied with a data structure that reports min cut-sets. For fixed $s$ and all $t$, after $O(n^{1.5} \\log^2 n)$ preprocessing time, it can report the set of arcs $C$ crossing a min $st$-cut in $O(|C|)$ time.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "Tel Aviv University", "University of Warsaw", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Jakub Lacki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lacki:Jakub", "Yahav Nussbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nussbaum:Yahav", "Piotr Sankowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankowski:Piotr", "Christian Wulff-Nilsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulff=Nilsen:Christian"], "pages": 10}
