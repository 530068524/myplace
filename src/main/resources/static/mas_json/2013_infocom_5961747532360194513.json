{"title": "On the interaction between content-oriented traffic scheduling and revenue sharing among providers.", "fields": ["internet traffic", "internet transit", "peering", "revenue sharing", "net neutrality"], "abstract": "The Internet consists of economically selfish players in terms of access/transit connection, content distribution, and users. Such selfish behaviors often lead to techno-economic inefficiencies such as unstable peering and revenue imbalance. Recent research results suggest that cooperation in revenue sharing (thus multi-level ISP settlements) can be a candidate solution for the problem of unfair revenue share. However, it is unclear whether providers are willing to behave cooperatively. In this paper, we study the interaction between how content-oriented traffic scheduling at the edge is and how stable the intended cooperation is. We consider three traffic scheduling policies having various degrees of content-value preference, compare them in terms of implementation complexity, network neutrality, and stability of cooperation, and present interesting trade-offs among them.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Sch. of Inf. &  ... ockholm, Sweden"], "authors": ["Hyojung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hyojung", "Hyeryung Jang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jang:Hyeryung", "Yung Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Yung", "Jeong-woo Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Jeong=woo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
