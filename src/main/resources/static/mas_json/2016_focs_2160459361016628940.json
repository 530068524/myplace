We give an efficient algorithm that finds a coloring with discrepancy O((t log n)1/2), matching the best known non-constructive bound for the problem due to Banaszczyk. The previous algorithms only achieved an O(t1/2 log n) bound. Our result also extends to the more general Komlos setting and gives an algorithmic O(log1/2 n) bound.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Nikhil Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Nikhil", "Daniel Dadush.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dadush:Daniel", "Shashwat Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Shashwat"], "pages": 12}
