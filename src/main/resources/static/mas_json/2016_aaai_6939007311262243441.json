{"title": "Bidirectional Search That Is Guaranteed to Meet in the Middle.", "fields": ["heuristic", "mathematical optimization", "machine learning", "midpoint", "bidirectional search"], "abstract": "We present MM, the first bidirectional heuristic search algorithm whose forward and backward searches are guaranteed to \"meet in the middle\", i.e. never expand a node beyond the solution midpoint. We also present a novel framework for comparing MM, A*, and brute-force search, and identify conditions favoring each algorithm. Finally, we present experimental results that support our theoretical analysis.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Denver"], "authors": ["Robert C.
