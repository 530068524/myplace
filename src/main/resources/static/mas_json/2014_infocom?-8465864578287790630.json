{"title": "Analysis of a proportionally fair and locally adaptive Spatial Aloha in Poisson Networks.", "fields": ["proportionally fair", "stochastic geometry", "expression", "parametric statistics", "discrete event simulation"], "abstract": "The proportionally fair sharing of the capacity of a Poisson network using Spatial-Aloha leads to closed-form performance expressions in two extreme cases: (1) the case without topology information, where the analysis boils down to a parametric optimization problem leveraging stochastic geometry; (2) the case with full network topology information, which was recently solved using shot-noise techniques. We show that there exists a continuum of adaptive controls between these two extremes, based on local stopping sets, which can also be analyzed in closed form. We also show that these control schemes are implementable, in contrast to the full information case which is not. As local information increases, the performance levels of these schemes are shown to get arbitrarily close to those of the full information scheme. The analytical results are combined with discrete event simulation to provide a detailed evaluation of the performance of this class of medium access controls.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Baccelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baccelli:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Bartlomiej Blaszczyszyn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blaszczyszyn:Bartlomiej", "Chandramani Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Chandramani"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
