As shown by Kirsten, the star height problem reduces to a problem concerning automata with counters, called limitedness. The new contribution is a different algorithm for the limitedness problem, which reduces it to solving a Gale-Stewart game with an a#x03C9;-regular winning condition.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Mikolaj Bojanczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bojanczyk:Mikolaj"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 6}
