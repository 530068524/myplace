It automatically identifies parts of the program code that are relevant for security and generates an HTML report to guide security auditors audit the source code in a scalable way. JoanAudit is configured with various security-sensitive input sources and sinks relevant to injection vulnerabilities and standard sanitization procedures that prevent these vulnerabilities. It can also automatically fix some cases of vulnerabilities in source code \u2014 cases where inputs are directly used in sinks without any form of sanitization \u2014 by using standard sanitization procedures. Our evaluation shows that by using JoanAudit, security auditors are required to inspect only 1% of the total code for auditing common injection vulnerabilities.
