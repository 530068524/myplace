There is a class H of host graphs. One selects a graph H \u2208 H and plants in it a balanced k-coloring (by partitioning the vertex set into k roughly equal parts, and removing all edges within each part). The resulting graph G is given as input to a polynomial time algorithm that needs to k-color G (any legal k-coloring would do \u2013 the algorithm is not required to recover the planted k-coloring). Earlier planted models correspond to the case that H is the class of all n-vertex d-regular graphs, a member H \u2208 H is chosen at random, and then a balanced k-coloring is planted at random. Blum and Spencer [1995] designed algorithms for this model when d = n \u03b4 (for 0", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Roee David.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/David:Roee", "Uriel Feige.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feige:Uriel"], "pages": 14}
