The number of layers received determines the quality of the decoded video stream. For such layered multicast streaming, network coding provides higher capacity than multicast routing. Network coding can be performed within a layer (intra-layer) or across layers (inter-layer), and in general inter-layer coding outperforms intra-layer coding. An optimal solution to a network coded layered multicast problem may require decoding of the network code at interior nodes to extract information to be forwarded. However, decoding consumes resources and introduces delay, which is particularly undesirable at interior nodes (the routers) of the network. In this paper, we thus focus on the inter-layer network coding problem without decoding at interior nodes. We propose a heuristic algorithm for rate allocation and code assignment based on the Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and perform simulations that show that our algorithm may even outperform other heuristics that do require decoding at interior nodes.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["IMDEA Networks", "IMDEA Networks", "IMDEA Networks", "IMDEA Networks"], "authors": ["Joerg Widmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Widmer:Joerg", "Andrea Capalbo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capalbo:Andrea", "Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez Anta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anta:Antonio_Fern=aacute=ndez", "Albert Banchs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banchs:Albert"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
