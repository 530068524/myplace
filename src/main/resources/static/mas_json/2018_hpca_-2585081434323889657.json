This paper describes and analyzes OuterSPACE, an accelerator targeted at applications that involve large sparse matrices. OuterSPACE is a highly-scalable, energy-efficient, reconfigurable design, consisting of massively parallel Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD)-style processing units, distributed memories, high-speed crossbars and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). We identify redundant memory accesses to non-zeros as a key bottleneck in traditional sparse matrix-matrix multiplication algorithms. To ameliorate this, we implement an outer product based matrix multiplication technique that eliminates redundant accesses by decoupling multiplication from accumulation. We demonstrate that traditional architectures, due to limitations in their memory hierarchies and ability to harness parallelism in the algorithm, are unable to take advantage of this reduction without incurring significant overheads. OuterSPACE is designed to specifically overcome these challenges. We simulate the key components of our architecture using gem5 on a diverse set of matrices from the University of Florida's SuiteSparse collection and the Stanford Network Analysis Project and show a mean speedup of 7.9\u00d7 over Intel Math Kernel Library on a Xeon CPU, 13.0\u00d7 against cuSPARSE and 14.0\u00d7 against CUSP when run on an NVIDIA K40 GPU, while achieving an average throughput of 2.9 GFLOPS within a 24 W power budget in an area of 87 mm2.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Subhankar Pal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pal:Subhankar", "Jonathan Beaumont.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beaumont:Jonathan", "Dong-Hyeon Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Dong=Hyeon", "Aporva Amarnath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amarnath:Aporva", "Siying Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Siying", "Chaitali Chakrabarti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakrabarti:Chaitali", "Hun-Seok Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hun=Seok", "David T.
