We present a unified formalization of stochastic And-Or grammars that is agnostic to the type of the data being modeled, and propose an unsupervised approach to learning the structures as well as the parameters of such grammars. Starting from a trivial initial grammar, our approach iteratively induces compositions and reconfigurations in a unified manner and optimizes the posterior probability of the grammar. In our empirical evaluation, we applied our approach to learning event grammars and image grammars and achieved comparable or better performance than previous approaches.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Kewei Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Kewei", "Maria Pavlovskaia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pavlovskaia:Maria", "Song Chun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Song_Chun"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
