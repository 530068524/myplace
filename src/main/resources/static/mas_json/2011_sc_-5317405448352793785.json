{"title": "An early performance analysis of POWER7-IH HPC systems.", "fields": ["parallel computing", "supercomputer", "distributed computing", "architecture", "benchmarking"], "abstract": "In this work we present a performance evaluation of the POWER7-IH processor and of integrated systems built from it. We describe the architecture of P7-IH with an emphasis on those characteristics that have a direct impact on the performance for large-scale HPC systems and applications. An important area of emphasis is the memory and communication subsystems and their impact on achievable application performance. The results from a set of micro-benchmarks are presented that include memory, communication and OS-noise characteristics. In addition the results from several production level applications are analyzed and their performance linked to the results of the micro-benchmarks through the use of accurate performance models. The models will also be employed in exploring the achievable performance of these applications on much larger systems.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Kevin J.
