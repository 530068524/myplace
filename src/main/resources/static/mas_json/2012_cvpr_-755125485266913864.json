Most of the state-of-the-art basic-level object classification algorithms have difficulties in this challenging problem. One reason for this can be attributed to the popular codebook-based image representation, often resulting in loss of subtle image information that are critical for fine-grained classification. Another way to address this problem is to introduce human annotations of object attributes or key points, a tedious process that is also difficult to generalize to new tasks. In this work, we propose a codebook-free and annotation-free approach for fine-grained image categorization. Instead of using vector-quantized codewords, we obtain an image representation by running a high throughput template matching process using a large number of randomly generated image templates. We then propose a novel bagging-based algorithm to build a final classifier by aggregating a set of discriminative yet largely uncorrelated classifiers. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classification approaches on the Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset.", "citation": "Citations (147)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Industrial Perc ... , Palo Alto, CA"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Bangpeng Yao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yao:Bangpeng", "Gary R.
