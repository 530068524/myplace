After the first candidate construction by Garg, Gentry and Halevi (GGH) based on ideal lattices, a second construction over the integers was described by Coron, Lepoint and Tibouchi (CLT). However the CLT scheme was recently broken by Cheon et al.; the attack works by computing the eigenvalues of a diagonalizable matrix over \\({\\mathbb Q}\\) derived from the multilinear map.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "CryptoExperts", "NTT Secure Plat ... rm Laboratories"], "authors": ["Jean-S\u00e9bastien Coron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coron:Jean=S=eacute=bastien", "Tancr\u00e8de Lepoint.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepoint:Tancr=egrave=de", "Mehdi Tibouchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tibouchi:Mehdi"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
