Our goal is to classify different event categories based on the visual content of a group of photos that constitute the event. Such photo groups are typical in a personal photo collection of different events. Visual features are extracted from the images, yet the features from individual images are often noisy and not all of them represent the distinguishing characteristics of an event. We employ the PageRank technique to mine the most informative features from the images that belong to the same event. Subsequently, we classify different event categories using the multiple images of the same event because we argue that they are more informative about the content of an event rather than any single image. We compare our proposed approach with the standard bag of features method (BOF) and observe considerable improvements in recognition accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Rochester", "University of Central Florida"], "authors": ["Naveed Imran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Imran:Naveed", "Jingen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jingen", "Jiebo Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Jiebo", "Mubarak Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Mubarak"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
