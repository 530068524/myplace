We show that the satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems for this logic are both NExpTime-complete. We further show that the corresponding problems for two-variable first-order logic with counting and  two  equivalences are both undecidable.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Manchester"], "authors": ["Ian Pratt-Hartmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pratt=Hartmann:Ian"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
