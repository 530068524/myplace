Our network takes a source image and a target aspect ratio, and then directly outpues a retargeted image. Retargeting is performed through a shift reap, which is a pixet-wise mapping from the source to the target grid. Our method implicitly learns an attention map, which leads to r content-aware shift map for image retargeting. As a result, discriminative parts in an image are preserved, while background regions are adjusted seamlessly. In the training phase, pairs of an image and its image-level annotation are used to compute content and structure tosses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for a retargeting application with insightful analyses.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Tencent", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Tencent", "KAIST"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Donghyeon Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Donghyeon", "Jinsun Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jinsun", "Tae-Hyun Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Tae=Hyun", "Yu-Wing Tai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tai:Yu=Wing", "In So Kweon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kweon:In_So"], "pages": 10}
