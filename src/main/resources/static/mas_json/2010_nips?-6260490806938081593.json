We propose formulating the L1 regularized linear fixed point problem as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). This formulation offers several advantages over the LARS-inspired formulation, LARS-TD. The LCP formulation allows the use of efficient off-the-shelf solvers, leads to a new uniqueness result, and can be initialized with starting points from similar problems (warm starts). We demonstrate that warm starts, as well as the efficiency of LCP solvers, can speed up policy iteration. Moreover, warm starts permit a form of modified policy iteration that canbeusedto approximate a \"greedy\" homotopy path, a generalization of the LARS-TD homotopy path that combines policy evaluation and optimization.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Jeffrey Johns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johns:Jeffrey", "Christopher Painter-Wakefield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Painter=Wakefield:Christopher", "Ronald Parr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parr:Ronald"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
