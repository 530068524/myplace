{"title": "iLOC: An invisible LOCalization Attack to Internet Threat Monitoring Systems.", "fields": ["web threat", "computer worm", "denial of service attack", "the internet", "data center"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study a new class of attacks, the  i nvisible  LOC alization ( iLOC ) attack, which can accurately and invisibly localize monitors of Internet threat monitoring (ITM) systems, a class of widely deployed facilities to characterize Internet threats, such as worm propagation, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In the  iLOC  attack, the attacker launches low-rate port-scan traffic, encoded with a selected  pseudo-noise   code  (PN- code), to targeted networks. While the secret PN-code is invisible to others, the attacker can accurately determine the existence of monitors in the targeted networks based on whether the PN-code is embedded in the report data queried from the data center of the ITM system. We conduct extensive simulations on the  iLOC  attack using real-world traces. Our data demonstrate that the  iLOC  attack can accurately identify monitors while remaining invisible to the ITM. Finally, we present a set of guidelines to counteract the  iLOC  attack.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Texas A&M University", "Dakota State University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Xun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xun", "Wei Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0002:Wei", "Xinwen Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Xinwen", "Dong Xuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xuan:Dong", "Wei Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Wei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
