{"title": "Linux Kernel Developer Responses to Static Analysis Bug Reports.", "fields": ["codebase", "static program analysis", "software quality", "software bug", "static analysis"], "abstract": "We present a study of how Linux kernel developers respond to bug reports issued by a static analysis tool. We found that developers prefer to triage reports in younger, smaller, and more actively-maintained files (\u00a72), first address easy-to-fix bugs and defer difficult (but possibly critical) bugs (\u00a73), and triage bugs in batches rather than individually (\u00a74). Also, although automated tools cannot find many types of bugs, they can be effective at directing developers' attentions towards parts of the codebase that contain up to 3X more user-reported bugs (\u00a75).\n\nOur insights into developer attitudes towards static analysis tools allow us to make suggestions for improving their usability and effectiveness. We feel that it could be effective to run static analysis tools continuously while programming and before committing code, to rank reports so that those most likely to be triaged are shown to developers first, to show the easiest reports to new developers, to perform deeper analysis on more actively-maintained code, and to use reports as indirect indicators of code quality and importance.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Philip J.
