{"title": "Probabilistic Polynomials and Hamming Nearest Neighbors.", "fields": ["closest pair of points problem", "hamming code", "hamming graph", "symmetric boolean function", "majority function"], "abstract": "We show how to compute any symmetric Boolean function on n variables over any field (as well as the integers) with a probabilistic polynomial of degree O(a#x221A;n log(1/a#x03B5;))) and error at most a#x03B5;. The degree dependence on n and a#x03B5; is optimal, matching a lower bound of Razborov (1987) and Smolensky (1987) for the MAJORITY function. The proof is constructive: a low-degree polynomial can be efficiently sampled from the distribution. This polynomial construction is combined with other algebraic ideas to give the first sub quadratic time algorithm for computing a (worst-case) batch of Hamming distances in super logarithmic dimensions, exactly. To illustrate, let c(n): N -> N. Suppose we are given a database D of n vectors in {0, 1} (c(n) log n) and a collection of n query vectors Q in the same dimension. For all u in Q, we wish to compute a v in D with minimum Hamming distance from u. We solve this problem in n(2-1/O(c(n) log2 c(n))) randomized time. Hence, the problem is in \"truly sub quadratic\" time for O(log n) dimensions, and in sub quadratic time for d = o((log2 n)/(log log n)2). We apply the algorithm to computing pairs with maximum inner product, closest pair in l1 for vectors with bounded integer entries, and pairs with maximum Jaccard coefficients.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Josh Alman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alman:Josh", "Ryan Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams_0001:Ryan"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 15}
