In this paper, we propose a virtual advertisement system with novel advertising strategy, called Virtual Spotlighted Advertising (ViSA), for broadcasting tennis videos. We take psychology, advertising theory, and computational aesthetics into account for improving the effectiveness of advertising. ViSA system automatically detects the candidate insertion points in both temporal and spatial domains and estimates the maximum effective region for message communication. Then, the harmonically re-colored advertisements with foveation model based non-uniform transparency, are projected on the court in tennis videos. The experiments and evaluation results showed the effectiveness of ViSA, for sports video advertising, in terms of recall and recognition.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Chia-Hu Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Chia=Hu", "Kuei-Yi Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Kuei=Yi", "Ming-Che Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Ming=Che", "Ja-Ling Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ja=Ling"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
