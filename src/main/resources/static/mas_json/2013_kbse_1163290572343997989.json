The appearance of conflicts among user configurations is a main concern. Current approaches focus on avoiding such conflicts, applying the mutual exclusion principle. However, this perspective has a negative impact on users satisfaction, who cannot make any decision fairly. In this work, we propose an interpretation of multi-user configuration as a game theoretic problem. Game theory is a well-known discipline which analyzes conflicts and cooperation among intelligent rational decision-makers. We present a taxonomy of multi-user configuration approaches, and how they can be interpreted as different problems of game theory. We focus on cooperative game theory to propose and automate a tradeoff-based bargaining approach, as a way to solve the conflicts and maximize user satisfaction at the same time.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Seville", "University of Seville", "University of Seville"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda-Gal\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garc=iacute=a=Gal=aacute=n:Jes=uacute=s", "Pablo Trinidad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trinidad:Pablo", "Antonio Ruiz Cort\u00e9s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cort=eacute=s:Antonio_Ruiz"], "pages": 6}
