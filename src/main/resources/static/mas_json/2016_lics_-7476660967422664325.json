The coverability problem captures the verification of safety properties in this nominal extension of Petri nets with name management and fresh name creation. Our completeness result establishes \u03bd-Petri nets as a model of intermediate power among the formalisms of nets enriched with data, and relies on new algorithmic insights brought by the use of well-quasi-order ideals.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"], "authors": ["Ranko Lazic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazic:Ranko", "Sylvain Schmitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmitz:Sylvain"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
