{"title": "Linking transcribed conversational speech.", "fields": ["computer science", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "As large collections of historically significant recorded speech become increasingly available, scholars are faced with the challenge of making sense of what they hear. This paper proposes automatically linking conversational speech to related resources as one way of supporting that sense-making task. Experiment results with transcribed conversations suggest that this kind of linking has promise for helping to contextualize recordings of detail-oriented conversations, and that simple sliding-window bag-of-words techniques can identify some useful links.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Eleanor Rooseve ... enbelt, MD, USA"], "authors": ["Joseph Malionek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malionek:Joseph", "Douglas W.
