{"title": "It's Just My History Isn't It?: Understanding Smart Journaling Practices.", "fields": ["personal record", "nomothetic and idiographic", "multimedia", "journaling file system", "lifelog"], "abstract": "Smart journals are both an emerging class of lifelogging applications and novel digital possessions, which are used to create and curate a personal record of one's life. Through an in-depth interview study of analogue and digital journaling practices, and by drawing on a wide range of research around --technologies of memory?, we address fundamental questions about how people manage and value digital records of the past. Appreciating journaling as deeply idiographic, we map a broad range of user practices and motivations and use this understanding to ground four design considerations: recognizing the motivation to  account for one's life ; supporting the  authoring of a unique perspective  and finding a place for  passive tracking as a chronicle . Finally, we argue that smart journals signal a maturing orientation to issues of digital archiving.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Newcastle University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chris Elsden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elsden:Chris", "Abigail C.
