However, as this radiative transfer is in-band, it directly impacts data communication in the network, requiring a fresh perspective on medium access control (MAC) protocol design for appropriately sharing the channel for these two critical functions. Through an experimental study, we first demonstrate how the placement, the chosen frequency, and number of the RF energy transmitters affect the sensor charging time. These studies are then used to design a MAC protocol called RFMAC that optimizes energy delivery to desirous sensor nodes on request. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed MAC protocol for RF energy harvesting sensors, and through a combination of experimentation and simulation studies, we demonstrate 112% average network throughput improvement over the modified unslotted CSMA MAC protocol.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Prusayon Nintanavongsa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nintanavongsa:Prusayon", "M.
