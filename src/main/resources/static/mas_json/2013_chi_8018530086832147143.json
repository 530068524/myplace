{"title": "I see you there!: developing identity-preserving embodied interaction for museum exhibits.", "fields": ["interaction design", "personalization", "probabilistic logic", "exhibition", "embodied cognition"], "abstract": "Museums are increasingly embracing technologies that provide highly-individualized and highly-interactive experiences to visitors. With embodied interaction experiences, increased localization accuracy supports greater nuance in interaction design, but there is usually a tradeoff between fast, accurate tracking and the ability to preserve the identity of users. Customization of experience relies on the ability to detect the identity of visitors, however. We present a method that combines fine-grained indoor tracking with robust preservation of the unique identities of multiple users. Our model merges input from an RFID reader with input from a commercial camera-based tracking system. We developed a probabilistic Bayesian model to infer at run-time the correct identification of the subjects in the camera's field of view. This method, tested in a lab and at a local museum, requires minimal modification to the exhibition space, while addressing several identity-preservation problems for which many indoor tracking systems do not have robust solutions.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Francesco Cafaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cafaro:Francesco", "Alessandro Panella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panella:Alessandro", "Leilah Lyons.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyons:Leilah", "Jessica Roberts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roberts:Jessica", "Joshua Radinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radinsky:Joshua"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
