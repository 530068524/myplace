{"title": "Situated Mapping of Sequential Instructions to Actions with Single-step Reward Observation.", "fields": ["computer science", "maximization", "situated", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We propose a learning approach for mapping context-dependent sequential instructions to actions. We address the problem of discourse and state dependencies with an attention-based model that considers both the history of the interaction and the state of the world. To train from start and goal states without access to demonstrations, we propose SESTRA, a learning algorithm that takes advantage of single-step reward observations and immediate expected reward maximization. We evaluate on the SCONE domains, and show absolute accuracy improvements of 9.8%-25.3% across the domains over approaches that use high-level logical representations.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Cornell University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yoav Artzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Artzi:Yoav", "Alane Suhr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suhr:Alane"], "pages": 11}
