{"title": "Intrusion recovery for database-backed web applications.", "fields": ["scripting language", "sql injection", "clickjacking", "rollback", "web server"], "abstract": "Warp is a system that helps users and administrators of web applications recover from intrusions such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and clickjacking attacks, while preserving legitimate user changes. Warp repairs from an intrusion by rolling back parts of the database to a version before the attack, and replaying subsequent legitimate actions. Warp allows administrators to  retroactively patch  security vulnerabilities---i.e., apply new security patches to past executions---to recover from intrusions without requiring the administrator to track down or even detect attacks. Warp's  time-travel database  allows fine-grained rollback of database rows, and enables repair to proceed concurrently with normal operation of a web application. Finally, Warp  captures and replays user input at the level of a browser's DOM , to recover from attacks that involve a user's browser. For a web server running MediaWiki, Warp requires no application source code changes to recover from a range of common web application vulnerabilities with minimal user input at a cost of 24--27% in throughput and 2--3.2 GB/day in storage.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ramesh Chandra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandra:Ramesh", "Taesoo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Taesoo", "Meelap Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Meelap", "Neha Narula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narula:Neha", "Nickolai Zeldovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeldovich:Nickolai"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2011", "pages": 14}
