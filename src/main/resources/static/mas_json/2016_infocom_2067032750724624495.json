{"title": "DESIR: Decoy-enhanced seamless IP randomization.", "fields": ["decoy", "randomization", "virtual machine", "network topology", "server"], "abstract": "Sophisticated adversaries usually initiate their attacks with a reconnaissance phase to discover exploitable vulnerabilities on the targeted networks and systems. To mitigate the effectiveness of persistent reconnaissance attacks, we develop a defensive mechanism that dynamically mutates network topology with a large number of decoys to invalidate the attacker's knowledge from network scanning. We combine the IP randomization technique with decoy techniques and solve two challenges, namely, service availability to legitimate users and service security against unauthorized users. First, our solution can minimize the probability of the real servers being identified and compromised by unauthorized users through deploying a large number of decoy nodes, which change their IP addresses along with the real servers to prolong the scanning time of the attackers. Second, our solution can ensure seamless connection migration so that all existing communication connections between the legitimate users and the servers are always kept alive even after the servers migrate to different IP addresses multiple times. We implement a virtual machine based system prototype and evaluate it using state-of-the-art scanning techniques. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our solution can effectively mitigate network reconnaissance attacks without sacrificing service availability.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary"], "authors": ["Jianhua Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Jianhua", "Kun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Kun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
