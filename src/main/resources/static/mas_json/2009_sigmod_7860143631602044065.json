{"title": "A comparison of flexible schemas for software as a service.", "fields": ["semi structured model", "star schema", "schema migration", "schema evolution", "multitenancy"], "abstract": "A multi-tenant database system for Software as a Service (SaaS) should offer schemas that are flexible in that they can be  extended  different versions of the application and dynamically  modified  while the system is on-line. This paper presents an experimental comparison of five techniques for implementing flexible schemas for SaaS. In three of these techniques, the database \"owns\" the schema in that its structure is explicitly defined in DDL. Included here is the commonly-used mapping where each tenant is given their own private tables, which we take as the baseline, and a mapping that employs Sparse Columns in Microsoft SQL Server. These techniques perform well, however they offer only limited support for schema evolution in the presence of existing data. Moreover they do not scale beyond a certain level. In the other two techniques, the application \"owns\" the schema in that it is mapped into generic structures in the database. Included here are XML in DB2 and Pivot Tables in HBase. These techniques give the application complete control over schema evolution, however they can produce a significant decrease in performance. We conclude that the ideal database for SaaS has not yet been developed and offer some suggestions as to how it should be designed.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Stefan Aulbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aulbach:Stefan", "Dean Jacobs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobs:Dean", "Alfons Kemper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kemper:Alfons", "Michael Seibold.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seibold:Michael"], "pages": 8}
