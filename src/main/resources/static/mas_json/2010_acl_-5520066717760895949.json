{"title": "Faster Parsing by Supertagger Adaptation.", "fields": ["parser combinator", "simple lr parser", "machine learning", "natural language processing", "parsing"], "abstract": "We propose a novel self-training method for a parser which uses a lexicalised grammar and supertagger, focusing on increasing the speed of the parser rather than its accuracy. The idea is to train the supertagger on large amounts of parser output, so that the supertagger can learn to supply the supertags that the parser will eventually choose as part of the highest-scoring derivation. Since the supertagger supplies fewer supertags overall, the parsing speed is increased. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a CCG supertagger and parser, obtaining significant speed increases on newspaper text with no loss in accuracy. We also show that the method can be used to adapt the CCG parser to new domains, obtaining accuracy and speed improvements for Wikipedia and biomedical text.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Sydney", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Sydney", "University of Sydney", "University of Sydney"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jonathan K.
