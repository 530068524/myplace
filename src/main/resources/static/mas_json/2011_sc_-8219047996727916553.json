In the iterative implementations that we consider, each step both reads and updates a database of parameter values. Motivated by a need for rapid analysis of large corpora, we have developed methods for efficient access to such databases on parallel computers. These methods combine Bloom filters, in-memory caches, and an HBase cluster to reduce communication costs greatly relative to simpler approaches that either fully distribute or fully replicate the database. Our design can achieve considerable run time, latency and storage space improvements relative to other methods. In one segmentation application, we improve performance by a factor of 3 relative to an HBase-based implementation.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "Argonne National Laboratory", "University of Chicago", "Computation Ins ... hicago, IL, USA"], "authors": ["Atilla Soner Balkir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balkir:Atilla_Soner", "Ian T.
