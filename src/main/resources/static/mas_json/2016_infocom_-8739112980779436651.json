{"title": "The S-Aloha capacity: Beyond the e-1 myth.", "fields": ["random access", "exponential function", "infinity", "aloha", "binary number"], "abstract": "The stability and throughput of the Slotted Aloha protocol have been studied at length, yielding results that depend on the environment and channel assumptions, in many cases indicating e\u22121 as the S-Aloha capacity. When users can detect only their own collisions, and the number of users N goes to infinity, no definite capacity result exists. Approximated models have been introduced to study the exponential back-off mechanism, which seem to indicate an asymptotic capacity of ln(2)/2 when binary back-off is used, and again e\u22121 when the exponential base is optimized. Here we introduce a more accurate and flexible model that shows that past results miss their mark. In fact, we prove that with binary back-off the capacity is practically 0.370, slightly greater than e\u22121; furthermore, and more important, we prove that using 1.35 as exponential back-off base, the capacity reaches 0.4303 with an infinite number of users, and up to 0.496 with N = 2 users.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "authors": ["Luca Barletta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barletta:Luca", "Flaminio Borgonovo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borgonovo:Flaminio", "Ilario Filippini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filippini:Ilario"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
