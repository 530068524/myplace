Given an over-complete normal basis set (e.g., an image sequence or a collection of local spatio-temporal patches), we introduce the sparse reconstruction cost (SRC) over the normal dictionary to measure the normalness of the testing sample. To condense the size of the dictionary, a novel dictionary selection method is designed with sparsity consistency constraint. By introducing the prior weight of each basis during sparse reconstruction, the proposed SRC is more robust compared to other outlier detection criteria. Our method provides a unified solution to detect both local abnormal events (LAE) and global abnormal events (GAE). We further extend it to support online abnormal event detection by updating the dictionary incrementally. Experiments on three benchmark datasets and the comparison to the state-of-the-art methods validate the advantages of our algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (444)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yang Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Yang", "Junsong Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Junsong", "Ji Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0002:Ji"], "pages": 8}
