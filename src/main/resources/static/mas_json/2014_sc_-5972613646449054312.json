Due to power and I/O constraints, we expect  in situ  visualization and analysis will be a critical component of these workflows. Options for extreme scale data analysis are often presented as a stark contrast: write large files to disk for interactive, exploratory analysis, or perform  in situ  analysis to save detailed data about phenomena that a scientists knows about in advance. We present a novel framework for a third option -- a highly interactive, image-based approach that promotes exploration of simulation results, and is easily accessed through extensions to widely used open source tools. This  in situ  approach supports interactive exploration of a wide range of results, while still significantly reducing data movement and storage.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["Los Alamos National Laboratory", "Kitware", "Kitware", "Los Alamos National Laboratory", "Los Alamos National Laboratory"], "authors": ["James P.
