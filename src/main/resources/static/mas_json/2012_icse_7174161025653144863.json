First, there is a lack of integration of WSNs with business process modeling languages and back-ends. Second, programming WSNs is still challenging as it is mainly performed at the operating system level. To this end, we provide makeSense: a unified programming framework and a compilation chain that, from high-level business process specifications, generates code ready for deployment on WSN nodes.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento", "Swedish Institute of Computer Science", "Swedish Institute of Computer Science", "University of Trento", "Tomsk Polytechnic University", "Swedish Institute of Computer Science", "Swedish Institute of Computer Science", "SAP AG (Germany)"], "authors": ["Fabio Casati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casati:Fabio", "Florian Daniel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daniel:Florian", "Guenadi Dantchev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dantchev:Guenadi", "Joakim Eriksson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eriksson:Joakim", "Niclas Finne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finne:Niclas", "Stamatis Karnouskos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karnouskos:Stamatis", "Patricio Moreno Montero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montero:Patricio_Moreno", "Luca Mottola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mottola:Luca", "Felix Jonathan Oppermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oppermann:Felix_Jonathan", "Gian Pietro Picco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Picco:Gian_Pietro", "Antonio Quartulli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quartulli:Antonio", "Kay R\u00f6mer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=ouml=mer:Kay", "Patrik Spiess.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spiess:Patrik", "Stefano Tranquillini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tranquillini:Stefano", "Thiemo Voigt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voigt:Thiemo"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
