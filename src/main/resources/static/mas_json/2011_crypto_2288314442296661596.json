{"title": "The Torsion-Limit for Algebraic Function Fields and Its Application to Arithmetic Secret Sharing.", "fields": ["verifiable secret sharing", "algebraic function", "homomorphic secret sharing", "shamir s secret sharing", "divisor"], "abstract": "An (n, t, d, n-t)-arithmetic secret sharing scheme (with uniformity) for Fqk over Fq is an Fq-linear secret sharing scheme where the secret is selected from Fqk and each of the n shares is an element of Fq. Moreover, there is t-privacy (in addition, any t shares are uniformly random in Fqt) and, if one considers the d-fold \"component-wise\" product of any d sharings, then the d-fold component-wise product of the d respective secrets is (n - t)-wise uniquely determined by it. Such schemes are a fundamental primitive in information-theoretically secure multiparty computation. Perhaps counter-intuitively, secure multi-party computation is a very powerful primitive for communication-efficient two-party cryptography, as shown recently in a series of surprising results from 2007 on. Moreover, the existence of asymptotically good arithmetic secret sharing schemes plays a crucial role in their communication-efficiency: for each d \u2265 2, if A(q) > 2d, where A(q) is Ihara's constant, then there exists an infinite family of such schemes over Fq such that n is unbounded, k = \u03a9(n) and t = \u03a9(n), as follows from a result at CRYPTO'06. Our main contribution is a novel paradigm for constructing asymptotically good arithmetic secret sharing schemes from towers of algebraic function fields. It is based on a new limit that, for a tower with a given Ihara limit and given positive integer l, gives information on the cardinality of the l-torsion sub-groups of the associated degree-zero divisor class groups and that we believe is of independent interest. As an application of the bounds we obtain, we relax the condition A(q) > 2d from the CRYPTO'06 result substantially in terms of our torsion-limit. As a consequence, this result now holds over nearly all finite fields Fq. For example, if d=2, it is sufficient that q = 8,9 or q \u2265 16.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Leiden University", "Nanyang Technological University", "CWI Amsterdam,  ... he Netherlands"], "authors": ["Ignacio Cascudo Pueyo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pueyo:Ignacio_Cascudo", "Ronald Cramer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cramer:Ronald", "Chaoping Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Chaoping"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2011", "pages": 21}
