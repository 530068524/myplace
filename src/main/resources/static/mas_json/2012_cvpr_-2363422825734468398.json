{"title": "Computing nearest-neighbor fields via Propagation-Assisted KD-Trees.", "fields": ["k d tree", "k nearest neighbors algorithm", "approximation theory", "hash function", "backtracking"], "abstract": "Matching patches between two images, also known as computing nearest-neighbor fields, has been proven a useful technique in various computer vision/graphics algorithms. But this is a computationally challenging nearest-neighbor search task, because both the query set and the candidate set are of image size. In this paper, we propose Propagation-Assisted KD-Trees to quickly compute an approximate solution. We develop a novel propagation search method for kd-trees. In this method the tree nodes checked by each query are propagated from the nearby queries. This method not only avoids the time-consuming backtracking in traditional tree methods, but is more accurate. Experiments on public data show that our method is 10\u201320 times faster than the PatchMatch method [4] at the same accuracy, or reduces its error by 70% at the same running time. Our method is also 2\u20135 times faster and is more accurate than Coherency Sensitive Hashing [22], a latest state-of-the-art method.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kaiming He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Kaiming", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian"], "pages": 8}
