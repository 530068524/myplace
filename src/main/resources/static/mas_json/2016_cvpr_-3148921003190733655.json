However, current architectures rely on siamese networks which exploit concatenation followed by further processing layers, requiring a minute of GPU computation per image pair. In contrast, in this paper we propose a matching network which is able to produce very accurate results in less than a second of GPU computation. Towards this goal, we exploit a product layer which simply computes the inner product between the two representations of a siamese architecture. We train our network by treating the problem as multi-class classification, where the classes are all possible disparities. This allows us to get calibrated scores, which result in much better matching performance when compared to existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (153)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wenjie Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Wenjie", "Alexander G.
