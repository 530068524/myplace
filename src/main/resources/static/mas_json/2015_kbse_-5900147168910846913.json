{"title": "Tool Support for Analyzing Mobile App Reviews.", "fields": ["small set", "sentiment analysis", "market research", "semantics", "mobile telephony"], "abstract": "Mobile app reviews often contain useful user opinions for app developers. However, manual analysis of those reviews is challenging due to their large volume and noisynature. This paper introduces MARK, a supporting tool for review analysis of mobile apps. With MARK, an analyst can describe her interests of one or more apps via a set of keywords. MARK then lists the reviews most relevant to those keywords for further analyses. It can also draw the trends over time of the selected keywords, which might help the analyst to detect sudden changes in the related user reviews. To help the analyst describe her interests more effectively, MARK can automatically extract and rank the keywords by their associations with negative reviews, divide a large set of keywords into more cohesive subgroups, or expand a small set into a broader one.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Utah State University", "Utah State University", "Utah State University"], "authors": ["Phong Minh Vu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vu:Phong_Minh", "Hung Viet Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Hung_Viet", "Tam The Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Tam_The", "Tung Thanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Tung_Thanh"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 6}
