These compact scene representations can then be used for accurate image-based localization, creating the need for localization approaches that are able to efficiently handle such large amounts of data. An important bottleneck is the computation of 2D-to-3D correspondences required for pose estimation. Current stateof- the-art approaches use indirect matching techniques to accelerate this search. In this paper we demonstrate that direct 2D-to-3D matching methods have a considerable potential for improving registration performance. We derive a direct matching framework based on visual vocabulary quantization and a prioritized correspondence search. Through extensive experiments, we show that our framework efficiently handles large datasets and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (306)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Torsten Sattler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sattler:Torsten", "Bastian Leibe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leibe:Bastian", "Leif Kobbelt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobbelt:Leif"], "pages": 8}
