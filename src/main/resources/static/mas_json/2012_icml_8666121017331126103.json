This link enables us to invoke convergence results from convex optimization and to consider faster alternatives for the task of approximating integrals in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We study the behavior of the different variants through numerical simulations. Our experiments shed more light on the learning bias of herding: they indicate that while we can improve over herding on the task of approximating integrals, the original herding algorithm approaches more often the maximum entropy distribution.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Francis R.
