Though this approach provides the students with some relevant practical knowledge, we believe that it is not the most appropriate way of teaching all the concepts and particularities of DSE. Thus, in this paper we report on our experience of redesigning an initial DSE course following a model-based approach. By raising the level of abstraction we gained modularity, separation of concerns and technology independence, while making the course evolve according to the latest trends in software development methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Open University of Catalonia", "University of M\u00e1laga", "University of M\u00e1laga", "University of M\u00e1laga", "University of C\u00f3rdoba"], "authors": ["Jordi Cabot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cabot:Jordi", "Francisco Dur\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dur=aacute=n:Francisco", "Nathalie Moreno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moreno:Nathalie", "Antonio Vallecillo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vallecillo:Antonio", "Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Romero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romero:Jos=eacute=_Ra=uacute=l"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
