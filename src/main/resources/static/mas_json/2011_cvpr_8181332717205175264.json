The proposed method enforces pairwise matching consistency defined on trees, and high-order constraints on all the sites of a template. The pairwise constraints admit arbitrary metrics while the high-order constraints use L1 norms and therefore can be linearized. Such a linearly augmented tree formulation introduces hyperedges and loops into the basic tree structure, but different from a general loopy graph, its special structure allows us to relax and decompose the optimization into a sequence of tree matching problems efficiently solvable by dynamic programming. The proposed method also works on continuous scale and rotation parameters; we can match with a scale up to any large number with the same efficiency. Our experiments on ground truth data and a variety of real images and videos show that the proposed method is efficient, accurate and reliable.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Boston College", "Boston University", "Boston University", "Boston College", "General Electric", "Boston University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hao Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0007:Hao", "Tai-Peng Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Tai=Peng", "Stan Sclaroff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sclaroff:Stan"], "pages": 8}
