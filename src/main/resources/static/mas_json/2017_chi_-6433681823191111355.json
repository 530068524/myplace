{"title": "Responsive Action-based Video Synthesis.", "fields": ["non linear editing system", "video editing", "video capture", "video processing", "compositing"], "abstract": "We propose technology to enable a new medium of expression, where video elements can be looped, merged, and triggered, interactively. Like audio, video is easy to sample from the real world, but hard to segment into clean reusable elements. Reusing a video clip means non-linear editing, and compositing with novel footage. The new context dictates how carefully a clip must be prepared, so our end-to-end approach enables previewing and easy iteration. We convert static-camera videos into loopable sequences, synthesizing them in response to simple end-user requests. This is hard because a) users want essentially semantic-level control over the synthesized video content, and b) automatic loop-finding is brittle and leaves users limited opportunity to work through problems. We propose a human-in-the-loop system where adding effort gives the user progressively more creative control. Artists help us evaluate how our trigger interfaces can be used for authoring of videos and video-performances.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Corneliu Ilisescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilisescu:Corneliu", "Halil Aytac Kanaci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanaci:Halil_Aytac", "Matteo Romagnoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romagnoli:Matteo", "Neill D.
