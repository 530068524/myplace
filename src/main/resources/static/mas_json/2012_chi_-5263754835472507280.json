Such controllers are especially suited to visual exploration tasks where users need to move to see details of complex visualizations. In addition, we conducted a controlled user study suggesting that tangibles make it easier for users to focus on the visual display while they interact. We explain how to build such controllers using off-the-shelf touch tablets and describe a sample application that supports multiple dynamic queries.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "departments": ["University of Paris-Sud", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Yvonne Jansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jansen:Yvonne", "Pierre Dragicevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dragicevic:Pierre", "Jean-Daniel Fekete.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fekete:Jean=Daniel"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
