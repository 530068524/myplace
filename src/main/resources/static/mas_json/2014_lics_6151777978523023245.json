This makes it a potentially attractive ingredient of computer science formalisms. In this paper we consider the extension of the two-variable fragment of first-order logic by the deterministic transitive closure of a single binary relation, and prove that the satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems for the obtained logic are decidable and ExpSpace-complete. This contrasts with the undecidability of two-variable logic with the deterministic transitive closures of several binary relations, known before. We also consider the class of universal first-order formulas in prenex form. Its various extensions by deterministic closure operations were earlier considered by other authors, leading to both decidability and undecidability results. We examine this scenario in more details.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Witold Charatonik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charatonik:Witold", "Emanuel Kieronski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kieronski:Emanuel", "Filip Mazowiecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazowiecki:Filip"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
