{"title": "Photo search by face positions and facial attributes on touch devices.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "filter", "user interface", "indexation", "icon"], "abstract": "With the explosive growth of camera devices, people can freely take photos to capture moments of life, especially the ones accompanied with friends and family. Therefore, a better solution to organize the increasing number of personal or group photos is highly required. In this paper, we propose a novel way to search for face images according facial attributes and face similarity of the target persons. To better match the face layout in mind, our system allows the user to graphically specify the face positions and sizes on a query \"canvas,\" where each attribute or identity is defined as an \"icon\" for easier representation. Moreover, we provide aesthetics filtering to enhance visual experience by removing candidates of poor photographic qualities. The scenario has been realized on a touch device with an intuitive user interface. With the proposed block-based indexing approach, we can achieve near real-time retrieval (0.1 second on average) in a large-scale dataset (more than 200k faces in Flickr images).", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Yu-Heng Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Yu=Heng", "Yan-Ying Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yan=Ying", "Lime Iida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iida:Lime", "Bor-Chun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bor=Chun", "Hsiao-Hang Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Hsiao=Hang", "Winston H.
