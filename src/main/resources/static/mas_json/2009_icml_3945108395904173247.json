In this paper we study a new aspect of the curse pertaining to the distribution of  k -occurrences, i.e., the number of times a point appears among the  k  nearest neighbors of other points in a data set. We show that, as dimensionality increases, this distribution becomes considerably skewed and hub points emerge (points with very high  k -occurrences). We examine the origin of this phenomenon, showing that it is an inherent property of high-dimensional vector space, and explore its influence on applications based on measuring distances in vector spaces, notably classification, clustering, and information retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "departments": ["University of Novi Sad", "University of Hildesheim", "University of Novi Sad"], "authors": ["Milos Radovanovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radovanovic:Milos", "Alexandros Nanopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nanopoulos:Alexandros", "Mirjana Ivanovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ivanovic:Mirjana"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
