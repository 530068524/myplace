{"title": "A Theory of Decision Making Under Dynamic Context.", "fields": ["qualitative property", "theory of computation", "random walk", "decision field theory", "machine learning"], "abstract": "The dynamics of simple decisions are well understood and modeled as a class of random walk models [e.g. 1-4]. However, most real-life decisions include a dynamically-changing influence of additional information we call context. In this work, we describe a computational theory of decision making under dynamically shifting context. We show how the model generalizes the dominant existing model of fixed-context decision making [2] and can be built up from a weighted combination of fixed-context decisions evolving simultaneously. We also show how the model generalizes recent work on the control of attention in the Flanker task [5]. Finally, we show how the model recovers qualitative data patterns in another task of longstanding psychological interest, the AX Continuous Performance Test [6], using the same model parameters.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Michael Shvartsman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shvartsman:Michael", "Vaibhav Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Vaibhav", "Jonathan D.
