{"title": "Parameterized Complexity of Optimal Planning: A Detailed Map.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "mathematics", "strips", "parameterized complexity", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "The goal of this paper is a systematic parameterized complexity analysis of different variants of propositional STRIPS planning. We identify several natural problem parameters and study all possible combinations of 9 parameters in 6 different settings. These settings arise, for instance, from the distinction if negative effects of actions are allowed or not. We provide a complete picture by establishing for each case either paraNP-hardness (i.e., the parameter combination does not help) or W[t]-completeness with t \u2208 {1, 2} (i.e., fixed-parameter intractability), or FPT (i.e., fixed-parameter tractability).", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Martin Kronegger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kronegger:Martin", "Andreas Pfandler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfandler:Andreas", "Reinhard Pichler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pichler:Reinhard"], "pages": 8}
