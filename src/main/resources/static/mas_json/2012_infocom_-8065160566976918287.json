Regenerating codes have been shown to be a more efficient way to disperse information across multiple nodes and recover crash-stop failures in the literature. In this paper, we present the design of regeneration codes in conjunction with integrity check that allows exact regeneration of failed nodes and data reconstruction in the presence of Byzantine failures. A progressive decoding mechanism is incorporated in both procedures to leverage computation performed thus far. The fault tolerance and security properties of the schemes are also analyzed.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University of Science and Technology", "University of Houston", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Yunghsiang S.
