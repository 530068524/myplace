We present a fast non-parametric statistical framework designed to analyze a large data corpus of images and semantic tag pairs and find correspondences between image characteristics and semantic concepts. We learn the relevance of different image characteristics for thousands of keywords from one million annotated images. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness with three different examples of semantic image enhancement: we adapt the gray-level tone-mapping, emphasize semantically relevant colors, and perform a defocus magnification for an image based on its semantic context. The performance of our algorithms is validated with psychophysical experiments.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Oc\u00e9 Print Logic ... , Paris, France"], "authors": ["Albrecht J.
