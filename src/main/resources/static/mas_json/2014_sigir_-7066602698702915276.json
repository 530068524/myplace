However, the latent features make it difficulty to explain the recommendation results to the users. Fortunately, with the continuous growth of online user reviews, the information available for training a recommender system is no longer limited to just numerical star ratings or user/item features. By extracting explicit user opinions about various aspects of a product from the reviews, it is possible to learn more details about what aspects a user cares, which further sheds light on the possibility to make explainable recommendations.   In this work, we propose the Explicit Factor Model (EFM) to generate explainable recommendations, meanwhile keep a high prediction accuracy. We first extract explicit product features (i.e. aspects) and user opinions by phrase-level sentiment analysis on user reviews, then generate both recommendations and disrecommendations according to the specific product features to the user's interests and the hidden features learned. Besides, intuitional feature-level explanations about why an item is or is not recommended are generated from the model. Offline experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our framework over competitive baseline algorithms on both rating prediction and top-K recommendation tasks. Online experiments show that the detailed explanations make the recommendations and disrecommendations more influential on user's purchasing behavior.", "citation": "Citations (191)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yongfeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yongfeng", "Guokun Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Guokun", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Min", "Yi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yi", "Yiqun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yiqun", "Shaoping Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shaoping"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
