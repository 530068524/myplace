Our new idea is an iterative method to identify the business logic in the code and visualize this information to gain better understanding of the logic distribution in the code, as well as developing a domain-specific business vocabulary. This new method combines and extends several existing technologies, including search, aggregation, and visualization. We evaluated the visualization method on a large-scale application and found that it yields useful results, provided an appropriate vocabulary is available.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Yael Dubinsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dubinsky:Yael", "Yishai A.
