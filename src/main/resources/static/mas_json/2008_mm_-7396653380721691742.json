For a given photo cluster, near-duplicate photo pairs are first determined, and the relationships between them are modeled by a graph. The most typical one is then automatically selected by examining the mutual relation between them. For smart thumbnailing, we determine the region-of-interest of the selected representative photo based on locally matched feature points, which is a view different from conventional saliency-based approaches. The experiments show satisfactory performance in representative selection and promising results in ROI determination.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["National Chung Cheng University", "National Chung Cheng University"], "authors": ["Wei-Ta Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Wei=Ta", "Chia-Hung Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chia=Hung"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
