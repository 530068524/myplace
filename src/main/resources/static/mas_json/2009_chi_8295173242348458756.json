This experimental study addresses gaps in our current theoretical understanding of the impact of \u00b1Gz accelerations and field dependency independency on task performance in human-computer interaction. It investigates the effects of \u00b1Gz accelerations and field dependency independency on human performance in the completion of perceptual-motor tasks on a personal digital assistant (PDA). We report the results of a controlled experiment, conducted in an aerobatic aircraft under multiple \u00b1Gz conditions, showing that cognitive style significantly impacts latency and accuracy in target acquisition for perceptual-motor tasks in altered \u00b1Gz environments and propose design guidelines as countermeasures. Based on the results, we argue that developing design requirements taking into account cognitive differences in extreme environments will allow users to execute perceptual-motor tasks efficiently without unnecessarily increasing cognitive load and the probability of critical errors.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Copenhagen Business School", "University of H ... nolulu, HI, USA"], "authors": ["Marc A.
