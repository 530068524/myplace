Considering the temporally ordinal and continuous characteristic of aging process, the proposed method not only aims at preserving the local manifold structure of facial images, but also it wants to keep the ordinal information among aging faces. Moreover, we try to remove redundant information from both the locality information and ordinal information as much as possible by minimizing nonlinear correlation and rank correlation. Finally, we formulate these two issues into a unified optimization problem of feature selection and present an efficient solution. The experiments are conducted on the public available Images of Groups dataset and the FG-NET dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the power of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Changsheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Changsheng", "Qingshan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Qingshan", "Jing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Jing", "Hanqing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hanqing"], "pages": 8}
