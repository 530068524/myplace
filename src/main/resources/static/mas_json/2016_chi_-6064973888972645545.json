{"title": "ShapeCanvas: An Exploration of Shape-Changing Content Generation by Members of the Public.", "fields": ["physical design", "multimedia", "grid", "pixel", "channel"], "abstract": "Shape-changing displays - visual output surfaces with physically-reconfigurable geometry - provide new challenges for content generation. Content design must incorporate visual elements, physical surface shape, react to user input, and adapt these parameters over time. The addition of the 'shape channel' significantly increases the complexity of content design, but provides a powerful platform for novel physical design, animations, and physicalizations. In this work we use ShapeCanvas, a 4\u00d74 grid of large actuated pixels, combined with simple interactions, to explore novice user behavior and interactions for shape-change content design. We deployed ShapeCanvas in a cafe for two and a half days and observed users generate 21 physical animations. These were categorized into seven categories and eight directly derived from people's personal interest. This paper describes these experiences, the generated animations and provides initial insights into shape-changing content design.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Aluna Everitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Everitt:Aluna", "Faisal Taher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taher:Faisal", "Jason Alexander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alexander:Jason"], "pages": 5}
