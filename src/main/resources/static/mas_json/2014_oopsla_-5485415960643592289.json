{"title": "Confined gradual typing.", "fields": ["typing", "programming language", "gradual typing", "smalltalk", "strong and weak typing"], "abstract": "Gradual typing combines static and dynamic typing flexibly and safely in a single programming language. To do so, gradually typed languages implicitly insert casts where needed, to ensure at runtime that typing assumptions are not violated by untyped code. However, the implicit nature of cast insertion, especially on higher-order values, can jeopardize reliability and efficiency: higher-order casts can fail at any time, and are costly to execute. We propose Confined Gradual Typing, which extends gradual typing with two new type qualifiers that let programmers control the flow of values between the typed and the untyped worlds, and thereby trade some flexibility for more reliability and performance. We formally develop two variants of Confined Gradual Typing that capture different flexibility/guarantee tradeoffs. We report on the implementation of Confined Gradual Typing in Gradualtalk, a gradually-typed Smalltalk, which confirms the performance advantage of avoiding unwanted higher-order casts and the low overhead of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Chile", "University of Chile", "University of British Columbia", "University of Chile"], "authors": ["Esteban Allende.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Allende:Esteban", "Johan Fabry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fabry:Johan", "Ronald Garcia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia:Ronald", "\u00c9ric Tanter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanter:=Eacute=ric"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2014", "pages": 20}
