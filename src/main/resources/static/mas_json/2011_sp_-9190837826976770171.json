{"title": "Click Trajectories: End-to-End Analysis of the Spam Value Chain.", "fields": ["merchant services", "blacklisting", "forum spam", "end to end principle", "spambot"], "abstract": "Spam-based advertising is a business. While it has engendered both widespread antipathy and a multi-billion dollar anti-spam industry, it continues to exist because it fuels a profitable enterprise. We lack, however, a solid understanding of this enterprise's full structure, and thus most anti-Spam interventions focus on only one facet of the overall spam value chain (e.g., spam filtering, URL blacklisting, site takedown).In this paper we present a holistic analysis that quantifies the full set of resources employed to monetize spam email -- including naming, hosting, payment and fulfillment -- usingextensive measurements of three months of diverse spam data, broad crawling of naming and hosting infrastructures, and over 100 purchases from spam-advertised sites. We relate these resources to the organizations who administer them and then use this data to characterize the relative prospects for defensive interventions at each link in the spam value chain. In particular, we provide the first strong evidence of payment bottlenecks in the spam value chain, 95% of spam-advertised pharmaceutical, replica and software products are monetized using merchant services from just a handful of banks.", "citation": "Citations (250)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics"], "authors": ["Kirill Levchenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levchenko:Kirill", "Andreas Pitsillidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitsillidis:Andreas", "Neha Chachra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chachra:Neha", "Brandon Enright.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Enright:Brandon", "M\u00e1rk F\u00e9legyh\u00e1zi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/F=eacute=legyh=aacute=zi:M=aacute=rk", "Chris Grier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grier:Chris", "Tristan Halvorson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halvorson:Tristan", "Chris Kanich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanich:Chris", "Christian Kreibich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kreibich:Christian", "He Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:He", "Damon McCoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McCoy:Damon", "Nicholas Weaver.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weaver:Nicholas", "Vern Paxson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paxson:Vern", "Geoffrey M.
