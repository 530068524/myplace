{"title": "A mechanized semantics for C++ object construction and destruction, with applications to resource management.", "fields": ["finalizer", "system programming", "multiple inheritance", "operational semantics", "run time type information"], "abstract": "We present a formal operational semantics and its Coq mechanization for the C++ object model, featuring object construction and destruction, shared and repeated multiple inheritance, and virtual function call dispatch. These are key C++ language features for high-level system programming, in particular for predictable and reliable resource management. This paper is the first to present a formal mechanized account of the metatheory of construction and destruction in C++, and applications to popular programming techniques such as \"resource acquisition is initialization\". We also report on irregularities and apparent contradictions in the ISO C++03 and C++11 standards.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Texas A&M University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Tahina Ramananandro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramananandro:Tahina", "Gabriel Dos Reis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reis:Gabriel_Dos", "Xavier Leroy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leroy:Xavier"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
