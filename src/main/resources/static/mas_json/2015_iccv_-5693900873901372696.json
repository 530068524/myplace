{"title": "Bayesian Non-parametric Inference for Manifold Based MoCap Representation.", "fields": ["principal geodesic analysis", "manifold", "subspace topology", "dirichlet process", "motion capture"], "abstract": "We propose a novel approach to human action recognition, with motion capture data (MoCap), based on grouping sub-body parts. By representing configurations of actions as manifolds, joint positions are mapped on a subspace via principal geodesic analysis. The reduced space is still highly informative and allows for classification based on a non-parametric Bayesian approach, generating behaviors for each sub-body part. Having partitioned the set of joints, poses relative to a sub-body part are exchangeable, given a specified prior and can elicit, in principle, infinite behaviors. The generation of these behaviors is specified by a Dirichlet process mixture. We show with several experiments that the recognition gives very promising results, outperforming methods requiring temporal alignment.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Fabrizio Natola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Natola:Fabrizio", "Valsamis Ntouskos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ntouskos:Valsamis", "Marta Sanzari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanzari:Marta", "Fiora Pirri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pirri:Fiora"], "pages": 9}
