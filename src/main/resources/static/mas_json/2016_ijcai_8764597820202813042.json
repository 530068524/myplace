The Hungarian algorithm is the most commonly used online MOT data association method due to its rapid assignment; however, the Hungarian algorithm simply considers associations based on an affinity model. For crowded scenarios, frequently occurring interactions between objects complicate associations, and affinity-based methods usually fail in these scenarios. Here we introduce quadratic pseudo-Boolean optimization (QPBO) to an online MOT model to analyze frequent interactions. Specifically, we formulate two useful interaction types as pairwise potentials in QPBO, a design that benefits our model by exploiting informative interactions and allowing our online tracker to handle complex scenes. The auxiliary interactions result in a non-submodular QPBO, so we accelerate our online tracker by solving the model with a graph cut combined with a simple heuristic method. This combination achieves a reasonable local optimum and, importantly, implements the tracker efficiently. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets from both static and moving cameras demonstrate the superiority of our method.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["National University of Defense Technology", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney", "National University of Defense Technology", "National University of Defense Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Long Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Long", "Dacheng Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Dacheng", "Chen Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Chen", "Naiyang Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Naiyang", "Zhigang Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Zhigang"], "pages": 7}
