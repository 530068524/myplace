Most existing methods exploit feature points and planes from images. Lines have always been considered notorious for both matching and reconstruction due to the lack of good line descriptors. We propose a method to generate and match new points using virtual lines constructed using pairs of keypoints, which are obtained using standard feature point detectors. We use cross-ratio constraints to obtain an initial set of new point matches, which are subsequently used to obtain line correspondences. We develop a method that works for both calibrated and uncalibrated camera configurations. We show compelling line-matching and large-scale 3D reconstruction.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories", "University of Luxembourg", "Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories", "Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Srikumar Ramalingam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramalingam:Srikumar", "Michel Antunes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antunes:Michel", "Daniel Snow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snow:Daniel", "Gim Hee Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Gim_Hee", "Sudeep Pillai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pillai:Sudeep"], "pages": 9}
