{"title": "Thurstonian Boltzmann Machines: Learning from Multiple Inequalities.", "fields": ["realisation", "categorical variable", "thurstonian model", "ordinal number", "collaborative filtering"], "abstract": "We introduce Thurstonian Boltzmann Machines (TBM), a unified architecture that can naturally incorporate a wide range of data inputs at the same time. Our motivation rests in the Thurstonian view that many discrete data types can be considered as being generated from a subset of underlying latent continuous variables, and in the observation that each realisation of a discrete type imposes certain inequalities on those variables. Thus learning and inference in TBM reduce to making sense of a set of inequalities. Our proposed TBM naturally supports the following types: Gaussian, intervals, censored, binary, categorical, muticategorical, ordinal, (in)-complete rank with and without ties. We demonstrate the versatility and capacity of the proposed model on three applications of very different natures; namely handwritten digit recognition, collaborative filtering and complex social survey analysis.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Deakin University", "Curtin University", "Deakin University", "Deakin University"], "authors": ["Truyen Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran_0001:Truyen", "Dinh Q.
