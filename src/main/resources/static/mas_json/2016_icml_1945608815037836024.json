{"title": "A New PAC-Bayesian Perspective on Domain Adaptation.", "fields": ["domain adaptation", "divergence", "transfer of learning", "source data", "statistical learning theory"], "abstract": "We study the issue of PAC-Bayesian domain adaptation: We want to learn, from a source domain, a majority vote model dedicated to a target one. Our theoretical contribution brings a new perspective by deriving an upper-bound on the target risk where the distributions' divergence-- expressed as a ratio--controls the trade-off between a source error measure and the target voters' disagreement. Our bound suggests that one has to focus on regions where the source data is informative. From this result, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound, and specialize it to linear classifiers. Then, we infer a learning algorithm and perform experiments on real data.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Laval University", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Pascal Germain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Germain:Pascal", "Amaury Habrard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habrard:Amaury", "Fran\u00e7ois Laviolette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laviolette:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Emilie Morvant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morvant:Emilie"], "pages": 10}
