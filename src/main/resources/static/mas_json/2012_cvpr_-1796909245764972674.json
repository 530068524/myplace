{"title": "On SIFTs and their scales.", "fields": ["template matching", "scale space", "scale invariant feature transform", "linear subspace", "scale invariance"], "abstract": "Scale invariant feature detectors often find stable scales in only a few image pixels. Consequently, methods for feature matching typically choose one of two extreme options: matching a sparse set of scale invariant features, or dense matching using arbitrary scales. In this paper we turn our attention to the overwhelming majority of pixels, those where stable scales are not found by standard techniques. We ask, is scale-selection necessary for these pixels, when dense, scale-invariant matching is required and if so, how can it be achieved? We make the following contributions: (i) We show that features computed over different scales, even in low-contrast areas, can be different; selecting a single scale, arbitrarily or otherwise, may lead to poor matches when the images have different scales. (ii) We show that representing each pixel as a set of SIFTs, extracted at multiple scales, allows for far better matches than single-scale descriptors, but at a computational price. Finally, (iii) we demonstrate that each such set may be accurately represented by a low-dimensional, linear subspace. A subspace-to-point mapping may further be used to produce a novel descriptor representation, the Scale-Less SIFT (SLS), as an alternative to single-scale descriptors. These claims are verified by quantitative and qualitative tests, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Open University of Israel", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tal Hassner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassner:Tal", "Viki Mayzels.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayzels:Viki", "Lihi Zelnik-Manor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zelnik=Manor:Lihi"], "pages": 7}
