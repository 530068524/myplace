In particular, we can use and construct objects of homotopy theory and reason about them using higher inductive types. In this article, we construct the real projective spaces, key players in homotopy theory, as certain higher inductive types in homotopy type theory. The classical definition of \u211dP n , as the quotient space identifying antipodal points of the n-sphere, does not translate directly to homotopy type theory. Instead, we define \u211dP n  by induction on n simultaneously with its tautological bundle of 2-element sets. As the base case, we take \u211dP \u22121  to be the empty type. In the inductive step, we take \u211dP n+1  to be the mapping cone of the projection map of the tautological bundle of \u211dP n , and we use its universal property and the univalence axiom to define the tautological bundle on \u211dP n+1 .", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Ulrik Buchholtz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buchholtz:Ulrik", "Egbert Rijke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rijke:Egbert"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
