However, there are still some FE for certain predicates to which dual system encryption techniques seem inapplicable, and hence their fully-secure realization remains an important problem. A notable example is FE for regular languages, introduced by Waters in Crypto\u201912.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Nuttapong Attrapadung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Attrapadung:Nuttapong"], "pages": 21}
