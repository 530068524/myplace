Both exact and approximate methods are developed. The exact method combines mixed integer linear programming formulations for structure learning and treewidth computation. The approximate method consists in sampling k-trees (maximal graphs of treewidth k), and subsequently selecting, exactly or approximately, the best structure whose moral graph is a subgraph of that k-tree. The approaches are empirically compared to each other and to state-of-the-art methods on a collection of public data sets with up to 100 variables.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "Queen's University Belfast", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Siqi Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Siqi", "Denis Deratani Mau\u00e1.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mau=aacute=:Denis_Deratani", "Cassio Polpo de Campos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Campos:Cassio_Polpo_de", "Qiang Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Qiang"], "pages": 9}
