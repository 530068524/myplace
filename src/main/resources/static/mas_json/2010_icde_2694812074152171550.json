{"title": "Efficient similarity matching of Time Series Cliques with natural relations.", "fields": ["group method of data handling", "matrix decomposition", "nearest neighbor search", "application software", "clique"], "abstract": "A Time Series Clique (TSC) consists of multiple time series. In each TSC, the time series hold some natural relations with each other. In conventional time series retrieval methods, such natural relations are often ignored. In this paper, we formalize the problem of similarity search over TSC databases and develop a novel framework for similarity search on TSC data, which considers both time series patterns and relations. We conduct an extensive performance study, and the results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Microsoft", "Electric Power Research Institute"], "authors": ["Zhe Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Zhe", "Bin Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui_0001:Bin", "Wee Hyong Tok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tok:Wee_Hyong", "Jiakui Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Jiakui"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
