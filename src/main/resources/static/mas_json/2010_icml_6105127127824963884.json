{"title": "One-sided Support Vector Regression for Multiclass Cost-sensitive Classification.", "fields": ["relevance vector machine", "statistical classification", "classification rule", "support vector machine", "structured support vector machine"], "abstract": "We propose a novel approach that reduces cost-sensitive classification to one-sided regression. The approach stores the cost information in the regression labels and encodes the minimum-cost prediction with the onesided loss. The simple approach is accompanied by a solid theoretical guarantee of error transformation, and can be used to cast any one-sided regression method as a cost-sensitive classification algorithm. To validate the proposed reduction approach, we design a new cost-sensitive classification algorithm by coupling the approach with a variant of the support vector machine (SVM) for one-sided regression. The proposed algorithm can be viewed as a theoretically justified extension of the popular one-versus-all SVM. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is not only superior to traditional one-versus-all SVM for cost-sensitive classification, but also better than many existing SVM-based cost-sensitive classification algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Han-Hsing Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Han=Hsing", "Hsuan-Tien Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Hsuan=Tien"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
