{"title": "Manifold Integration with Markov Random Walks.", "fields": ["atlas", "simplicial manifold", "closed manifold", "hilbert manifold", "manifold alignment"], "abstract": "Most manifold learning methods consider only one similarity matrix to induce a low-dimensional manifold embedded in data space. In practice, however, we often use multiple sensors at a time so that each sensory information yields different similarity matrix derived from the same objects. In such a case, manifold integration is a desirable task, combining these similarity matrices into a compromise matrix that faithfully reflects multiple sensory information. A small number of methods exists for manifold integration, including a method based on reproducing kernel Krein space (RKKS) or DISTATIS, where the former is restricted to the case of only two manifolds and the latter considers a linear combination of normalized similarity matrices as a compromise matrix. In this paper we present a new manifold integration method, Markov random walk on multiple manifolds (RAMS), which integrates transition probabilities defined on each manifold to compute a compromise matrix. Numerical experiments confirm that RAMS finds more informative manifolds with a desirable projection property.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Heeyoul Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Heeyoul", "Seungjin Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Seungjin", "Yoonsuck Choe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choe:Yoonsuck"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
