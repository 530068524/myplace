We present SCHBASE, a hierarchical database of keyphrases extracted from large collections of scientific literature. SCHBASE relies on a tendency of scientists to generate new abbreviations that \u201cextend\u201d existing forms as a form of signaling novelty. We demonstrate how these keyphrases/concepts can be extracted, and their viability as a database in relation to existing collections. We further show how keyphrases can be placed into a semantically-meaningful \u201cphylogenetic\u201d structure and describe key features of this structure.
