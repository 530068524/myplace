{"title": "ReNew: A Semi-Supervised Framework for Generating Domain-Specific Lexicons and Sentiment Analysis.", "fields": ["data mining", "sentiment analysis", "lexicon", "natural language processing", "social media"], "abstract": "The sentiment captured in opinionated text provides interesting and valuable information for social media services. However, due to the complexity and diversity of linguistic representations, it is challenging to build a framework that accurately extracts such sentiment. We propose a semi-supervised framework for generating a domain-specific sentiment lexicon and inferring sentiments at the segment level. Our framework can greatly reduce the human effort for building a domainspecific sentiment lexicon with high quality. Specifically, in our evaluation, working with just 20 manually labeled reviews, it generates a domain-specific sentiment lexicon that yields weighted average FMeasure gains of 3%. Our sentiment classification model achieves approximately 1% greater accuracy than a state-of-the-art approach based on elementary discourse units.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhe Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhe", "Munindar P.
