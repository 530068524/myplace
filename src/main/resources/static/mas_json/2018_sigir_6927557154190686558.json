{"title": "Modeling Mobile User Actions for Purchase Recommendation using Deep Memory Networks.", "fields": ["operator", "empirical research", "data mining", "mobile device", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Rapid expansion of mobile devices has brought an unprecedented opportunity for mobile operators and content publishers to reach many users at any point in time. Understanding usage patterns of mobile applications (apps) is an integral task that precedes advertising efforts of providing relevant recommendations to users. However, this task can be very arduous due to the unstructured nature of app data, with sparseness in available information. This study proposes a novel approach to learn representations of mobile user actions using Deep Memory Networks. We validate the proposed approach on millions of app usage sessions built from large scale feeds of mobile app events and mobile purchase receipts. The empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach performed better compared to several competitive baselines in terms of recommendation precision quality. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study analyzing app usage patterns for purchase recommendation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Temple University", "Temple University", "Facebook", "Temple University", "Airbnb, San Francisco, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Djordje Gligorijevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gligorijevic:Djordje", "Jelena Gligorijevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gligorijevic:Jelena", "Aravindan Raghuveer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghuveer:Aravindan", "Mihajlo Grbovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grbovic:Mihajlo", "Zoran Obradovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Obradovic:Zoran"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
