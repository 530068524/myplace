We show that the linear matroid intersection problem is in quasi-NC 2 . That is, it has uniform circuits of quasi-polynomial size  n   O (log n ) , and  O (log 2   n ) depth. This generalizes the similar result for the bipartite perfect matching problem. We do this by an almost complete derandomization of the Isolation lemma for matroid intersection.   Our result also implies a blackbox singularity test for symbolic matrices of the form  A  0 + A  1   z  1  + A  2   z  2 + \u00e2 \ufffd+ A   m    z   m  , where  A  0  is an arbitrary matrix and the matrices  A  1 , A  2 ,\u00e2 \ufffd, A   m   are of rank 1 over some field.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Aalen University, Germany"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Rohit Gurjar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurjar:Rohit", "Thomas Thierauf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thierauf:Thomas"], "pages": 10}
