This is done by a multi-label representation of the flow field, where each label corresponds to a parametric representation of the motion. We use a convex formulation of the multi-label Potts model with label costs and show that the asymmetric map-uniqueness criterion can be integrated into our formulation by means of convex constraints. Explicit occlusion handling eliminates errors otherwise created by the regularization. As occlusions can occur only at object boundaries, a large number of objects may be required. By using a fast primal-dual algorithm we are able to handle several hundred motion segments. Results are shown on several classical motion segmentation and optical flow examples.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology", "Graz University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Markus Unger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unger:Markus", "Manuel Werlberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Werlberger:Manuel", "Thomas Pock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pock:Thomas", "Horst Bischof.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischof:Horst"], "pages": 8}
