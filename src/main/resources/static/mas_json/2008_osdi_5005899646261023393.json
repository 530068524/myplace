{"title": "Avoiding File System Micromanagement with Range Writes.", "fields": ["self certifying file system", "versioning file system", "unix file types", "file control block", "file system fragmentation"], "abstract": "We introduce range writes, a simple but powerful change to the disk interface that removes the need for file system micromanagement of block placement. By allowing a file system to specify a set of possible address targets, range writes enable the disk to choose the final on-disk location of the request; the disk improves performance by writing to the closest location and subsequently reporting its choice to the file system above. The result is a clean separation of responsibility; the file system (as high-level manager) provides coarse-grained control over placement, while the disk (as low-level worker) makes the final fine-grained placement decision to improve write performance. We show the benefits of range writes through numerous simulations and a prototype implementation, in some cases improving performance by a factor of three across both synthetic and real workloads.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Ashok Anand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anand:Ashok", "Sayandeep Sen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sen:Sayandeep", "Andrew Krioukov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krioukov:Andrew", "Florentina I.
