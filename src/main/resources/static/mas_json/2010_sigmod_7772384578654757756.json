In this paper, we study the problem of how to use MCDB to answer statistical queries that search for database objects which satisfy some filter condition with greater (or less than) a user-specified probability. For example: \"Which packages will arrive late with > 5% probability?\" \"Which regions will see more than a 2% decline in sales with > 50% probability?\" \"What items will be out of stock by Friday with > 20% probability?\" We consider both the systems aspects and the statistical aspects of the problem.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Rice University", "University of Florida", "Rice University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Luis Leopoldo Perez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perez:Luis_Leopoldo", "Subi Arumugam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arumugam:Subi", "Christopher M.
