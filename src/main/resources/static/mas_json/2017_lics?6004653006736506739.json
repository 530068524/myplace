The abstract lattice is finite and has the following key properties. (i) There is a Galois insertion between it and the lattice of languages of finite and infinite words over a given alphabet. (ii) The abstraction is faithful with respect to acceptance by the automaton. (iii) Least fixpoints and \u03c9-iterations (but not in general greatest fixpoints) can be computed on the level of the abstract lattice.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "authors": ["Florent Capelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capelli:Florent"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
