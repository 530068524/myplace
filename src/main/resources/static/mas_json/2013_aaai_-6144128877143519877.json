{"title": "OpenEval: Web Information Query Evaluation.", "fields": ["predicate", "web page", "small number", "f1 score", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate information validation tasks that are initiated as queries from either automated agents or humans. We introduce OpenEval, a new online information validation technique, which uses information on the web to automatically evaluate the truth of queries that are stated as multiargument predicate instances (e.g., DrugHasSideEffect(Aspirin, GI Bleeding))). OpenEval gets a small number of instances of a predicate as seed positive examples and automatically learns how to evaluate the truth of a new predicate instance by querying the web and processing the retrieved unstructured web pages. We show that OpenEval is able to respond to the queries within a limited amount of time while also achieving high F1 score. In addition, we show that the accuracy of responses provided by OpenEval is increased as more time is given for evaluation. We have extensively tested our model and shown empirical results that illustrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to related techniques.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Mehdi Samadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samadi:Mehdi", "Manuela M.
