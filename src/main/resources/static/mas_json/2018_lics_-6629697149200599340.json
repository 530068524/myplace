Based on an algebraic characterization by Bojanczyk, et. al., (2012) in terms of forest algebras, Straubing (2013) described an approach to PDL based on a k-fold iterated distributive law. A proof that all languages satisfying such a k-fold iterated distributive law are in PDL would settle decidability of PDL. We solve this problem in the case k = 2: All languages recognized by forest algebras satisfying a 2-fold iterated distributive law are in PDL. Furthermore, we show that this class is decidable. This provides a novel nontrivial decidable subclass of PDL, and demonstrates the viability of the proposed approach to deciding PDL in general.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "University of T\u00fcbingen", "Boston College"], "authors": ["Michael Hahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hahn_0001:Michael", "Andreas Krebs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krebs:Andreas", "Howard Straubing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Straubing:Howard"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
