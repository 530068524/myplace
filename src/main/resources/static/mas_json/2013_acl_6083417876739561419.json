Additionally, we also propose a new MT metric to appropriately evaluate the translation quality of informative words, by assigning different weights to different words according to their importance values in a document. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on enhancing the quality of overall translation, name translation and word alignment over a high-quality MT baseline 1 .", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["City University of New York", "SRI International", "City University of New York", "City University of New York", "SRI International"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Haibo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0004:Haibo", "Jing Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Jing", "Heng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Heng", "Qi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0014:Qi", "Wen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Wen"], "pages": 11}
