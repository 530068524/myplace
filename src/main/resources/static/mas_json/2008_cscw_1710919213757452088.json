{"title": "The language of emotion in short blog texts.", "fields": ["text mining", "affect", "content analysis", "emotion perception", "communication"], "abstract": "Emotion is central to human interactions, and automatic detection could enhance our experience with technologies. We investigate the linguistic expression of fine-grained emotion in 50 and 200 word samples of real blog texts previously coded by expert and naive raters. Content analysis (LIWC) reveals angry authors use more affective language and negative affect words, and that joyful authors use more positive affect words. Additionally, a co-occurrence semantic space approach (LSA) was able to identify fear (which naive human emotion raters could not do). We relate our findings to human emotion perception and note potential computational applications.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "University of Burgundy", "Northwestern University", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Alastair J.
