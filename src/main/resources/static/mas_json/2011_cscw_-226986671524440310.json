In this paper, we present the results of a pilot study comparing time management behaviors of Germans, Chinese and Japanese. The results revealed that Germans and Japanese use time management mechanics and goal setting and priorities more frequently than Chinese. Japanese and Chinese have higher preference for organization than Germans. All three groups use more time management mechanics than goal setting and priorities. The implications for time management system design were discussed.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "ETH Zurich", "Chuo University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Pei-Luen Patrick Rau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rau:Pei=Luen_Patrick", "Jun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0016:Jun", "Stephan Verhasselt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verhasselt:Stephan", "Toshikazu Kato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kato:Toshikazu", "Christopher M.
