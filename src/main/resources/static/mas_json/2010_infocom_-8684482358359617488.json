We consider a MANET that consists of $n_s$ multicast sessions. Each multicast session has one source and $p$ destinations. Each source sends identical information to the $p$ destinations in its multicast session, and the information is required to be delivered to all the $p$ destinations within $D$ time-slots. Assuming the wireless mobiles move according to a two-dimensional i.i.d. mobility model, we first prove that the capacity per multicast session is $O\\left(\\min\\left\\{1, (\\log p)(\\log \\left(n_sp\\right)) \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{n_s}}\\right\\}\\right).$ We then propose a joint coding/scheduling algorithm achieving a throughput of $\\Theta\\left(\\min\\left\\{1,\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{n_s}}\\right\\}\\right).$ Our simulation results suggest that the same scaling law also holds under random walk and random waypoint models.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Shan Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Shan", "Lei Ying.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ying:Lei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
