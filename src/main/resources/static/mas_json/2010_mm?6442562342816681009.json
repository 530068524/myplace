MOGCLASS includes various features for students to enhance their motivation, interest, and collaboration in music class. It provides a wide-ranging palette of easy-to-use musical instruments for students to choose from, and supports both collaborative silent practice with headphones, and collaborative performance with loudspeakers. To facilitate classroom management, the teacher's interface is used to control students' activities. Our evaluation results indicate that MOGCLASS is effective in increasing students' motivation in learning music and in supporting teachers' classroom management", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yinsheng Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yinsheng", "Graham Percival.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Percival:Graham", "Xinxi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinxi", "Ye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ye", "Shengdong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shengdong"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
