{"title": "Supervised learning for provenance-similarity of binaries.", "fields": ["source code", "executable", "supervised learning", "malware", "compiler"], "abstract": "Understanding, measuring, and leveraging the similarity of binaries (executable code) is a foundational challenge in software engineering. We present a notion of similarity based on provenance -- two binaries are similar if they are compiled from the same (or very similar) source code with the same (or similar) compilers. Empirical evidence suggests that provenance-similarity accounts for a significant portion of variation in existing binaries, particularly in malware. We propose and evaluate the applicability of classification to detect provenance-similarity. We evaluate a variety of classifiers, and different types of attributes and similarity labeling schemes, on two benchmarks derived from open-source software and malware respectively. We present encouraging results indicating that classification is a viable approach for automated provenance-similarity detection, and as an aid for malware analysts in particular.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Software Engineering Institute", "Software Engineering Institute", "Software Engineering Institute"], "authors": ["Sagar Chaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaki:Sagar", "Cory F.
