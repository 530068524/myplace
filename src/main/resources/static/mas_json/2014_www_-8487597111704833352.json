In this paper, we analyze the group activities of users in Aion, one of the largest MMORPGs, based on the records of the activities of 94,497 users. In particular, we focus on (i) how social interactions within a group differ from the ones across groups, (ii) what makes a group rise, sustain, or fall, (iii) how group members join and leave a group, and (iv) what makes a group end. We first find that structural patterns of social interactions within a group are more likely to be close-knit and reciprocative than the ones across groups. We also observe that members in a rising group (i.e., the number of members increases) are more cohesive, and communicate with more evenly within the group than the ones in other groups. Our analysis further reveals that if a group is not cohesive, not actively communicating, or not evenly communicating among members, members of the group tend to leave.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Korea University"], "authors": ["Taejoong Chung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chung:Taejoong", "Jinyoung Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jinyoung", "Daejin Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Daejin", "Ted Taekyoung Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Ted_Taekyoung", "Huy Kang Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Huy_Kang", "Yanghee Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Yanghee"], "conf": "www", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
