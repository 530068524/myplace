{"title": "Lower bounds for depth 4 formulas computing iterated matrix multiplication.", "fields": ["homogeneous", "random variate", "combinatorics", "discrete mathematics", "iterated function", "polynomial", "mathematics", "matrix multiplication", "multilinear map"], "abstract": "We study the arithmetic complexity of iterated matrix multiplication. We show that any multilinear homogeneous depth 4 arithmetic formula computing the product of  d  generic matrices of size  n  \u00d7  n , IMM  n,d  , has size  n  \u03a9(\u221a d )  as long as  d  =  n   O (1) . This improves the result of Nisan and Wigderson (Computational Complexity, 1997) for depth 4 set-multilinear formulas.   We also study \u03a3\u03a0 [ O ( d / t )]  \u03a3\u03a0 [ t ]  formulas, which are depth 4 formulas with the stated bounds on the fan-ins of the \u03a0 gates. A recent depth reduction result of Tavenas (MFCS, 2013) shows that any  n -variate degree  d  =  n   O (1)  polynomial computable by a circuit of size poly( n ) can also be computed by a depth 4 \u03a3\u03a0 [ O ( d / t )]  \u03a3\u03a0 [ t ]  formula of top fan-in  n   O ( d / t ) . We show that any such formula computing IMM  n,d   has top fan-in  n  \u03a9( d / t ) , proving the optimality of Tavenas' result. This also strengthens a result of Kayal, Saha, and Saptharishi (ECCC, 2013) which gives a similar lower bound for an explicit polynomial in VNP.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Institut de Mat ... , Paris, France", "Institut de Mat ... , Paris, France"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Herv\u00e9 Fournier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fournier:Herv=eacute=", "Nutan Limaye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Limaye:Nutan", "Guillaume Malod.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malod:Guillaume", "Srikanth Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan_0001:Srikanth"], "pages": 8}
