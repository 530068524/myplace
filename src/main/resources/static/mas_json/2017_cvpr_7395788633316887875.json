{"title": "ROAM: A Rich Object Appearance Model with Application to Rotoscoping.", "fields": ["minification", "initialization", "machine learning", "active appearance model", "parametric equation"], "abstract": "Rotoscoping, the detailed delineation of scene elements through a video shot, is a painstaking task of tremendous importance in professional post-production pipelines. While pixel-wise segmentation techniques can help for this task, professional rotoscoping tools rely on parametric curves that offer the artists a much better interactive control on the definition, editing and manipulation of the segments of interest. Sticking to this prevalent rotoscoping paradigm, we propose a novel framework to capture and track the visual aspect of an arbitrary object in a scene, given a first closed outline of this object. This model combines a collection of local foreground/background appearance models spread along the outline, a global appearance model of the enclosed object and a set of distinctive foreground landmarks. The structure of this rich appearance model allows simple initialization, efficient iterative optimization with exact minimization at each step, and on-line adaptation in videos. We demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively the merit of this framework through comparisons with tools based on either dynamic segmentation with a closed curve or pixel-wise binary labelling.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Technicolor", "University of Oxford", "Technicolor"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ondrej Miksik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miksik:Ondrej", "Juan-Manuel Perez-Rua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perez=Rua:Juan=Manuel", "Philip H.
