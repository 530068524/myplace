{"title": "A Logic for Coalitions with Bounded Resources.", "fields": ["multimodal logic", "interval temporal logic", "intermediate logic", "zeroth order logic", "bunched logic"], "abstract": "Recent work on Alternating-Time Temporal Logic and Coalition Logic has allowed the expression of many interesting properties of coalitions and strategies. However there is no natural way of expressing resource requirements in these logics. This paper presents a Resource-Bounded Coalition Logic (RBCL) which has explicit representation of resource bounds in the language, and gives a complete and sound axiomatisation of RBCL.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Natasha Alechina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alechina:Natasha", "Brian Logan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Logan:Brian", "Nguyen Hoang Nga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nga:Nguyen_Hoang", "Abdur Rakib.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rakib:Abdur"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
