{"title": "Object Flow Integrity.", "fields": ["component object model", "counterfeit", "method", "scalability", "object exchange"], "abstract": "Object flow integrity (OFI) augments control-flow integrity (CFI) and software fault isolation (SFI) protections with secure, first-class support for binary object exchange across inter-module trust boundaries. This extends both source-aware and source-free CFI and SFI technologies to a large class of previously unsupported software: those containing immutable system modules with large, object-oriented APIs---which are particularly common in component-based, event-driven consumer software. It also helps to protect these inter-module object exchanges against confused deputy-assisted vtable corruption and counterfeit object-oriented programming attacks.   A prototype implementation for Microsoft Component Object Model demonstrates that OFI is scalable to large interfaces on the order of tens of thousands of methods, and exhibits low overheads of under 1% for some common-case applications. Significant elements of the implementation are synthesized automatically through a principled design inspired by type-based contracts.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Wenhao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wenhao", "Xiaoyang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Xiaoyang", "Kevin W.
