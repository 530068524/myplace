This paper shows that such an approach can yield an implementation that is competitive with hand-optimized libraries, and describes the software structure that makes our current FFTW3 version flexible and adaptive. We further discuss a new algorithm for real-data DFTs of prime size, a new way of implementing DFTs by means of machine-specific single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) instructions, and how a special-purpose compiler can derive optimized implementations of the discrete cosine and sine transforms automatically from a DFT algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (4,194)", "departments": ["IBM", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Princeton University", "Intel", "Princeton University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Stanford University", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Pierre Marquis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marquis:Pierre"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
