Each valid solution $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ gives rise to an objective vector in $\\R^{d+1}$, and one often wants to enumerate the Pareto optima among them. In the worst case there may be exponentially many Pareto optima; however, it was recently shown that in (a generalization of) the smoothed analysis framework, the expected number is polynomial in $n$. Unfortunately, the bound obtained had a rather bad dependence on $d$, roughly $n^{d!}$. We show a significantly improved bound of $n^{2d}$. Our proof is based on defining an algorithm, which we call the $\\mathtt{Witness}$ mapping. This algorithm runs on the data and produces an event, in the form of a testimony, that serves as a concise description of what caused a Pareto optimum. We prove that given any testimony, we can check the values of a strict subset of the random variables in the input and deduce some information about the remaining random variables.
