{"title": "Adaptive pose priors for pictorial structures.", "fields": ["prior probability", "kernel density estimation", "kernel regression", "pairwise comparison", "pose"], "abstract": "Pictorial structure (PS) models are extensively used for part-based recognition of scenes, people, animals and multi-part objects. To achieve tractability, the structure and parameterization of the model is often restricted, for example, by assuming tree dependency structure and unimodal, data-independent pairwise interactions. These expressivity restrictions fail to capture important patterns in the data. On the other hand, local methods such as nearest-neighbor classification and kernel density estimation provide non-parametric flexibility but require large amounts of data to generalize well. We propose a simple semi-parametric approach that combines the tractability of pictorial structure inference with the flexibility of non-parametric methods by expressing a subset of model parameters as kernel regression estimates from a learned sparse set of exemplars. This yields query-specific, image-dependent pose priors. We develop an effective shape-based kernel for upper-body pose similarity and propose a leave-one-out loss function for learning a sparse subset of exemplars for kernel regression. We apply our techniques to two challenging datasets of human figure parsing and advance the state-of-the-art (from 80% to 86% on the Buffy dataset [8]), while using only 15% of the training data as exemplars.", "citation": "Citations (143)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Benjamin Sapp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sapp:Benjamin", "Chris Jordan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jordan:Chris", "Ben Taskar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taskar:Ben"], "pages": 8}
