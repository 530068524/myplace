Attention to particular objects or regions is an important attribute of human vision and perception system in measuring perceived image and video qualities. This paper presents an approach for extracting visual attention regions based on a combination of a bottom-up saliency model and semantic image analysis. The use of PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural SIMilarity) in extracted attention regions is analyzed for image/video quality assessment, and a novel quality metric is proposed which can exploit the attributes of visual attention information adequately. The experimental results with respect to the subjective measurement demonstrate that the proposed metric outperforms the current methods.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "departments": ["Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology", "Nokia", "Tampere University of Technology"], "authors": ["Junyong You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Junyong", "Andrew Perkis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perkis:Andrew", "Miska M.
