We focus on general joint distributions, seeking the optimal deterministic incentive compatible auction. We give a geometric characterization of the optimal auction through a duality theorem, resulting in an efficient algorithm for finding the optimal deterministic auction in the two-bidder case and an inapproximability result for three or more bidders.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Christos H.
