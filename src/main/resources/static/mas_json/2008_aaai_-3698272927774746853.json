State-of-the-art exact solution of unconstrained POMDPs relies on implicit enumeration of the vectors in the piecewise linear value function, and pruning operations to obtain a minimal representation of the updated value function. In dynamic programming for CPOMDPs, each vector takes two valuations, one with respect to the objective function and another with respect to the constraint function. The dynamic programming update consists of finding, for each belief state, the vector that has the best objective function valuation while still satisfying the constraint function. Whereas the pruning operation in an unconstrained POMDP requires solution of a linear program, the pruning operation for CPOMDPs requires solution of a mixed integer linear program.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Sikorsky Aircraft", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Joshua D.
