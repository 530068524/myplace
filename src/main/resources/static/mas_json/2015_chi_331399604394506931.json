{"title": "Barriers to the Localness of Volunteered Geographic Information.", "fields": ["socioeconomic status", "volunteered geographic information", "point of interest", "computer science", "data mining"], "abstract": "Localness is an oft-cited benefit of volunteered geographic information (VGI). This study examines whether localness is a constant, universally shared benefit of VGI, or one that varies depending on the context in which it is produced. Focusing on articles about geographic entities (e.g. cities, points of interest) in 79 language editions of Wikipedia, we examine the localness of both the editors working on articles and the sources of the information they cite. We find extensive geographic inequalities in localness, with the degree of localness varying with the socioeconomic status of the local population and the health of the local media. We also point out the key role of language, showing that information in languages not native to a place tends to be produced and sourced by non-locals. We discuss the implications of this work for our understanding of the nature of VGI and highlight a generalizable technical contribution: an algorithm that determines the home country of the original publisher of online content.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Macalester College", "University of Oxford", "Carleton College", "University of Oxford", "Wikimedia Found ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Shilad Sen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sen:Shilad", "Heather Ford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ford:Heather", "David R.
