The estimators are obtained by adaptively partitioning the sample space. Under a suitable prior, we analyze the concentration rate of the posterior distribution, and demonstrate that the rate does not directly depend on the dimension of the problem in several special cases. Another advantage of this class of Bayesian density estimators is that it can adapt to the unknown smoothness of the true density function, thus achieving the optimal convergence rate without artificial conditions on the density. We also validate the theoretical results on a variety of simulated data sets.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Linxi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Linxi", "Dangna Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dangna", "Wing Hung Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Wing_Hung"], "pages": 9}
