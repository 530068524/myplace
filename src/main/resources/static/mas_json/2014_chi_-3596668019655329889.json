Despite the existence of theoretical frameworks that can be used to analyze such exertion experiences, there are few tools to support the hands-on practice of exertion game design. To address this, we present a set of design cards based on the \"Exertion Framework\", grounded in our experience of creating exertion games for over a decade. We present results demonstrating the value and utility of these Exertion Cards based on our studies of their use in three workshops held over seven sessions with 134 design students and experts. We also articulate lessons learned from transforming a theoretical framework into a design tool that aims to support designers in their practice.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["RMIT University", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Florian Mueller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mueller_0001:Florian", "Martin R.
