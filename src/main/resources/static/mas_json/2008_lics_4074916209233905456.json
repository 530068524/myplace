{"title": "Weak Topology and a Differentiable Operator for Lipschitz Maps.", "fields": ["extension topology", "weak operator topology", "weak topology", "compact open topology", "quasi open map"], "abstract": "We show that the Scott topology induces a topology for real-valued Lipschitz maps on Banach spaces which we call the L-topology. It is the weakest topology with respect to which the L-derivative operator, as a second order functional which maps the space of Lipschitz functions into the function space of non-empty weak* compact and convex valued maps equipped with the Scott topology, is continuous. For finite dimensional Euclidean spaces, where the L-derivative and the Clarke gradient coincide, we provide a simple characterisation of the basic open subsets of the L-topology in terms of ties or primitive maps of functions. We use this to verify that the L-topology is strictly coarser than the well-known Lipschitz norm topology. We then develop a fundamental theorem of calculus of second order in finite dimensions showing that the continuous integral operator from the continuous Scott domain of non-empty convex and compact valued functions to the continuous Scott domain of ties is inverse to the continuous operator induced by the L-derivative.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Abbas Edalat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edalat:Abbas"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
