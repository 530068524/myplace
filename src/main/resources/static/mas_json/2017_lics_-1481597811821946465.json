These models arise by adding natural forms of recursion, branching, or a counter, to finite-state models, and they correspond to probabilistic/control/game extensions of classic automata-theoretic models like pushdown automata, context-free grammars, and one-counter automata. They subsume some classic stochastic processes such as multi-type branching processes and quasi-birth-death processes. They also provide a natural model for probabilistic procedural programs with recursion.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Kousha Etessami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Etessami:Kousha"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 1}
