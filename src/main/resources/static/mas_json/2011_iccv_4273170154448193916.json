In contrast to many existing methods, we directly integrate 3D reasoning with an appearance-based voting architecture. Our method relies on a nonparametric representation of a joint distribution of shape and appearance of the object class. Our voting method employs a novel parametrization of joint detection and viewpoint hypothesis space, allowing efficient accumulation of evidence. We combine this with a re-scoring and refinement mechanism, using an ensemble of view-specific Support Vector Machines. We evaluate the performance of our approach in detection and pose estimation of cars on a number of benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Daniel Glasner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glasner:Daniel", "Meirav Galun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galun:Meirav", "Sharon Alpert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alpert:Sharon", "Ronen Basri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basri:Ronen", "Gregory Shakhnarovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shakhnarovich:Gregory"], "pages": 8}
