In this paper, we propose and analyze an accelerated variant of these methods in the mini-batch setting. This method incorporates two acceleration techniques: one is Nesterov's acceleration method, and the other is a variance reduction for the stochastic gradient. Accelerated proximal gradient descent (APG) and proximal stochastic variance reduction gradient (Prox-SVRG) are in a trade-off relationship. We show that our method, with the appropriate mini-batch size, achieves lower overall complexity than both APG and Prox-SVRG.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["NTT DATA"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Atsushi Nitanda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nitanda:Atsushi"], "pages": 9}
