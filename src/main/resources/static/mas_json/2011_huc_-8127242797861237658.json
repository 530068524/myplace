{"title": "SiFi: exploiting VoIP silence for WiFi energy savings insmart phones.", "fields": ["phone", "android", "streams", "voice over ip", "silence"], "abstract": "Since one-third of a smart phone's battery energy is consumed by its WiFi interface, it is critical to switch the WiFi radio from its active or Constantly Awake Mode (CAM), which draws high power (726mW with screen off), to its sleep or Power Save Mode (PSM), which consumes little power (36mW). Applications like VoIP do not perform well under PSM mode however, due to their real-time nature, so the energy footprint is quite high. The challenge is to save energy while not affecting performance. In this paper we present SiFi: Silence prediction based WiFi energy adaptation. SiFi examines audio streams from phone calls and tracks when silence periods start and stop. This data is stored in a prediction model. Using this historical data, we predict the length of future silence periods and place the WiFi radio to sleep during these periods. We implement the design on an Android Smart phone and acheive 40% energy savings while maintaining high voice fidelity.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln"], "authors": ["Andrew J.
