AR is a key user-interface technology for personalized, situated information delivery, navigation, on-demand instruction and games. The widespread availability and rapid evolution of smartphones enables software-only solutions for AR where it was previously necessary to assemble custom hardware solutions. However, ergonomic and technical limitations of smartphones as a platform make this a challenging endeavor. In particular, it is necessary to design novel efficient real-time computer vision and computer graphics algorithms, and create new lightweight forms of interaction with the environment through small form-factor devices. This tutorial will present selected technical achievements in this field and highlight some examples of successful application prototypes.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Dieter Schmalstieg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmalstieg:Dieter", "Tobias H\u00f6llerer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=llerer:Tobias"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 3}
