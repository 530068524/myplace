Our approach couples a standard structured-light setup and photometric stereo using a large-format ultra-high-resolution camera. While previous approaches have employed similar hybrid imaging systems to fuse positional data with surface normals, what is unique to our approach is the significant asymmetry in the resolution between the low-resolution geometry and the ultra-high-resolution surface normals. To deal with these resolution differences, we propose a multi-resolution surface reconstruction scheme that propagates the low-resolution geometric constraints through the different frequency bands while gradually fusing in the high-resolution photometric stereo data. In addition, to deal with the ultra-high-resolution images, our surface reconstruction is performed in a patch-wise fashion and additional boundary constraints are used to ensure patch coherence. Based on this multi-resolution reconstruction scheme, our imaging framework can produce 3D scans that show exceptionally detailed 3D surfaces far exceeding existing technologies.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Microsoft", "National University of Singapore", "Korean Advanced ...  and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zheng Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0002:Zheng", "Yu-Wing Tai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tai:Yu=Wing", "Moshe Ben-Ezra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Ezra:Moshe", "Michael S.
