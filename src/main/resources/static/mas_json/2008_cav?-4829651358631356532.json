The numerical abstract domain is parameterized by a linear abstract domain and is constructed by means of two domain lifting operations. One domain lifting operation is based on the principle of  expression abstraction (which involves defining a set of expressions and specifying their semantics using a collection of directed inference rules) and has a more general applicability. It lifts any given abstract domain to include reasoning about a given set of expressions whose semantics is abstracted using a set of axioms. The other domain lifting operation incorporates disjunctive reasoning into a given linear relational abstract domain via introduction of  max expressions. We present experimental results demonstrating the potential of the new numerical abstract domain to discover a wide variety of timing bounds (including polynomial, disjunctive, logarithmic, exponential, etc.) for small C programs.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Bhargav S.
