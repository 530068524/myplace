In collaboration with a 6th grade physics instructor and his students, we have developed software tools and curriculum that enable science teachers and students to repurpose gaming technologies to study concepts such as velocity and acceleration. The project involved a year's observation of students' project based learning in a 6th grade physics class, followed by a year of design experimentation to engage students in integrating game controllers into their projects. Using the insights from their observations and suggestions, we created three different Wii Remote-based setups that used the IR camera and the accelerometer to help students glean data from their projects. In this paper, we provide an overview of the project, and then offer data that demonstrates the added value across the material, social, experiential, and temporal aspects of inquiry science activity. We conclude by identifying key design opportunities within this space.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Wendy Ju.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ju:Wendy", "Ugochi Acholonu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acholonu:Ugochi", "Sarah Lewis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lewis:Sarah"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
