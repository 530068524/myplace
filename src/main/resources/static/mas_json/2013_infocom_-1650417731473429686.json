FIB Aggregation, a technique that merges multiple FIB entries into one, is probably the most practical solution since it is a software solution local to a router, and does not require any changes to routing protocols or network operations. While previous work on FIB aggregation mostly focuses on reducing table size, this work focuses on algorithms that can update compressed FIBs quickly and incrementally. Quick update is critical to routers because they have very limited time to process routing updates without impacting packet delivery performance. We have designed three algorithms: FIFA-S for smallest table size, FIFA-T for shortest running time, and FIFA-H for both small tables and short running time, and operators can use the one best suited to their needs. These algorithms significantly improve over existing work in terms of reducing routers' computation overhead and limiting impact on the forwarding plane while maintaining a good compression ratio.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Memphis", "University of Arizona", "University of Memphis"], "authors": ["Yaoqing Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yaoqing", "Beichuan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Beichuan", "Lan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
