The goal of my PhD thesis is to design, develop and evaluate an advanced RTP/RTCP-based IDMS solution fitting the requirements of the emerging distributed media consumption paradigm. In particular, standard compliant extensions to RTCP are being specified to allow for an accurate, adaptive and dynamic IDMS control when using RTP for streaming media. Moreover, the feasibility and suitability of several architectural schemes for exchanging the IDMS information, algorithms for allowing a dynamic IDMS monitoring and control, as well as adjustment techniques are being investigated. Objective and subjective testing are being conducted to validate the satisfactory performance of our IDMS solution and to provide insights about the users' tolerance on asynchrony levels in different IDMS scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Universitat Pol ...
