This provides a simple alternative to existing approaches to  deep  learning whilst yielding competitive error rates compared to those methods, and existing  shallow  semi-supervised techniques.", "citation": "Citations (403)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of Lausanne", "Princeton University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jason Weston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weston:Jason", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ratle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ratle:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Ronan Collobert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collobert:Ronan"], "pages": 8}
