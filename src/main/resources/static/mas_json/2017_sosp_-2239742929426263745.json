{"title": "MittOS: Supporting Millisecond Tail Tolerance with Fast Rejecting SLO-Aware OS Interface.", "fields": ["millisecond", "failover", "cache", "extensibility", "low latency"], "abstract": "MittOS provides operating system support to cut millisecond-level tail latencies for data-parallel applications. In MittOS, we advocate a new principle that operating system should quickly reject IOs that cannot be promptly served. To achieve this, MittOS exposes a fast rejecting SLO-aware interface wherein applications can provide their SLOs (e.g., IO deadlines). If MittOS predicts that the IO SLOs cannot be met, MittOS will promptly return EBUSY signal, allowing the application to failover (retry) to another less-busy node without waiting. We build MittOS within the storage stack (disk, SSD, and OS cache managements), but the principle is extensible to CPU and runtime memory managements as well. MittOS' no-wait approach helps reduce IO completion time up to 35% compared to wait-then-speculate approaches.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "authors": ["Mingzhe Hao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hao:Mingzhe", "Huaicheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Huaicheng", "Michael Hao Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Michael_Hao", "Chrisma Pakha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pakha:Chrisma", "Riza O.
