We propose a variational hierarchical EM algorithm that i) clusters a given collection of HMMs into groups of HMMs that are similar, in terms of the distributions they represent, and ii) characterizes each group by a \"cluster center\", i.e., a novel HMM that is representative for the group. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm on hierarchical clustering of motion capture sequences as well as on automatic music tagging.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "CS Dept., City U of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Emanuele Coviello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coviello:Emanuele", "Antoni B.
