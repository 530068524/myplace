{"title": "Lift-and-round to improve weighted completion time on unrelated machines.", "fields": ["scheduling", "approximation algorithm", "lift", "semidefinite programming", "convex optimization"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of scheduling jobs on unrelated machines so as to minimize the sum of weighted completion times. Our main result is a (3/2-c)-approximation algorithm for some fixed c>0, improving upon the long-standing bound of 3/2. To do this, we first introduce a new lift-and-project based SDP relaxation for the problem. This is necessary as the previous convex programming relaxations have an integrality gap of 3/2. Second, we give a new general bipartite-rounding procedure that produces an assignment with certain strong negative correlation properties.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "University of Maryland, College Park", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Nikhil Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Nikhil", "Aravind Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Aravind", "Ola Svensson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svensson:Ola"], "pages": 12}
