The demonstration will enable users to perform a step-wise deep exploration of such resource contentions faced by a query at various stages of its execution. The interface will allow users to identify top-k victims and sources of contentions, diagnose high-contention nodes and resources in the cluster, and rank their impacts on the performance of a query. Users will also be able to navigate through a set of rules recommended by iQCAR to compare how application of each rule by the cluster scheduler resolves the contentions in subsequent executions.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Prajakta Kalmegh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalmegh:Prajakta", "Harrison Lundberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lundberg:Harrison", "Frederick Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Frederick", "Shivnath Babu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babu:Shivnath", "Sudeepa Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Sudeepa"], "pages": 4}
