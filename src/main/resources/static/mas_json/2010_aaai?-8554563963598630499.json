In single-instance learning problems, dimensionality reduction is an essential step for high-dimensional data analysis and has been studied for years. The curse of dimensionality also exists in multi-instance learning tasks, yet this difficult task has not been studied before. Direct application of existing single-instance dimensionality reduction objectives to multi-instance learning tasks may not work well since it ignores the characteristic of multi-instance learning that the labels of bags are known while the labels of instances are unknown. In this paper, we propose an effective model and develop an efficient algorithm to solve the multi-instance dimensionality reduction problem. We formulate the objective as an optimization problem by considering orthonormality and sparsity constraints in the projection matrix for dimensionality reduction, and then solve it by the gradient descent along the tangent space of the orthonormal matrices. We also propose an approximation for improving the efficiency. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Yu-Yin Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yu=Yin", "Michael K.
