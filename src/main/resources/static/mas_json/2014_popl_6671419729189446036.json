Such games have numerous applications in program verification and synthesis, including the synthesis of infinite-state reactive programs and branching-time verification of infinite-state programs. Our method handles games with winning conditions given by safety, reachability, and general Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) properties. For each property class, we give a deductive proof rule that --- provided a symbolic representation of the game players --- describes a winning strategy for a particular player. Our rules are sound and relatively complete. We show that these rules can be automated by using an off-the-shelf Horn constraint solver that supports existential quantification in clause heads. The practical promise of the rules is demonstrated through several case studies, including a challenging \"Cinderella-Stepmother game\" that allows infinite alternation of discrete and continuous choices by two players, as well as examples derived from prior work on program repair and synthesis.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Microsoft", "Technische Univ ...
