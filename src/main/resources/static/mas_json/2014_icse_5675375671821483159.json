{"title": "An exploratory study of the pull-based software development model.", "fields": ["software development", "community engagement", "empirical process", "bittorrent tracker", "small number"], "abstract": "The advent of distributed version control systems has led to the development of a new paradigm for distributed software development; instead of pushing changes to a central repository, developers pull them from other repositories and merge them locally. Various code hosting sites, notably Github, have tapped on the opportunity to facilitate pull-based development by offering workflow support tools, such as code reviewing systems and integrated issue trackers. In this work, we explore how pull-based software development works, first on the GHTorrent corpus and then on a carefully selected sample of 291 projects. We find that the pull request model offers fast turnaround, increased opportunities for community engagement and decreased time to incorporate contributions. We show that a relatively small number of factors affect both the decision to merge a pull request and the time to process it. We also examine the reasons for pull request rejection and find that technical ones are only a small minority.", "citation": "Citations (230)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Georgios Gousios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gousios:Georgios", "Martin Pinzger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinzger_0001:Martin", "Arie van Deursen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deursen:Arie_van"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
