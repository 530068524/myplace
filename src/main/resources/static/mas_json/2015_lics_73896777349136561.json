{"title": "Abstract Hidden Markov Models: A Monadic Account of Quantitative Information Flow.", "fields": ["variable order markov model", "hidden semi markov model", "probabilistic logic", "monad", "markov model"], "abstract": "Hidden Markov Models, HMM's, are mathematical models of Markov processes whose state is hidden but from which information can leak via channels. They are typically represented as 3-way joint probability distributions. We use HMM's as denotations of probabilistic hidden-state sequential programs, after recasting them as \"abstract\" HMM's, i.e. Computations in the Giry monad D, and equipping them with a partial order of increasing security. However to encode the monadic type with hiding over state X we use Da#x03C7;a#x2192;D2a#x03C7; rather than the conventional a#x03C7;a#x2192;Da#x03C7;. We illustrate this construction with a very small Haskell prototype. We then present uncertainty measures as a generalisation of the extant diversity of probabilistic entropies, and we propose characteristic analytic properties for them. Based on that, we give a \"backwards\", uncertainty-transformer semantics for HMM's, dual to the \"forwards\" abstract HMM's. Finally, we discuss the Dalenius desideratum for statistical databases as an issue in semantic compositionality, and propose a means for taking it into account.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Macquarie University", "Macquarie University", "Sch. of Comp.
