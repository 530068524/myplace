{"title": "A Solver for Reachability Modulo Theories.", "fields": ["reachability problem", "restrict", "global variable", "predicate abstraction", "solver"], "abstract": "Consider a sequential programming language with control flow constructs such as assignments, choice, loops, and procedure calls. We restrict the syntax of expressions in this language to one that can be efficiently decided by a satisfiability-modulo-theories solver. For such a language, we define the problem of deciding whether a program can reach a particular control location as the reachability-modulo-theories problem. This paper describes the architecture of Corral, a semi-algorithm for the reachability-modulo-theories problem. Corraluses novel algorithms for inlining procedures on demand (Stratified Inlining) and abstraction refinement (Hierarchical Refinement). The paper also presents an evaluation of Corralagainst other related tools. Corralconsistently outperforms its competitors on most benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Akash Lal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lal:Akash", "Shaz Qadeer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qadeer:Shaz", "Shuvendu K.
