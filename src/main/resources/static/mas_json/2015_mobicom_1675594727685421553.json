{"title": "Extending Mobile Interaction Through Near-Field Visible Light Sensing.", "fields": ["mobile interaction", "virtual keyboard", "touchpad", "workspace", "visible light communication"], "abstract": "Mobile devices are shrinking their form factors for portability, but user-mobile interaction is becoming increasingly challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel system called Okuli to meet this challenge. Okuli is a compact, low-cost system that can augment a mobile device and extend its interaction workspace to any nearby surface area. Okuli piggybacks on visible light communication modules, and uses a low-power LED and two light sensors to locate user's finger within the workspace. It is built on a light propagation/reflection model that achieves around one-centimeter location precision, with zero run-time training overhead. We have prototyped Okuli as an Android peripheral, with a 3D-printed shroud to host the LED and light sensors. Our experiments demonstrate Okuli's accuracy, stability, energy efficiency, as well as its potential in serving virtual keyboard and trackpad applications.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Chi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chi", "Josh Tabor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tabor:Josh", "Jialiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jialiang", "Xinyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xinyu"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2015", "pages": 13}
