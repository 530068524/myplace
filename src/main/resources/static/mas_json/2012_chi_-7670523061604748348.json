Gaze-based graphical passwords are a particularly promising means for shoulder-surfing-resistant authentication, but selecting secure passwords remains challenging. In this paper, we present a novel gaze-based authentication scheme that makes use of cued-recall graphical passwords on a single image. In order to increase password security, our approach uses a computational model of visual attention to mask those areas of the image that are most likely to attract visual attention. We create a realistic threat model for attacks that may occur in public settings, such as filming the user's interaction while drawing money from an ATM. Based on a 12-participant user study, we show that our approach is significantly more secure than a standard image-based authentication and gaze-based 4-digit PIN entry.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Stuttgart", "University of Stuttgart"], "authors": ["Andreas Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Andreas", "Florian Alt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alt:Florian", "Albrecht Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt_0001:Albrecht"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
