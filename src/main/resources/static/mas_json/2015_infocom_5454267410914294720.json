In light of this, we propose to enable a secure and efficient cloud-assisted image sharing architecture for mobile devices, by leveraging outsourced encrypted image datasets with privacy assurance. Different from traditional image sharing, the proposed design aims to save the transmission cost from mobile clients, by directly utilizing outsourced correlated images to reproduce the image of interest inside the cloud for immediate dissemination. While the benefits are obvious, how to leverage the encrypted image datasets makes the problem particular challenging. To tackle the problem, we first propose a secure and efficient index design that allows the mobile client to securely find from the encrypted image datasets the candidate selection pertaining to the image of interest for sharing. We then design two specialized encryption mechanisms that support the secure image reproduction inside the cloud directly from the encrypted candidate selection. We formally analyze the security strength of the design. Our experiments show that up to 90% of the transmission cost at the mobile client can be saved, while achieving all service requirements and security guarantees.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Helei Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Helei", "Xingliang Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Xingliang", "Cong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Cong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
