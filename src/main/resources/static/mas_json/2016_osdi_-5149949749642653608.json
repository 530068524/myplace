{"title": "Network Requirements for Resource Disaggregation.", "fields": ["latency", "real time computing", "server", "architecture", "low latency"], "abstract": "Traditional datacenters are designed as a collection of servers, each of which tightly couples the resources required for computing tasks. Recent industry trends suggest a paradigm shift to a disaggregated datacenter (DDC) architecture containing a pool of resources, each built as a standalone resource blade and interconnected using a network fabric.\n\nA key enabling (or blocking) factor for disaggregation will be the network - to support good application-level performance it becomes critical that the network fabric provide low latency communication even under the increased traffic load that disaggregation introduces. In this paper, we use a workload-driven approach to derive the minimum latency and bandwidth requirements that the network in disaggregated datacenters must provide to avoid degrading application-level performance and explore the feasibility of meeting these requirements with existing system designs and commodity networking technology.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Peter Xiang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Peter_Xiang", "Akshay Narayan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayan:Akshay", "Sagar Karandikar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karandikar:Sagar", "Joao Carreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carreira:Joao", "Sangjin Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Sangjin", "Rachit Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal_0001:Rachit", "Sylvia Ratnasamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ratnasamy:Sylvia", "Scott Shenker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shenker:Scott"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2016", "pages": 16}
