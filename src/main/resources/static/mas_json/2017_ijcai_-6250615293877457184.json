{"title": "On the Kernelization of Global Constraints.", "fields": ["local consistency", "constraint programming", "kernelization", "parameterized complexity", "preprocessor"], "abstract": "Kernelization is a powerful concept from parameterized complexity theory that captures (a certain idea of) efficient polynomial-time preprocessing for hard decision problems. However, exploiting this technique in the context of constraint programming is challenging. Building on recent results for the VERTEXCOVER constraint, we introduce novel \"loss-less\" kernelization variants that are tailored for constraint propagation. We showcase the theoretical interest of our ideas on two constraints, VERTEXCOVER and EDGEDOMINATINGSET.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Grenoble", "University College Cork"], "authors": ["Cl\u00e9ment Carbonnel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carbonnel:Cl=eacute=ment", "Emmanuel Hebrard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hebrard:Emmanuel"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
