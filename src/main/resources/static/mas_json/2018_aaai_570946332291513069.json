One important application is clinical endpoint prediction, which aims to predict whether a disease, a symptom or an abnormal lab test will happen in the future according to patients' history records. This paper develops deep learning techniques for clinical endpoint prediction, which are effective in many practical applications. However, the problem is very challenging since patients' history records contain multiple heterogeneous temporal events such as lab tests, diagnosis, and drug administrations. The visiting patterns of different types of events vary significantly, and there exist complex nonlinear relationships between different events. In this paper, we propose a novel model for learning the joint representation of heterogeneous temporal events. The model adds a new gate to control the visiting rates of different events which effectively models the irregular patterns of different events and their nonlinear correlations. Experiment results with real-world clinical data on the tasks of predicting death and abnormal lab tests prove the effectiveness of our proposed approach over competitive baselines.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Luchen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Luchen", "Jianhao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Jianhao", "Ming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Ming", "Zichang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zichang", "Jian Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jian"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
