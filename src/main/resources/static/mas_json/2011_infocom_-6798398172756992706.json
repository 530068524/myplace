In this paper, we tackle this problem from an algorithmic perspective: formulating the problem of tiered data pricing plans for a wireless provider, and proposing an efficient algorithmic framework to compute the plans. Our algorithmic framework can be applied to the usage and cost data of any provider to obtain the pricing functions specific to that provider", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Princeton University", "AT&T"], "authors": ["MohammadHossein Bateni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bateni:MohammadHossein", "Mohammad Taghi Hajiaghayi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hajiaghayi:Mohammad_Taghi", "Sina Jafarpour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jafarpour:Sina", "Dan Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Dan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
