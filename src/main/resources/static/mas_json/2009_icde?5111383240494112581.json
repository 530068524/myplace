We propose various secure building blocks for the computations of QR algorithm so that it is privacy-preserving. Some of the proposed secure building blocks include Secure Matrix Multiplication, $(x+y)^{-1}$, and $\\sqrt{x+y}$. Together, they allow us to derive Privacy-Preserving SVD (PPSVD) based on a privacy-preserving QR algorithm. Finally we conduct experiments to evaluate the proposed secure building blocks and protocols. The results show that the proposed protocols for SVD achieve high accuracy for matrices of small and medium size.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Shuguo Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Shuguo", "Wee Keong Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Wee_Keong", "Philip S.
