{"title": "How Hard Is It for a Party to Nominate an Election Winner?.", "fields": ["nominate", "voting", "blanket primary", "computational complexity theory", "computational social choice"], "abstract": "We consider a Plurality-voting scenario, where the candidates are split between parties, and each party nominates exactly one candidate for the final election. We study the computational complexity of deciding if there is a set of nominees such that a candidate from a given party wins in the final election. In our second problem, the goal is to decide if a candidate from a given party always wins, irrespective who is nominated. We show that these problems are computationally hard, but are polynomial-time solvable for restricted settings.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["AGH University of Science and Technology", "Paris Dauphine University", "Paris Dauphine University", "Paris Dauphine University", "Paris Dauphine University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Piotr Faliszewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faliszewski:Piotr", "Laurent Gourv\u00e8s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gourv=egrave=s:Laurent", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Julien Lesca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lesca:Julien", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Monnot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monnot:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me"], "pages": 7}
