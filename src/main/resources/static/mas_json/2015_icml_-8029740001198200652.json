{"title": "Deterministic Independent Component Analysis.", "fields": ["independent component analysis", "statistics", "pattern recognition", "matrix", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We study independent component analysis with noisy observations. We present, for the first time in the literature, consistent, polynomial-time algorithms to recover non-Gaussian source signals and the mixing matrix with a reconstruction error that vanishes at a 1/\u221aT rate using T observations and scales only polynomially with the natural parameters of the problem. Our algorithms and analysis also extend to deterministic source signals whose empirical distributions are approximately independent.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ruitong Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Ruitong", "Andr\u00e1s Gy\u00f6rgy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gy=ouml=rgy:Andr=aacute=s", "Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szepesv=aacute=ri:Csaba"], "pages": 10}
