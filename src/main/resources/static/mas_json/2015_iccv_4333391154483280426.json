{"title": "Where to Buy It: Matching Street Clothing Photos in Online Shops.", "fields": ["deep learning", "computer vision", "multimedia", "clothing", "similarity measure"], "abstract": "In this paper, we define a new task, Exact Street to Shop, where our goal is to match a real-world example of a garment item to the same item in an online shop. This is an extremely challenging task due to visual differences between street photos (pictures of people wearing clothing in everyday uncontrolled settings) and online shop photos (pictures of clothing items on people, mannequins, or in isolation, captured by professionals in more controlled settings). We collect a new dataset for this application containing 404,683 shop photos collected from 25 different online retailers and 20,357 street photos, providing a total of 39,479 clothing item matches between street and shop photos. We develop three different methods for Exact Street to Shop retrieval, including two deep learning baseline methods, and a method to learn a similarity measure between the street and shop domains. Experiments demonstrate that our learned similarity significantly outperforms our baselines that use existing deep learning based representations.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["M.
