The use of this nonlinear transformation, which is included as part of the probabilistic model, was shown to enhance performance by providing a better prior model on several data sets. In order to learn its parameters, maximum likelihood was used. In this work we show that it is possible to use a non-parametric nonlinear transformation in WGP and variationally integrate it out. The resulting Bayesian WGP is then able to work in scenarios in which the maximum likelihood WGP failed: Low data regime, data with censored values, classification, etc. We demonstrate the superior performance of Bayesian warped GPs on several real data sets.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Charles III University of Madrid"], "authors": ["Miguel L\u00e1zaro-Gredilla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=aacute=zaro=Gredilla:Miguel"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
