It makes the following contributions: (i) It shows how one can formulate DCOPs as logic programs; (ii) It introduces ASP-DPOP, the first DCOP algorithm that is based on logic programming; (iii) It experimentally shows that ASP-DPOP can be up to two orders of magnitude faster than DPOP (its imperative-programming counterpart) as well as solve some problems that DPOP fails to solve due to memory limitations; and (iv) It demonstrates the applicability of ASP in the wide array of multi-agent problems currently modeled as DCOPs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["New Mexico State University", "New Mexico State University", "New Mexico State University", "New Mexico State University"], "authors": ["Tiep Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Tiep", "Tran Cao Son.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Son:Tran_Cao", "Enrico Pontelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pontelli:Enrico", "William Yeoh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeoh_0001:William"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
