{"title": "Predicting Session Length in Media Streaming.", "fields": ["scheduling", "survival analysis", "real time computing", "dwell time", "data mining"], "abstract": "Session length is a very important aspect in determining a user's satisfaction with a media streaming service. Being able to predict how long a session will last can be of great use for various downstream tasks, such as recommendations and ad scheduling. Most of the related literature on user interaction duration has focused on dwell time for websites, usually in the context of approximating post-click satisfaction either in search results, or display ads.   In this work we present the first analysis of session length in a mobile-focused online service, using a real world data-set from a major music streaming service. We use survival analysis techniques to show that the characteristics of the length distributions can differ significantly between users, and use gradient boosted trees with appropriate objectives to predict the length of a session using only information available at its beginning. Our evaluation on real world data illustrates that our proposed technique outperforms the considered baseline.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["RISE SICS, Stockholm, Sweden", "Pandora Media I ... akland, CA, USA", "Pandora Media I ... akland, CA, USA", "Pandora Media I ... akland, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Theodore Vasiloudis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasiloudis:Theodore", "Hossein Vahabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vahabi:Hossein", "Ross Kravitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kravitz:Ross", "Valery Rashkov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rashkov:Valery"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
