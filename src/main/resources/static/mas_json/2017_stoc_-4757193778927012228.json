{"title": "A quantum linearity test for robustly verifying entanglement.", "fields": ["tensor product", "qubit", "pauli exclusion principle", "interactive proof system", "observable"], "abstract": "We introduce a simple two-player test which certifies that the players apply tensor products of Pauli \ufffd   X   and \ufffd   Z   observables on the tensor product of  n  EPR pairs. The test has constant robustness: any strategy achieving success probability within an additive of the optimal must be  poly (I\u00b5)-close, in the appropriate distance measure, to the honest  n -qubit strategy. The test involves 2 n -bit questions and 2-bit answers. The key technical ingredient is a quantum version of the classical linearity test of Blum, Luby, and Rubinfeld.   As applications of our result we give (i) the first robust self-test for  n  EPR pairs; (ii) a quantum multiprover interactive proof system for the local Hamiltonian problem with a constant number of provers and classical questions and answers, and a constant completeness-soundness gap independent of system size; (iii) a robust protocol for verifiable delegated quantum computation with a constant number of quantum polynomial-time provers sharing entanglement.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anand Natarajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Natarajan:Anand", "Thomas Vidick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidick:Thomas"], "pages": 13}
