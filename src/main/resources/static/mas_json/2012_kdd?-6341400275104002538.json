The goal of this paper is to efficiently compute single node relevance and top-k/highly relevant nodes without iteratively computing the relevances of all nodes. Based on a \"random surfer model\", PPR iteratively computes the relevances of all nodes in a graph until convergence for a given user preference distribution. The problem with this iterative approach is that it cannot compute the relevance of just one or a few nodes. The heart of our solution is to compute single node relevance accurately in non-iterative manner based on sparse matrix representation, and to compute top-k/highly relevant nodes exactly by pruning unnecessary relevance computations based on upper/lower relevance estimations. Our experiments show that our approach is up to seven orders of magnitude faster than the existing alternatives.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone"], "authors": ["Yasuhiro Fujiwara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujiwara:Yasuhiro", "Makoto Nakatsuji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakatsuji:Makoto", "Takeshi Yamamuro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamamuro:Takeshi", "Hiroaki Shiokawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shiokawa:Hiroaki", "Makoto Onizuka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Onizuka:Makoto"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
