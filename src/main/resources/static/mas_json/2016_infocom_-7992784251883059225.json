While the set of such techniques is growing, the level of resiliency to failures that this approach can provide is not adequately understood. We embark upon a systematic algorithmic study of the resiliency of immediate failover in a variety of models (with/without packet marking/duplication, etc.). We leverage our findings to devise new schemes for immediate failover and show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these outperform existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Aalto University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of California, Berkeley", "Aalto University"], "authors": ["Marco Chiesa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiesa:Marco", "Ilya Nikolaevskiy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikolaevskiy:Ilya", "Slobodan Mitrovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitrovic:Slobodan", "Aurojit Panda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panda:Aurojit", "Andrei V.
