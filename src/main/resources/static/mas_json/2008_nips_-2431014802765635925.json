{"title": "A Massively Parallel Digital Learning Processor.", "fields": ["clock rate", "memory bank", "mnist database", "memory bandwidth", "simd"], "abstract": "We present a new, massively parallel architecture for accelerating machine learning algorithms, based on arrays of vector processing elements (VPEs) with variable-resolution arithmetic. Groups of VPEs operate in SIMD (single instruction multiple data) mode, and each group is connected to an independent memory bank. The memory bandwidth thus scales with the number of VPEs, while the main data flows are local, keeping power dissipation low. With 256 VPEs, implemented on two FPGAs (field programmable gate array) chips, we obtain a sustained speed of 19 GMACS (billion multiply-accumulate per sec.) for SVM training, and 86 GMACS for SVM classification. This performance is more than an order of magnitude higher than that of any FPGA implementation reported so far. The speed on one FPGA is similar to the fastest speeds published on a Graphics Processor for the MNIST problem, despite a clock rate that is an order of magnitude lower. Tests with Convolutional Neural Networks show similar compute performances. This massively parallel architecture is particularly attractive for embedded applications, where low power dissipation is critical.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Hans Peter Graf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Graf:Hans_Peter", "Srihari Cadambi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cadambi:Srihari", "Igor Durdanovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durdanovic:Igor", "Venkata Jakkula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jakkula:Venkata", "Murugan Sankaradass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankaradass:Murugan", "Eric Cosatto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cosatto:Eric", "Srimat T.
