We show that the Ranking algorithm of [KVV90] achieves a competitive ratio of at least 0.653. This is the first analysis to show an algorithm which breaks the natural 1 - 1/e -barrier' in the unknown distribution model (our analysis in fact works in the stricter, random order model) and answers an open question in [GM08]. We also describe a family of graphs on which Ranking does no better than 0.727 in the random order model. Finally, we show that for graphs which have k > 1 disjoint perfect matchings, Ranking achieves a competitive ratio of at least 1 - \u221a(1/k - 1/k 2  + 1/n) -- in particular Ranking achieves a factor of 1 - o(1) for graphs with \u03c9(1) disjoint perfect matchings.", "citation": "Citations (134)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Chinmay Karande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karande:Chinmay", "Aranyak Mehta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehta:Aranyak", "Pushkar Tripathi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tripathi:Pushkar"], "pages": 10}
