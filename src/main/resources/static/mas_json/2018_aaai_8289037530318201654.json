{"title": "Adversarial Learning for Chinese NER From Crowd Annotations.", "fields": ["data set", "crowdsourcing", "labeled data", "named entity recognition", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "To quickly obtain new labeled data, we can choose crowdsourcing as an alternative way at lower cost in a short time. But as an exchange, crowd annotations from non-experts may be of lower quality than those from experts. In this paper, we propose an approach to performing crowd annotation learning for Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER) to make full use of the noisy sequence labels from multiple annotators. Inspired by adversarial learning, our approach uses a common Bi-LSTM and a private Bi-LSTM for representing annotator-generic and -specific information. The annotator-generic information is the common knowledge for entities easily mastered by the crowd. Finally, we build our Chinese NE tagger based on the LSTM-CRF model. In our experiments, we create two data sets for Chinese NER tasks from two domains. The experimental results show that our system achieves better scores than strong baseline systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Soochow University", "Central South University"], "authors": ["YaoSheng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:YaoSheng", "Meishan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Meishan", "Wenliang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wenliang", "Wei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wei", "Haofen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haofen", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Min"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
