{"title": "A framework for load balancing of tensor contraction expressions via dynamic task partitioning.", "fields": ["dynamic load testing", "tensor", "expression", "tensor contraction", "coupled cluster"], "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Load-balanced Tensor Contractions (DLTC), a domain-specific library for efficient task parallel execution of tensor contraction expressions, a class of computation encountered in quantum chemistry and physics. Our framework decomposes each contraction into smaller unit of tasks, represented by an abstraction referred to as  iterators . We exploit an extra level of parallelism by having tasks across independent contractions executed concurrently through a dynamic load balancing runtime. We demonstrate the improved performance, scalability, and flexibility for the computation of tensor contraction expressions on parallel computers using examples from Coupled Cluster (CC) methods.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Pai-Wei Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Pai=Wei", "Kevin Stock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stock:Kevin", "Samyam Rajbhandari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajbhandari:Samyam", "Sriram Krishnamoorthy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnamoorthy:Sriram", "P.
