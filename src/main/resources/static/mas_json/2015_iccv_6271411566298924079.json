{"title": "Component-Wise Modeling of Articulated Objects.", "fields": ["merge", "computer vision", "deformation", "artificial intelligence", "computer science"], "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework for modeling articulated objects based on the aspects of their components. By decomposing the object into components, we divide the problem in smaller modeling tasks. After obtaining 3D models for each component aspect by employing a shape deformation paradigm, we merge them together, forming the object components. The final model is obtained by assembling the components using an optimization scheme which fits the respective 3D models to the corresponding apparent contours in a reference pose. The results suggest that our approach can produce realistic 3D models of articulated objects in reasonable time.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Valsamis Ntouskos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ntouskos:Valsamis", "Marta Sanzari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanzari:Marta", "Bruno Cafaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cafaro:Bruno", "Federico Nardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nardi:Federico", "Fabrizio Natola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Natola:Fabrizio", "Fiora Pirri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pirri:Fiora", "Manuel A.
