{"title": "DMA++: on the fly data realignment for on-chip memories.", "fields": ["data structure alignment", "instruction set", "simd", "code generation", "multi core processor", "compiler"], "abstract": "Multimedia extensions based on Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) units are widespread. They are used both in processors and accelerators (e.g., the Cell SPEs), since some time ago. SIMD units have usually big memory alignment constraints in order to meet power requirements and design simplicity. This increases the complexity of the code generated by the compiler, as in the general case, the compiler cannot be sure of the proper alignment of data. For that, the ISA provides either unaligned memory load and store instructions, or a special set of instructions to perform the realignments in software. In this paper, we propose a hardware realignment unit that takes advantage of the DMA transfers needed in accelerators with local memories. While the data is being transferred, it is realigned on the fly by our realignment unit, and stored with the proper alignment in the accelerator memory. The accelerator can then access the data with no special instructions. Finally, the data is realigned properly also when put back to main memory. Our experiments with four applications show that with our approach, the bandwidth of the DMA transfers is not penalized. And the performance of the synthetic benchmarks shows that aligned code is 1.5 to 2 times better with respect using unaligned code.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Barcelona Supercomputing Center", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "University of Antioquia", "Barcelona Supercomputing Center", "Barcelona Supercomputing Center", "Barcelona Super ... arcelona, Spain", "Barcelona Super ... arcelona, Spain", "Barcelona Super ... arcelona, Spain", "Barcelona Super ... arcelona, Spain", "Barcelona Super ... arcelona, Spain"], "authors": ["Nikola Vujic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vujic:Nikola", "Marc Gonz\u00e1lez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonz=aacute=lez:Marc", "Felipe Cabarcas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cabarcas:Felipe", "Alex Ram\u00edrez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ram=iacute=rez:Alex", "Xavier Martorell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martorell:Xavier", "Eduard Ayguad\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ayguad=eacute=:Eduard"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
