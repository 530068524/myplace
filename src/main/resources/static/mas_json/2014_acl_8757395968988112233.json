A pair of source and target phrases are projected into continuous-valued vector representations in a low-dimensional latent space, where their translation score is computed by the distance between the pair in this new space. The projection is performed by a neural network whose weights are learned on parallel training data. Experimental evaluation has been performed on two WMT translation tasks. Our best result improves the performance of a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system trained on WMT 2012 French-English data by up to 1.3 BLEU points.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jianfeng Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jianfeng", "Xiaodong He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Xiaodong", "Wen-tau Yih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yih:Wen=tau", "Li Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng_0001:Li"], "pages": 11}
