Observations.", "fields": ["oracle", "empirical risk minimization", "inequality", "independent and identically distributed random variables", "support vector machine"], "abstract": "We prove an oracle inequality for generic regularized empirical risk minimization algorithms learning from \u03b1-mixing processes. To illustrate this oracle inequality, we use it to derive learning rates for some learning methods including least squares SVMs. Since the proof of the oracle inequality uses recent localization ideas developed for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) processes, it turns out that these learning rates are close to the optimal rates known in the i.i.d. case.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Los Alamos National Laboratory", "University of Bayreuth"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ingo Steinwart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinwart:Ingo", "Andreas Christmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Christmann:Andreas"], "pages": 9}
