{"title": "MatrixMiner: a red pill to architect informal product descriptions in the matrix.", "fields": ["product description", "exploit", "traceability", "matrix", "natural language"], "abstract": "Domain analysts, product managers, or customers aim to capture the important features and differences among a set of related products. A case-by-case reviewing of each product description is a laborious and time-consuming task that fails to deliver a condensed view of a product line. This paper introduces MatrixMiner: a tool for automatically synthesizing product comparison matrices (PCMs) from a set of product descriptions written in natural language. MatrixMiner is capable of identifying and organizing features and values in a PCM \u2013 despite the informality and absence of structure in the textual descriptions of products. Our empirical results of products mined from BestBuy show that the synthesized PCMs exhibit numerous quantitative, comparable information. Users can exploit MatrixMiner to visualize the matrix through a Web editor and review, refine, or complement the cell values thanks to the traceability with the original product descriptions and technical specifications.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Rennes", "University of Rennes", "University of Rennes", "University of Rennes", "University of Rennes"], "authors": ["Sana Ben Nasr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nasr:Sana_Ben", "Guillaume B\u00e9can.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=eacute=can:Guillaume", "Mathieu Acher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acher:Mathieu", "Jo\u00e3o Bosco Ferreira Filho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filho:Jo=atilde=o_Bosco_Ferreira", "Benoit Baudry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baudry:Benoit", "Nicolas Sannier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sannier:Nicolas", "Jean-Marc Davril.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davril:Jean=Marc"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
