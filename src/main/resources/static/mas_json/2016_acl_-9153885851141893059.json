{"title": "Neural Word Segmentation Learning for Chinese.", "fields": ["feature engineering", "sequence labeling", "text segmentation", "segmentation", "artificial neural network"], "abstract": "Most previous approaches to Chinese word segmentation formalize this problem as a character-based sequence labeling task where only contextual information within fixed sized local windows and simple interactions between adjacent tags can be captured. In this paper, we propose a novel neural framework which thoroughly eliminates context windows and can utilize complete segmentation history. Our model employs a gated combination neural network over characters to produce distributed representations of word candidates, which are then given to a long short-term memory (LSTM) language scoring model. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that without the help of feature engineering as most existing approaches, our models achieve competitive or better performances with previous state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Deng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Deng", "Hai Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Hai"], "pages": -1}
