We use edge weights which take advantage of local inputs \u03a7 and thus scale to large problems. For a general class of edge weights, we give a negative learnability result. However, we demonstrate that two members of the class\u2013local Conditional Mutual Information and Decomposable Conditional Influence\u2013 have reasonable theoretical bases and perform very well in practice. On synthetic data and a large-scale fMRI application, our methods outperform existing techniques.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Joseph K.
