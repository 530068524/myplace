{"title": "From the PRP to the Low Prior Discovery Recall Principle for Recommender Systems.", "fields": ["recommender system", "ranking", "popularity", "novelty", "recall"], "abstract": "We revisit the Probability Ranking Principle in the context of recommender systems. We find a key difference in the retrieval protocol with respect to query-based search, that leads to the identification of different optimal ranking principles for discovery-oriented recommendation. Based on this finding, we revise the effectiveness of common non-personalized ranking functions in respect to the new principles. We run an experiment confirming and illustrating our theoretical analysis, and providing further observations and hints for reflection and future research.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Madrid", "Autonomous University of Madrid"], "authors": ["Roc\u00edo Ca\u00f1amares.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ca=ntilde=amares:Roc=iacute=o", "Pablo Castells.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castells:Pablo"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
