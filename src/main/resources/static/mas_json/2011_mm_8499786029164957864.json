We eliminate the redundancy not only from spatial and temporal domain, but also from content domain. First, we detect shot boundaries and extract video objects by a 3D graph-based algorithm. Once the objects are obtained, the shape of the objects need to be represented. The key objects are extracted in a global manner by K-means clustering of shapes. Experimental results on the proposed object-based scheme combined with efficient video object segmentation show desirable summarization.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Zhiqiang Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Zhiqiang", "Jianru Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Jianru", "Xuguang Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Xuguang", "Ce Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Ce", "Nanning Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Nanning"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
