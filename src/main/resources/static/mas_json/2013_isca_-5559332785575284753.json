{"title": "Efficient virtual memory for big memory servers.", "fields": ["flat memory model", "memory segmentation", "page table", "translation lookaside buffer", "demand paging"], "abstract": "Our analysis shows that many \"big-memory\" server workloads, such as databases, in-memory caches, and graph analytics, pay a high cost for page-based virtual memory. They consume as much as 10% of execution cycles on TLB misses, even using large pages. On the other hand, we find that these workloads use read-write permission on most pages, are provisioned not to swap, and rarely benefit from the full flexibility of page-based virtual memory.   To remove the TLB miss overhead for big-memory workloads, we propose mapping part of a process's linear virtual address space with a  direct segment , while page mapping the rest of the virtual address space. Direct segments use minimal hardware---base, limit and offset registers per core---to map contiguous virtual memory regions directly to contiguous physical memory. They eliminate the possibility of TLB misses for key data structures such as database buffer pools and in-memory key-value stores. Memory mapped by a direct segment may be converted back to paging when needed.   We prototype direct-segment software support for x86-64 in Linux and emulate direct-segment hardware. For our workloads, direct segments eliminate almost all TLB misses and reduce the execution time wasted on TLB misses to less than 0.5%.", "citation": "Citations (186)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Hewlett-Packard", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Arkaprava Basu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basu:Arkaprava", "Jayneel Gandhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gandhi:Jayneel", "Jichuan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Jichuan", "Mark D.
