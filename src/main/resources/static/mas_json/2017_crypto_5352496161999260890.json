If such an ESP is built with two schemes that are respectively additively and multiplicatively homomorphic, it naturally gives rise to a secure 2-party computation protocol. It is thus perfectly suited for evaluating functions, such as multivariate polynomials, given as arithmetic circuits. Couteau et al. built an ESP to switch between Elgamal and Paillier encryptions which do not naturally fit well together. Consequently, they had to design a clever variant of Elgamal over \\(\\mathbf {Z}/n\\mathbf {Z}\\) with a costly shared decryption.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Bordeaux", "University of Montpellier", "University of Montpellier", "Claude Bernard University Lyon 1"], "authors": ["Guilhem Castagnos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castagnos:Guilhem", "Laurent Imbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Imbert:Laurent", "Fabien Laguillaumie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laguillaumie:Fabien"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 33}
