Modeling accurate grass-grass, grass-object and grass-wind interactions requires a high computational cost. In this paper, we present a method to simulate grass field in real-time by considering grass field as a two dimensional grid-based continuum and shifting the complex interactions to the dynamics of continuum. We adopt the wave simulation as the numerical model for the dynamics of continuum which represents grass-grass interaction. We propose a procedural approach to handle grass-object and grass-wind interactions as external force that updates the wave simulation. The proposed method can be efficiently implemented on a GPU. As a result, massive amounts of grass can interact with moving objects and wind in real-time.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Kan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Kan", "Henry Johan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johan:Henry"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
