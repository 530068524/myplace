Dynamic analysis is effective in producing execution traces that assist comprehension. Traces are rich sources of information regarding the behaviour of a program. However, it is challenging to gain insight from traces due to their overwhelming amount of data and complexity. We propose a generic technique for facilitating comprehension by inferring recurring execution motifs. Inspired by bioinformatics, motifs are patterns in traces that are flexible to small changes in execution, and are captured in a hierarchical model. The hierarchical nature of the model provides an overview of the behaviour at a high-level, while preserving the execution details and intermediate levels in a structured manner. We design a visualization that allows developers to observe and interact with the model. We implement our approach in an open-source tool, called S abalan , and evaluate it through a user experiment. The results show that using S abalan  improves developers' accuracy in performing comprehension tasks by 54%.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Saba Alimadadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alimadadi:Saba", "Ali Mesbah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mesbah_0001:Ali", "Karthik Pattabiraman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pattabiraman:Karthik"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2018", "pages": 12}
