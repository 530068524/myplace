We cast the stochastic multiple objective optimization problem into a constrained optimization problem by choosing one function as the objective and try to bound other objectives by appropriate thresholds. We first examine a two stages exploration-exploitation based algorithm which first approximates the stochastic objectives by sampling and then solves a constrained stochastic optimization problem by projected gradient method. This method attains a suboptimal convergence rate even under strong assumption on the objectives. Our second approach is an efficient primal-dual stochastic algorithm. It leverages on the theory of Lagrangian method in constrained optimization and attains the optimal convergence rate of O(1/\u221aT) in high probability for general Lipschitz continuous objectives.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "NEC Labs America, Inc"], "authors": ["Mehrdad Mahdavi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahdavi:Mehrdad", "Tianbao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Tianbao", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
