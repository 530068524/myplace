{"title": "Approximating Geometric Knapsack via L-Packings.", "fields": ["knapsack problem", "cardinality", "continuous knapsack problem", "polynomial time approximation scheme", "change making problem"], "abstract": "We study the two-dimensional geometric knapsack problem (2DK) in which we are given a set of n axis-aligned rectangular items, each one with an associated profit, and an axis-aligned square knapsack. The goal is to find a (non-overlapping) packing of a maximum profit subset of items inside the knapsack (without rotating items). The best-known polynomial-time approximation factor for this problem (even just in the cardinality case) is 2+\u03b5 [Jansen and Zhang, SODA 2004]. In this paper we break the 2 approximation barrier, achieving a polynomialtime 17/9 + \u03b5", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Max Planck Society", "University of Lugano", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Waldo G\u00e1lvez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=aacute=lvez:Waldo", "Fabrizio Grandoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grandoni_0001:Fabrizio", "Sandy Heydrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heydrich:Sandy", "Salvatore Ingala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ingala:Salvatore", "Arindam Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan_0001:Arindam", "Andreas Wiese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiese:Andreas"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
