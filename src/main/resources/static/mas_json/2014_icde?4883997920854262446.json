While the factual part of this information and the opinions of various experts are archived by sources such as Wikipedia and reputable news articles, the opinion of the general public is drowned out in a sea of noise and \u201cun-interesting\u201d information. In this demo we present Kondenzer - an offline system for condensing, archiving and visualizing social data. Specifically, we create digests of social data using a combination of filtering, duplicate removal and efficient clustering. This gives a condensed set of high quality data which is used to generate facets and create a collection that can be visualized using the PivotViewer control.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Omar Alonso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alonso:Omar", "Kartikay Khandelwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khandelwal:Kartikay"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
