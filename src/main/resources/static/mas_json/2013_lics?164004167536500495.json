This logic is strictly more expressive than standard C 2  and it is no longer a fragment of the first order logic. In particular, it can express that a structure is a ranked tree, a cycle or a connected graph of bounded degree. It is also strictly more expressive than the first-order logic with two variables and two successor relations of two finite linear orders. We give a decision procedure for the satisfiability problem for this logic. The procedure runs in NEXPTIME, which is optimal since the satisfiability problem for plain C 2  is NEXPTIME-complete.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw", "University of Wroc\u0142aw"], "authors": ["Witold Charatonik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charatonik:Witold", "Piotr Witkowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Witkowski_0001:Piotr"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
