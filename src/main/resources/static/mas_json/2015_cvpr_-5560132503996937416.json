We apply our algorithm to the problem of correcting mislabeled examples from image collections with ordered (e.g., real-valued, ordinal) labels. Compared to related methods for robust regression, our method achieves superior denoising accuracy on a variety of data sets, with label corruption levels as high as 80%. For a diverse set of widely-used, large-scale, publicly-available data sets, our approach results in image labels that more accurately describe the associated images.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Hui", "Richard Souvenir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Souvenir:Richard"], "pages": 9}
