{"title": "HERMES: aggregative LBS via a trajectory DB engine.", "fields": ["trajectory", "location based service", "query language", "sargable", "data mining"], "abstract": "We present HERMES, a prototype system based on a powerful query language for trajectory databases, which enables the support of aggregative Location-Based Services (LBS). The key observation that motivates HERMES is that the more the knowledge in hand about the trajectory of a mobile user, the better the exploitation of the advances in spatio-temporal query processing for providing intelligent LBS. HERMES is fully incorporated into a state-of-the-art Object-Relational DBMS, and its demonstration illustrates its flexibility and usefulness for delivering custom-defined LBS.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Piraeus", "University of Piraeus", "University of Piraeus", "University of Piraeus"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Nikos Pelekis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pelekis:Nikos", "Elias Frentzos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frentzos:Elias", "Nikos Giatrakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giatrakos:Nikos", "Yannis Theodoridis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theodoridis:Yannis"], "pages": 4}
