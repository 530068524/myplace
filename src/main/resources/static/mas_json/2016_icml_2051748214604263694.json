{"title": "Differentially Private Chi-Squared Hypothesis Testing: Goodness of Fit and Independence Testing.", "fields": ["categorical variable", "null hypothesis", "alternative hypothesis", "p rep", "multinomial distribution"], "abstract": "Hypothesis testing is a useful statistical tool in determining whether a given model should be rejected based on a sample from the population. Sample data may contain sensitive information about individuals, such as medical information. Thus it is important to design statistical tests that guarantee the privacy of subjects in the data. In this work, we study hypothesis testing subject to differential privacy, specifically chi-squared tests for goodness of fit for multinomial data and independence between two categorical variables.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Pennsylvania", "Harvard University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Marco Gaboardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gaboardi:Marco", "Hyun-Woo Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Hyun=Woo", "Ryan M.
