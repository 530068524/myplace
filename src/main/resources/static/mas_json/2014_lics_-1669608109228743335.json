{"title": "On the succinctness of query rewriting over shallow ontologies.", "fields": ["conjunctive query", "datalog", "hypergraph", "description logic", "succinctness"], "abstract": "We investigate the succinctness problem for conjunctive query rewritings over  OWL 2QL  ontologies of depth 1 and 2 by means of hypergraph programs computing Boolean functions. Both positive and negative results are obtained. We show that, over ontologies of depth 1, conjunctive queries have polynomial-size nonrecursive datalog rewritings; tree-shaped queries have polynomial positive existential rewritings; however, in the worst case, positive existential rewritings can be superpolynomial. Over ontologies of depth 2, positive existential and nonrecursive datalog rewritings of conjunctive queries can suffer an exponential blowup, while first-order rewritings can be superpolynomial unless NP \u2286 P/poly. We also analyse rewritings of tree-shaped queries over arbitrary ontologies and note that query entailment for such queries is fixed-parameter tractable.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of London", "University of London", "Steklov Mathematical Institute", "University of London"], "authors": ["Stanislav Kikot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kikot:Stanislav", "Roman Kontchakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontchakov:Roman", "Vladimir V.
