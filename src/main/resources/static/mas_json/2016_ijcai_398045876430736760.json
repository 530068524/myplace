{"title": "Strategic Voting with Incomplete Information.", "fields": ["bullet voting", "disapproval voting", "preferential block voting", "cardinal voting systems", "anti plurality voting"], "abstract": "Classical results in social choice theory on the susceptibility of voting rules to strategic manipulation make the assumption that the manipulator has complete information regarding the preferences of the other voters. In reality, however, voters only have incomplete information, which limits their ability to manipulate. We explore how these limitations affect both the manipulability of voting rules and the dynamics of systems in which voters may repeatedly update their own vote in reaction to the moves made by others. We focus on the Plurality, Veto, k-approval, Borda, Copeland, and Maximin voting rules, and consider several types of information that are natural in the context of these rules, namely information on the current front-runner, on the scores obtained by each alternative, and on the majority graph induced by the individual preferences.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Amsterdam", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "University of Southampton", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Ulle Endriss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Endriss:Ulle", "Svetlana Obraztsova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Obraztsova:Svetlana", "Maria Polukarov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polukarov:Maria", "Jeffrey S.
