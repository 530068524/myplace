{"title": "Domain-size pooling in local descriptors: DSP-SIFT.", "fields": ["visual descriptors", "digital signal processing", "convolutional neural network", "scale invariant feature transform", "pooling"], "abstract": "We introduce a simple modification of local image descriptors, such as SIFT, based on pooling gradient orientations across different domain sizes, in addition to spatial locations. The resulting descriptor, which we call DSP-SIFT, outperforms other methods in wide-baseline matching benchmarks, including those based on convolutional neural networks, despite having the same dimension of SIFT and requiring no training.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jingming Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jingming", "Stefano Soatto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soatto:Stefano"], "pages": 10}
