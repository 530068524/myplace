{"title": "NEOFog: Nonvolatility-Exploiting Optimizations for Fog Computing.", "fields": ["multiplexing", "energy harvesting", "systems architecture", "computation", "load balancing"], "abstract": "Nonvolatile processors have emerged as one of the promising solutions for energy harvesting scenarios, among which Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) provide some of the most important applications. In a typical distributed sensing system, due to difference in location, energy harvester angles, power sources, etc. different nodes may have different amount of energy ready for use. While prior approaches have examined these challenges, they have not done so in the context of the features offered by nonvolatile computing approaches, which disrupt certain foundational assumptions. We propose a new set of nonvolatility-exploiting optimizations and embody them in the NEOFog system architecture. We discuss shifts in the tradeoffs in data and program distribution for nonvolatile processing-based WSNs, showing how non-volatile processing and non-volatile RF support alter the benefits of computation and communication-centric approaches. We also propose a new algorithm specific to nonvolatile sensing systems for load balancing both computation and communication demands. Collectively, the NV-aware optimizations in NEOFog increase the ability to perform in-fog processing by 4.2X and can increase this to 8X if virtualized nodes are 3X multiplexed.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Kaisheng Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Kaisheng", "Xueqing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xueqing", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kandemir:Mahmut_Taylan", "Jack Sampson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sampson:Jack", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanan:Vijaykrishnan", "Jinyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0002:Jinyang", "Tongda Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Tongda", "Zhibo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhibo", "Yongpan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yongpan", "Yuan Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Yuan"], "pages": 15}
