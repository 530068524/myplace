In this paper, we examine skin as an interactive input surface for gestural 3D modeling-to-fabrication systems. When used as both the input surface and base canvas for digital design, skin-input can enable non-experts users to intuitively create precise forms around highly complex physical contexts: our own bodies. In this paper, we outline design considerations when creating interfaces for such systems. We then discuss interaction techniques for three different modes of skin-centric modeling: direct, parametric, and generative. We also present Tactum, a new fabrication-aware design system that captures a user's skin-centric gestures for 3D modeling directly on the body. Lastly, we show sample artifacts generated with our system, and share a set of observations from design professionals.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Autodesk", "Autodesk"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Madeline Gannon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gannon:Madeline", "Tovi Grossman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grossman:Tovi", "George W.
