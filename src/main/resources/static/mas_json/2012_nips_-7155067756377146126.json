The model is based on the theory of completely random measures and is able to handle a potentially infinite number of nodes. We show that the model has appealing properties and in particular it may exhibit a power-law behavior. We derive a posterior characterization, a generative process for network growth, and a simple Gibbs sampler for posterior simulation. Our model is shown to be well fitted to several real-world social networks.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Bordeaux"], "authors": ["Francois Caron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caron:Francois"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
