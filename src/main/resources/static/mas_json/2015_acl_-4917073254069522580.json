We propose a novel sentiment and aspect extraction model based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines to jointly address these two tasks in an unsupervised setting. This model reflects the generation process of reviews by introducing a heterogeneous structure into the hidden layer and incorporating informative priors. Experiments show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Tsinghua University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Linlin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Linlin", "Kang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Kang", "Zhu Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Zhu", "Jun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Jun", "Gerard de Melo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melo:Gerard_de"], "pages": 10}
