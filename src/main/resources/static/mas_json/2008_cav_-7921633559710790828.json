Functional correctness of power gating is usually checked as part of system-level verification, where the most widely used technique is simulation using pseudo-random stimuli. We propose instead to perform a sequential equivalence check between the power gated design and a version of itself in which power gating is disabled. We take a compositional approach that looks for partial equivalence of each unit under a suitable set of assumptions, guaranteed by the neighboring units. We make use of so-called circular reasoning rules to compose the partial equivalences proved on the individual units back into total equivalence on the whole chip.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Cindy Eisner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisner:Cindy", "Amir Nahir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nahir:Amir", "Karen Yorav.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yorav:Karen"], "pages": 13}
