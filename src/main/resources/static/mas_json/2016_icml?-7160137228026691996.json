These algorithms have been designed to handle general likelihood models by linearizing them using a Taylor series or the Unscented Transform in a variational inference framework. We build upon random feature approximations of Gaussian process covariance functions and show that, on small-scale single-task problems, our methods can attain similar performance as the original algorithms while having less computational cost. We also evaluate our methods at a larger scale on MNIST and on a seismic inversion which is inherently a multi-task problem.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "NICTA", "NICTA"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Edwin V.
