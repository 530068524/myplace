We present Vizmo as a new way of browsing video games based on their visual style and mood. In order to test the usability and usefulness of Vizmo, we asked 19 video game experts to evaluate their interaction with the tool. The results show that experts perceived Vizmo as a novel and aesthetically pleasing game discovery tool which would be most useful for game research on historical and aesthetic aspects. We discuss five key points for improving the design of Vizmo as well as our future plan for the next iteration of this prototype game browser.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jin Ha Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jin_Ha", "Sungsoo (Ray) Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Sungsoo_=Ray=", "Hyerim Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Hyerim", "Yea-Seul Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Yea=Seul"], "pages": 4}
