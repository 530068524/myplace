{"title": "Balancing design tensions: iterative display design to support ad hoc and multidisciplinary medical teamwork.", "fields": ["multidisciplinary approach", "heuristic evaluation", "teamwork", "participatory design", "resuscitation"], "abstract": "In this paper, we describe how we developed an information display prototype for trauma resuscitation teams based on design ideas and feedback from clinicians. Our approach is grounded in participatory design, emphasizing the importance of gaining long-term commitment from clinicians in system development. Through a series of participatory design workshops, heuristic evaluation, and simulated resuscitation sessions, we identified the main information features to include on our display. Our results focus on how we balanced the design tensions that emerged when addressing the ad hoc, hierarchical, and multidisciplinary nature of trauma teamwork. We discuss the implications of balancing role-based differences for each information feature, as well as two major design tensions: process-based vs. state-based designs and role-based vs. team-based displays.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University", "University of California, San Diego", "Rutgers University", "Drexel University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Diana S.
