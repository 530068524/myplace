{"title": "Simultaneous correspondence and non-rigid 3D reconstruction of the coronary tree from single X-ray images.", "fields": ["training set", "generative grammar", "solid modeling", "3d reconstruction", "rigidity"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach to simultaneously reconstruct the 3D structure of a non-rigid coronary tree and estimate point correspondences between an input X-ray image and a reference 3D shape. At the core of our approach lies an optimization scheme that iteratively fits a generative 3D model of increasing complexity and guides the matching process. As a result, and in contrast to existing approaches that assume rigidity or quasi-rigidity of the structure, our method is able to retrieve large non-linear deformations even when the input data is corrupted by the presence of noise and partial occlusions. We extensively evaluate our approach under synthetic and real data and demonstrate a remarkable improvement compared to state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Spanish National Research Council", "Centre de Visi\u00f3 ... arcelona, Spain", "Hospital de la  ... arcelona, Spain", "Centre de Visi\u00f3 ... arcelona, Spain", "Hospital de la  ... arcelona, Spain"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Eduard Serradell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serradell:Eduard", "Adriana Romero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romero:Adriana", "Ruben Leta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leta:Ruben", "Carlo Gatta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gatta:Carlo", "Francesc Moreno-Noguer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moreno=Noguer:Francesc"], "pages": 8}
