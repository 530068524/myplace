In this paper we investigate an important but often overlooked feature of ads in mobile apps (mostly absent in traditional web ads), that of ad refreshes: A user is shown a stream of banner ads during the app session, in which each ad is displayed in the ad slot for a certain amount of time (known as the refresh rate) before the ad-slot is refreshed to the next ad. Data analysis on our large-scale experiments that vary refresh rates reveals a surprising result, that cannot be explained by existing user click models: The total number of clicks is almost independent of the refresh rate. We propose a new, natural, two-phase click model for this setting that explains this independence, as well as our measurements of the click-through rate as a function of the impression\u2019s time-on-screen and of ad-repeat counts. The new click model leads to a clean formulation of the problem of auctioning the entire user-session: i.e., determining online, both the sequence of winning ads as well as the amount of time to display each one. We complement the theoretical auction design with results from a live-traffic experiment with its implementation. Our experiments and analysis provide the theoretical foundation for Admob\u2019s \u201c\u201dGoogle-optimized refresh rate\u201d\u201d feature, used by thousands of mobile apps for better monetization of ads shown to millions of users.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Florin Constantin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Constantin:Florin", "Christopher Harris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harris:Christopher", "Samuel Ieong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ieong:Samuel", "Aranyak Mehta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehta:Aranyak", "Xi Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Xi"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
