{"title": "Towards an holistic view of the energy and environmental impacts of domestic media and IT.", "fields": ["digital media", "life cycle assessment", "information technology", "greenhouse gas", "sustainability"], "abstract": "To date, research in sustainable HCI has dealt with eco-feedback, usage and recycling of appliances within the home, and longevity of portable electronics such as mobile phones. However, there seems to be less awareness of the energy and greenhouse emissions impacts of domestic consumer electronics and information technology. Such awareness is needed to inform HCI sustainability researchers on how best to prioritise efforts around digital media and IT. Grounded in inventories, interview and plug energy data from 33 undergraduate student participants, our findings provide the context for assessing approaches to reducing the energy and carbon emissions of media and IT in the home. In the paper, we use the findings to discuss and inform more fruitful directions that sustainable HCI research might take, and we quantify how various strategies might have modified the energy and emissions impacts for our participants.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Oliver Bates.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bates:Oliver", "Mike Hazas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazas:Mike", "Adrian Friday.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friday:Adrian", "Janine Morley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morley:Janine", "Adrian K.
