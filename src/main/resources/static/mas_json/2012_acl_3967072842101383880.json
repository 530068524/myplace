{"title": "Collective Generation of Natural Image Descriptions.", "fields": ["machine learning", "natural language processing", "natural language", "composition", "constrained optimization"], "abstract": "We present a holistic data-driven approach to image description generation, exploiting the vast amount of (noisy) parallel image data and associated natural language descriptions available on the web. More specifically, given a query image, we retrieve existing human-composed phrases used to describe visually similar images, then selectively combine those phrases to generate a novel description for the query image. We cast the generation process as constraint optimization problems, collectively incorporating multiple interconnected aspects of language composition for content planning, surface realization and discourse structure. Evaluation by human annotators indicates that our final system generates more semantically correct and linguistically appealing descriptions than two nontrivial baselines.", "citation": "Citations (215)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Polina Kuznetsova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuznetsova:Polina", "Vicente Ordonez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ordonez:Vicente", "Alexander C.
