The inherent graph-like structure of object-oriented systems calls for the application of the corresponding methods and tools to analyze software evolution. In this paper we investigate network properties of two open-source systems and observe interesting phenomena regarding their growth. Relating the observed evolutionary trends to principles and laws of software design enables a high-level assessment of tendencies in the underlying design quality.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Macedonia", "University of Macedonia"], "authors": ["Alexander Chatzigeorgiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatzigeorgiou:Alexander", "George Melas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melas:George"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
