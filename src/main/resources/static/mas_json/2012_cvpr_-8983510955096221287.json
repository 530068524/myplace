Video synopsis, an innovation proposed by Peleg and his colleagues, is aimed for fast browsing by shortening the video into a synopsis while keeping activities in video captured by a camera. However, the current techniques are offline methods requiring that all the video data be ready for the processing, and are expensive in time and space. In this paper, we propose an online and efficient solution, and its supporting algorithms to overcome the problems. The method adopts an online content-aware approach in a step-wise manner, hence applicable to endless video, with less computational cost. Moreover, we propose a novel tracking method, called sticky tracking, to achieve high-quality visualization. The system can achieve a faster-than-real-time speed with a multi-core CPU implementation. The advantages are demonstrated by extensive experiments with a wide variety of videos. The proposed solution and algorithms could be integrated with surveillance cameras, and impact the way that surveillance videos are recorded.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shikun Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Shikun", "Zhen Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Zhen", "Dong Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Dong", "Stan Z.
