We try to mimic and automate this human thinking process. More precisely, we introduce a new and useful task of locating an user in the floor-plan, by using only a camera and a floor-plan without any other prior information. We address the problem with a novel matching-localization algorithm that is inspired by human logic. We demonstrate through experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art floor-plan-based localization methods by a large margin, while also being highly efficient for real-time applications.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Hang Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Hang", "Dong Ki Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Dong_Ki", "Tsuhan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Tsuhan"], "pages": 9}
