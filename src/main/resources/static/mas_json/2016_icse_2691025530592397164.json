{"title": "Mining sandboxes.", "fields": ["sandbox", "end user", "malware", "android"], "abstract": "We present  sandbox mining , a technique to confine an application to resources accessed during automatic testing. Sandbox mining first explores software behavior by means of  automatic test generation , and extracts the set of resources accessed during these tests. This set is then used as a  sandbox , blocking access to resources not used during testing. The mined sandbox thus protects against  behavior changes  such as the activation of latent malware, infections, targeted attacks, or malicious updates.   The use of test generation makes sandbox mining a fully automatic process that can be run by vendors and end users alike. Our BOXMATE prototype requires less than one hour to extract a sandbox from an Android app, with few to no confirmations required for frequently used functionality.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Center for IT-S ... r\u00fccken, Germany", "Center for IT-S ... r\u00fccken, Germany", "Center for IT-S ... r\u00fccken, Germany"], "authors": ["Konrad Jamrozik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jamrozik:Konrad", "Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Styp=Rekowsky:Philipp_von", "Andreas Zeller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeller:Andreas"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
