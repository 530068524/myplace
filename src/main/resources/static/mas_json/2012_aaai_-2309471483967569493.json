{"title": "Markov Network Structure Learning: A Randomized Feature Generation Approach.", "fields": ["maximum entropy markov model", "variable order markov model", "markov random field", "markov algorithm", "variable order bayesian network"], "abstract": "The structure of a Markov network is typically learned in one of two ways. The first approach is to treat this task as a global search problem. However, these algorithms are slow as they require running the expensive operation of weight (i.e., parameter) learning many times. The second approach involves learning a set of local models and then combining them into a global model. However, it can be computationally expensive to learn the local models for datasets that contain a large number of variables and/or examples. This paper pursues a third approach that views Markov network structure learning as a feature generation problem. The algorithm combines a data-driven, specific-to-general search strategy with randomization to quickly generate a large set of candidate features that all have support in the data. It uses weight learning, with L1 regularization, to select a subset of generated features to include in the model. On a large empirical study, we find that our algorithm is equivalently accurate to other state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting a much faster run time.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "authors": ["Jan Van Haaren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haaren:Jan_Van", "Jesse Davis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Davis:Jesse"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
