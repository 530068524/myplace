Working in the framework of RKHS theory with vector-valued functions, we establish a new representer theorem devoted to semi-supervised least square regression. We then apply it to get a new model (POKR: Penalized Output Kernel Regression) and show its relevance using numerical experiments on artificial networks and two real applications using a very low percentage of labeled data in a transductive setting.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["IBISC, EA 4526, ... y cedex, France", "ENSIIE, F?91025 ... y cedex, France", "IBISC, EA 4526, ... y cedex, France"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["C\u00e9line Brouard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brouard:C=eacute=line", "Florence d'Alch\u00e9-Buc.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/d=Alch=eacute==Buc:Florence", "Marie Szafranski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szafranski:Marie"], "pages": 8}
