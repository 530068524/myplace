A novel photometric calibration technique allows calibration of scenes containing multiple piecewise constant chromaticities. This method estimates per-pixel photometric properties, then uses a RANSAC-based approach to estimate the dominant chromaticities in the scene. A likelihood term is developed linking surface normal, image intensity and photometric properties, which allows estimating the number of chromaticities present in a scene to be framed as a model estimation problem. The Bayesian Information Criterion is applied to automatically estimate the number of chromaticities present during calibration. A two-camera stereo system provides low resolution geometry, allowing the likelihood term to be used in segmenting new images into regions of constant chromaticity. This segmentation is carried out in a Markov Random Field framework and allows the correct photometric properties to be used at each pixel to estimate a dense normal map. Results are shown on several challenging real-world sequences, demonstrating state-of-the-art results using only two cameras and three light sources. Quantitative evaluation is provided against synthetic ground truth data.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Toshiba", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Robert Anderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anderson:Robert", "Bj\u00f6rn Stenger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stenger:Bj=ouml=rn", "Roberto Cipolla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cipolla:Roberto"], "pages": 8}
