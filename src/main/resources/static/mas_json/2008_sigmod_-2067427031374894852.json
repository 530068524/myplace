We will demonstrate a complete game built using the system, and show how complex game behavior can be expressed in a declarative scripting language. The demo will also illustrate the workflow necessary to modify a game and include a visualization of the relational operations that are executed as the game runs.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Robert Albright.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albright:Robert", "Alan J.
