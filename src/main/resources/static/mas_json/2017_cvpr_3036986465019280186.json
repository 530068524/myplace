{"title": "Self-Supervised Learning of Visual Features through Embedding Images into Text Topic Spaces.", "fields": ["text corpus", "contextual image classification", "supervised learning", "topic model", "scratch"], "abstract": "End-to-end training from scratch of current deep architectures for new computer vision problems would require Imagenet-scale datasets, and this is not always possible. In this paper we present a method that is able to take advantage of freely available multi-modal content to train computer vision algorithms without human supervision. We put forward the idea of performing self-supervised learning of visual features by mining a large scale corpus of multi-modal (text and image) documents. We show that discriminative visual features can be learnt efficiently by training a CNN to predict the semantic context in which a particular image is more probable to appear as an illustration. For this we leverage the hidden semantic structures discovered in the text corpus with a well-known topic modeling technique. Our experiments demonstrate state of the art performance in image classification, object detection, and multi-modal retrieval compared to recent self-supervised or natural-supervised approaches.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Barcelona", "International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad", "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "International Institute of Information Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Lluis Gomez-Bigorda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gomez=Bigorda:Lluis", "Yash Patel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patel:Yash", "Mar\u00e7al Rusi\u00f1ol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rusi=ntilde=ol:Mar=ccedil=al", "Dimosthenis Karatzas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karatzas:Dimosthenis", "C.
