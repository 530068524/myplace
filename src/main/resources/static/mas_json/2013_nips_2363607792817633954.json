Our model integrates two basic properties of nodes in social networks: homophily and preferential connection to popular nodes. We develop a scalable algorithm for posterior inference, based on a novel nonconjugate variant of stochastic variational inference. We evaluate the link prediction accuracy of our algorithm on nine real-world networks with up to 60,000 nodes, and on simulated networks with degree distributions that follow a power law. We demonstrate that the AMP predicts significantly better than the MMSB.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Prem Gopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalan:Prem", "Chong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Chong", "David M.
