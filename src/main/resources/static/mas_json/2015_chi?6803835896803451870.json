{"title": "On the Effectiveness of Pattern Lock Strength Meters: Measuring the Strength of Real World Pattern Locks.", "fields": ["lock", "password", "ecological validity", "meter"], "abstract": "We propose an effective pattern lock strength meter to help users choose stronger pattern locks on Android devices. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed meter with a real world dataset (i.e., with complete ecological validity), we created an Android application called EnCloud that allows users to encrypt their Dropbox files. 101 pattern locks generated by real EnCloud users were collected and analyzed, where some portion of the users were provided with the meter support. Our statistical analysis indicates that about 10% of the pattern locks that were generated without the meter support could be compromised through just 16 guessing attempts. As for the pattern locks that were generated with the meter support, that number goes up to 48 guessing attempts, showing significant improvement in security. Our recommendation is to implement a strength meter in the next version of Android.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Sungkyunkwan University", "Sungkyunkwan University", "Sungkyunkwan University", "Sungkyunkwan University", "Honeywell"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Youngbae Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Youngbae", "Geumhwan Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Geumhwan", "Seongyeol Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Seongyeol", "Hyoungshick Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyoungshick", "Jun Ho Huh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huh:Jun_Ho"], "pages": 10}
