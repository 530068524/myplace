Given an unlabeled pool of multi-object images, we first detect any visual clusters present among their sub-regions, where inter-region similarity is measured according to both appearance and contextual layout. Then, using each initial segment as a seed, we solve a graph cuts problem to refine its boundary \u2014 enforcing preferences to include nearby regions that agree with an ensemble of representative regions discovered for that cluster, and exclude those regions that resemble familiar objects. Through extensive experiments, we show that the segmentations computed jointly on the collection agree more closely with true object boundaries, when compared to either a bottom-up baseline or a graph cuts foreground segmentation that can only access cues from a single image.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yong Jae Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yong_Jae", "Kristen Grauman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grauman:Kristen"], "pages": 8}
