{"title": "Recreating living experiences from past memories through virtual worlds for people with dementia.", "fields": ["virtual tour", "psychology of self", "dementia", "reminiscence", "metaverse"], "abstract": "This paper describes a study aimed to understand the use of 3D virtual world (VW) technology to support life engagement for people with dementia in long-term care. Three versions of VW prototypes (reminiscence room, virtual tour and gardening) utilising gestured-base interaction were developed iteratively. These prototypes were tested with older residents (80+) with dementia in care homes and their caregivers. Data collection was based on observations of how the residents and care staff interacted collaboratively with the VW. We discussed in depth the use of VWs in stimulating past memories and how this technology could help enhance their sense of self through various means. We also highlighted key approaches in designing VWs to sustain attention, create ludic experiences and facilitate interaction for older people with dementia.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "University of Kent"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Panote Siriaraya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siriaraya:Panote", "Chee Siang Ang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ang:Chee_Siang"], "pages": 10}
