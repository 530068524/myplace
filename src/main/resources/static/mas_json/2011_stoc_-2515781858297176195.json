A multicut is a subset F of E such that every request xy of R is cut by F, i.e. every xy-path of G intersects F. We show that there exists an O(f(k)n c ) algorithm which decides if there exists a multicut of size at most k. In other words, the Multicut problem parameterized by the solution size k is Fixed-Parameter Tractable.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["LIRMM, Montpellier, France", "LIRMM, Montpellier, France", "LIRMM, Montpellier, France"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Nicolas Bousquet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bousquet:Nicolas", "Jean Daligault.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daligault:Jean", "St\u00e9phan Thomass\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomass=eacute=:St=eacute=phan"], "pages": 10}
