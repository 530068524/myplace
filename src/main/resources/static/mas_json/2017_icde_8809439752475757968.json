Given a collection of set records and a query, the exact set similarity search aims at finding all the records that are similar to the query from the collection. Existing methods adopt a filter-and-verify framework, which make use of inverted indexes. However, as the complexity of verification is rather low for setbased similarity metrics, they always fail to make a good tradeoff between filter power and filter cost. In this paper, we proposed an efficient framework for exact set similarity search based on tree index structure. We defined a hash-based ordering to effectively import data into the index structure and then make optimizations to reduce the filter cost. To further improve the filter power, we proposed a dynamic algorithm to partition the dataset into several parts and propose a multiple-index framework. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Yong", "Xiuxing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiuxing", "Jin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0011:Jin", "Ying Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0015:Ying", "Chunxiao Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Chunxiao", "Xiaojie Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Xiaojie"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
