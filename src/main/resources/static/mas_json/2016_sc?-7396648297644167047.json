Our algorithm operates directly upon the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) sparse matrix format without preprocessing, inspection, reformatting, or supplemental encoding. Regardless of nonzero structure, our equitable 2D merge-based decomposition tightly bounds the workload assigned to each processing element. Furthermore, our technique is suitable for recursively partitioning CSR datasets themselves into multi-scale, distributed, NUMA, and GPU environments that are constrained by fixed-size local memories.   We evaluate our method on both CPU and GPU microarchitectures across a very large corpus of diverse sparse matrix datasets. We show that traditional CsrMV methods are inconsistent performers, often subject to order-of-magnitude performance variation across similarly-sized datasets. In comparison, our method provides predictable performance that is substantially uncorrelated to the distribution of nonzeros among rows and broadly improves upon that of current CsrMV methods.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Nvidia", "Nvidia"], "authors": ["Duane Merrill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Merrill:Duane", "Michael Garland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garland:Michael"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
