{"title": "Data-driven precondition inference with learned features.", "fields": ["feature learning", "precondition", "loop invariant", "data driven", "predicate"], "abstract": "We extend the data-driven approach to inferring preconditions for code from a set of test executions. Prior work requires a fixed set of features, atomic predicates that define the search space of possible preconditions, to be specified in advance. In contrast, we introduce a technique for on-demand feature learning, which automatically expands the search space of candidate preconditions in a targeted manner as necessary. We have instantiated our approach in a tool called PIE. In addition to making precondition inference more expressive, we show how to apply our feature-learning technique to the setting of data-driven loop invariant inference. We evaluate our approach by using PIE to infer rich preconditions for black-box OCaml library functions and using our loop-invariant inference algorithm as part of an automatic program verifier for C++ programs.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Stanford University", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Saswat Padhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padhi:Saswat", "Rahul Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma_0001:Rahul", "Todd D.
