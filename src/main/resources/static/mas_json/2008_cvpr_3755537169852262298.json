Specifically, we address the computational challenges of nonlinear dimensionality reduction via Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps, using a graph containing about 18 million nodes and 65 million edges. Since most manifold learning techniques rely on spectral decomposition, we first analyze two approximate spectral decomposition techniques for large dense matrices (Nystrom and column-sampling), providing the first direct theoretical and empirical comparison between these techniques. We next show extensive experiments on learning low-dimensional embeddings for two large face datasets: CMU-PIE (35 thousand faces) and a web dataset (18 million faces). Our comparisons show that the Nystrom approximation is superior to the column-sampling method. Furthermore, approximate Isomap tends to perform better than Laplacian Eigenmaps on both clustering and classification with the labeled CMU-PIE dataset.", "citation": "Citations (185)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ameet Talwalkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talwalkar:Ameet", "Sanjiv Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Sanjiv", "Henry A.
