The system uses animation to display the dynamism of crowd on campus based on the internet usage behavior in different buildings and time periods. The sensed crowd level is comparable to the student registration information. This developed system can be used to sense the crowd level and can be beneficial to future studies in campus behavior or even city-level behavior, and management of internet usage and crowd on campus such as scheduling optimization, campus traffic management and planning.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chiang Mai University", "Chiang Mai University", "Chiang Mai University"], "authors": ["Adiporl Binthaisong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Binthaisong:Adiporl", "Jaruwan Srichan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srichan:Jaruwan", "Santi Phithakkitnukoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phithakkitnukoon:Santi"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
