{"title": "Reflections on, and Predictions for, Support Systems for the Development of Programs.", "fields": ["software development", "open source hardware", "computer aided software engineering", "software system", "systems development life cycle"], "abstract": "My first attempt to build a \"formal development support system\" was in IBM in the 1970s; more public is the mural system we built in Manchester; the Rodin (EU) project developed a set of open source tools that are now being used in the (EU) DEPLOY project. These attempts give me some perspective from which to predict what sort of tool will finally make the difference to software developers that CAD systems have made in hardware design.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Newcastle University"], "authors": ["Cliff B.
