To answer the question, we conducted a series of interviews with thirteen administrators who manage access-control policy for either a file system or a physical space. Based on these interviews we identified three sets of real-world requirements that are either ignored or inadequately addressed by technology: 1) policies are made/implemented by multiple people; 2) policy makers are distinct from policy implementers; and 3) access-control systems don't always have the capability to implement the desired policy. We present our interview results and propose several possible solutions to address the observed issues.", "citation": "Citations (163)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Lujo Bauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauer:Lujo", "Lorrie Faith Cranor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cranor:Lorrie_Faith", "Robert W.
