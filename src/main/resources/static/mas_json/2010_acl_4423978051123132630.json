{"title": "Optimal Rank Reduction for Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems with Fan-Out Two.", "fields": ["rewriting", "formalism", "fan out", "discontinuity", "parsing"], "abstract": "Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRSs) are a grammar formalism capable of modeling discontinuous phrases. Many parsing applications use LCFRSs where the fan-out (a measure of the discontinuity of phrases) does not exceed 2. We present an efficient algorithm for optimal reduction of the length of production right-hand side in LCFRSs with fan-out at most 2. This results in asymptotical running time improvement for known parsing algorithms for this class.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Padua"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Beno\u00eet Sagot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sagot:Beno=icirc=t", "Giorgio Satta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satta:Giorgio"], "pages": 9}
