While effective algorithms for two-way partitioning exist, multiway partitioning is much more challenging. We introduce an improved algorithm for optimal multiway partitioning, by combining several existing algorithms with some new extensions. We test our algorithm for partitioning 31-bit integers from three to ten ways, and demonstrate orders of magnitude speedup over the previous state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Richard E.
