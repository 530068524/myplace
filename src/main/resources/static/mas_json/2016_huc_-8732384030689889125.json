We collected use traces from real-world users during a 3-month naturalistic deployment via an app-store. These traces were used to develop an analytical model which can be used to probabilistically model or predict, at runtime, how a user interacts with their mobile phone, and for how long. Unlike classification-driven machine learning approaches, our analytical model can be interrogated under unlimited conditions, making it suitable for a wide range of applications including more realistic automated testing and improving operating system management of resources.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "authors": ["Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis", "Denzil Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Denzil", "Jorge Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves:Jorge", "Simo Hosio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosio:Simo"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
