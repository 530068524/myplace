{"title": "CLOTHO: saving programs from malformed strings and incorrect string-handling.", "fields": ["logic programming", "program analysis", "crash", "strings", "string"], "abstract": "Software is susceptible to malformed data originating from untrusted sources. Occasionally the programming logic or constructs used are inappropriate to handle the varied constraints imposed by legal and well-formed data. Consequently, softwares may produce unexpected results or even crash. In this paper, we present CLOTHO, a novel hybrid approach that saves such softwares from crashing when failures originate from malformed strings or inappropriate handling of strings. CLOTHO statically analyses a program to identify statements that are vulnerable to failures related to associated string data. CLOTHO then generates patches that are likely to satisfy constraints on the data, and in case of failures produces program behavior which would be close to the expected. The precision of the patches is improved with the help of a dynamic analysis. We have implemented CLOTHO for the JAVA String API, and our evaluation based on several popular open-source libraries shows that CLOTHO generates patches that are semantically similar to the patches generated by the programmers in the later versions. Additionally, these patches are activated only when a failure is detected, and thus CLOTHO incurs no runtime overhead during normal execution, and negligible overhead in case of failures.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Xerox", "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology", "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology", "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology"], "authors": ["Aritra Dhar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhar:Aritra", "Rahul Purandare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Purandare:Rahul", "Mohan Dhawan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhawan:Mohan", "Suresh Rangaswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangaswamy:Suresh"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
