A realistic way of realising sufficiently scalable ontology-based data access in practice is by reduction to querying relational databases. In this paper, we describe the combined approach, which incorporates the information given by the ontology into the data and employs query rewriting to eliminate spurious answers. We illustrate this approach for ontologies given in the DL-Lite family of description logics and briefly discuss the results obtained for the EL family.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Birkbeck, University of London", "University of Bremen", "University of Waterloo", "University of Liverpool", "Birkbeck, University of London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Roman Kontchakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontchakov:Roman", "Carsten Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutz:Carsten", "David Toman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toman:David", "Frank Wolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolter:Frank", "Michael Zakharyaschev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zakharyaschev:Michael"], "pages": 6}
