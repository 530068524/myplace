To help customers pick a cloud that fits their needs, we develop CloudCmp, a systematic comparator of the performance and cost of cloud providers. CloudCmp measures the elastic computing, persistent storage, and networking services offered by a cloud along metrics that directly reflect their impact on the performance of customer applications. CloudCmp strives to ensure fairness, representativeness, and compliance of these measurements while limiting measurement cost. Applying CloudCmp to four cloud providers that together account for most of the cloud customers today, we find that their offered services vary widely in performance and costs, underscoring the need for thoughtful provider selection. From case studies on three representative cloud applications, we show that CloudCmp can guide customers in selecting the best-performing provider for their applications.", "citation": "Citations (941)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Melbourne", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "IBM", "IBM", "European Bioinformatics Institute", "European Bioinformatics Institute", "European Bioinformatics Institute", "SRI International", "SRI International", "MANJRASOFT PTY  ...
