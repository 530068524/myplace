APlug suggests the best decomposition of the original computation into smaller tasks and the best number of CPUs to use, in order to meet user-specific constraints. We show that the problem is not trivial because there is large variability in the execution time of tasks, and it is possible for a task to occupy a CPU by performing useless computations. APlug collects a sample of task execution times and builds a model, which is then used by a discrete event simulator to calculate the optimal parameters. We provide a C++ API and a stand-alone implementation of APlug, and we integrate it with three typical applications from computational chemistry, bioinformatics, and data mining. A scenario for optimizing resources utilization is used to demonstrate our framework. We run experiments on 16,384 CPUs on a supercomputer, 480 cores on a Linux cluster and 80 cores on Amazon EC2, and show that APlug is very accurate with minimal overhead.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Majed Sahli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahli:Majed", "Essam Mansour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mansour:Essam", "Tariq Alturkestani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alturkestani:Tariq", "Panos Kalnis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalnis:Panos"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
