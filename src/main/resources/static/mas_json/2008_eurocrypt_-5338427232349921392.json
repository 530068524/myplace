We provide explicit formulae for isogenies with kernel isomorphic to\u00a0(\u2124/2\u2124)3 (over an algebraic closure of the base field) for any hyperelliptic genus\u00a03 curve over a field of characteristic not\u00a02 or\u00a03. These isogenies are rational for a positive fraction of all hyperelliptic genus\u00a03 curves defined over a finite field of characteristic\u00a0p>3. Subject to reasonable assumptions, our constructions give an explicit and efficient reduction of instances of the DLP from hyperelliptic to non-hyperelliptic Jacobians for around\u00a018.57% of all hyperelliptic genus\u00a03 curves over a given finite field. We conclude with a discussion on extending these ideas to isogenies with more general kernels.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Benjamin A.
