{"title": "On Multilabel Classification and Ranking with Partial Feedback.", "fields": ["ranking", "pattern recognition", "linear model", "regret", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present a novel multilabel/ranking algorithm working in partial information settings. The algorithm is based on 2nd-order descent methods, and relies on upper-confidence bounds to trade-off exploration and exploitation. We analyze this algorithm in a partial adversarial setting, where covariates can be adversarial, but multilabel probabilities are ruled by (generalized) linear models. We show O(T1/2 log T) regret bounds, which improve in several ways on the existing results. We test the effectiveness of our upper-confidence scheme by contrasting against full-information baselines on real-world multilabel datasets, often obtaining comparable performance.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["DiSTA, Universi ... nsubria, Italy", "TTI Chicago"], "authors": ["Claudio Gentile.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentile:Claudio", "Francesco Orabona.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orabona:Francesco"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
