{"title": "Guidelines are only half of the story: accessibility problems encountered by blind users on the web.", "fields": ["web content accessibility guidelines", "web accessibility initiative", "web standards", "web design", "web accessibility"], "abstract": "This paper describes an empirical study of the problems encountered by 32 blind users on the Web. Task-based user evaluations were undertaken on 16 websites, yielding 1383 instances of user problems. The results showed that only 50.4% of the problems encountered by users were covered by Success Criteria in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0). For user problems that were covered by WCAG 2.0, 16.7% of websites implemented techniques recommended in WCAG 2.0 but the techniques did not solve the problems. These results show that few developers are implementing the current version of WCAG, and even when the guidelines are implemented on websites there is little indication that people with disabilities will encounter fewer problems. The paper closes by discussing the implications of this study for future research and practice. In particular, it discusses the need to move away from a problem-based approach towards a design principle approach for web accessibility.", "citation": "Citations (153)", "departments": ["University of York", "University of York", "University of York", "University of York"], "authors": ["Christopher Power.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Power:Christopher", "Andr\u00e9 Pimenta Freire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freire:Andr=eacute=_Pimenta", "Helen Petrie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrie:Helen", "David Swallow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swallow:David"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
