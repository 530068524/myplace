It encodes the original label space to a low-dimensional latent space and uses a decoding process for recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel method termed FaIE to perform LSDR via Feature-aware Implicit label space Encoding. Unlike most previous work, the proposed FaIE makes no assumptions about the encoding process and directly learns a code matrix, i.e. the encoding result of some implicit encoding function, and a linear decoding matrix. To learn both matrices, FaIE jointly maximizes the recoverability of the original label space from the latent space, and the predictability of the latent space from the feature space, thus making itself feature-aware. FaIE can also be specified to learn an explicit encoding function, and extended with kernel tricks to handle non-linear correlations between the feature space and the latent space. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets well demonstrate its effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Zijia Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zijia", "Guiguang Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Guiguang", "Mingqing Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Mingqing", "Jianmin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Jianmin"], "pages": 9}
