{"title": "Supervised Bipartite Graph Inference.", "fields": ["foster graph", "simplex graph", "folded cube graph", "quartic graph", "edge transitive graph"], "abstract": "We formulate the problem of bipartite graph inference as a supervised learning problem, and propose a new method to solve it from the viewpoint of distance metric learning. The method involves the learning of two mappings of the heterogeneous objects to a unified Euclidean space representing the network topology of the bipartite graph, where the graph is easy to infer. The algorithm can be formulated as an optimization problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We report encouraging results on the problem of compound-protein interaction network reconstruction from chemical structure data and genomic sequence data.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Mines ParisTech"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yoshihiro Yamanishi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamanishi:Yoshihiro"], "pages": 8}
