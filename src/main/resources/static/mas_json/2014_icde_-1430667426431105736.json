In this demo, we present iCoDA, a system that supports interactive, exploratory data completeness analysis. iCoDA provides algorithms and tools to generate tableau patterns that concisely summarize the incomplete data under various configuration settings. During the demo, the audience can use iCoDA to interactively explore the tableau patterns generated from incomplete data, with the flexibility of filtering and navigating through different granularity of these patterns. iCoDA supports various visualization methods to the audience for the display of tableau patterns. Overall, we will demonstrate that iCoDA provides sophisticated analysis of data completeness.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stevens Institute of Technology", "Stevens Institute of Technology", "Stevens Institute of Technology", "AT&T"], "authors": ["Ruilin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Ruilin", "Guan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Guan", "Wendy Hui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wendy_Hui", "Flip Korn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korn:Flip"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
