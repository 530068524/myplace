{"title": "Direct Density-Ratio Estimation with Dimensionality Reduction via Hetero-Distributional Subspace Analysis.", "fields": ["subspace topology", "estimator", "density ratio", "dimensionality reduction", "anomaly detection"], "abstract": "Methods for estimating the ratio of two probability density functions have been actively explored recently since they can be used for various data processing tasks such as non-stationarity adaptation, outlier detection, feature selection, and conditional probability estimation. In this paper, we propose a new density-ratio estimator which incorporates dimensionality reduction into the density-ratio estimation procedure. Through experiments, the proposed method is shown to compare favorably with existing density-ratio estimators in terms of both accuracy and computational costs.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Japan Science a ... hnology Agency"], "authors": ["Makoto Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada:Makoto", "Masashi Sugiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiyama:Masashi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
