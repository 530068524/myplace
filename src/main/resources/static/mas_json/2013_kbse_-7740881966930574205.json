Despite the success of symmetry reduction in mitigating state explosion problem, one essential step towards its soundness and effectiveness, i.e., how to discover sufficient symmetries with least human efforts, is often either overlooked or oversimplified. In this work, we show how a concurrent model can be viewed as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), and present an algorithm capable of detecting symmetries arising from the CSP which induce automorphisms of the model. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first approach that can automatically detect both process and data symmetries as demonstrated via a number of systems.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "National University of Singapore", "Nanyang Technological University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Shao Jie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shao_Jie", "Jun Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jun", "Chengnian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Chengnian", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Yang", "Junwei Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Junwei", "Jin Song Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Jin_Song"], "pages": 11}
