{"title": "Modular Parallelization Framework for Multi-Stream Video Processing.", "fields": ["software framework", "video tracking", "modular design", "video processing", "automatic parallelization"], "abstract": "A flow-based software framework specialized for 3D and video is presented, which in particular handles automatic parallelization of multi-stream video processing. The workflow is decomposed into a set of filter units which become nodes in a graph. Execution with support for time windows on node inputs is automatically handled by the framework, as well as low-level manipulation of multi-dimensional data.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles"], "authors": ["Tim Lenertz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lenertz:Tim", "Gauthier Lafruit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lafruit:Gauthier"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 5}
