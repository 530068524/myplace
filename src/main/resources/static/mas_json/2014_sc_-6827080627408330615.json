In the space of parallel genomic sequence search, most of the popular software packages, like mpiBLAST, use the database segmentation approach, wherein the entire database is sharded and searched on different nodes. However this approach does not scale well with the increasing length of individual query sequences as well as the rapid growth in size of sequence databases. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained parallelism technique, called Orion, that divides the input query into an adaptive number of fragments and shards the database. Our technique achieves higher parallelism (and hence speedup) and load balancing than database sharding alone, while maintaining 100% accuracy. We show that it is 12.3X faster than mpiBLAST for solving a relevant comparative genomics problem.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Kanak Mahadik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahadik:Kanak", "Somali Chaterji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaterji:Somali", "Bowen Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Bowen", "Milind Kulkarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulkarni_0001:Milind", "Saurabh Bagchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagchi:Saurabh"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
