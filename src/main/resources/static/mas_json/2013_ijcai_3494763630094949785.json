{"title": "Data Repair of Inconsistent DL-Programs.", "fields": ["logical consequence", "ontology", "description logic", "process ontology"], "abstract": "Nonmonotonic Description Logic (DL) programs support rule-based reasoning on top of Description Logic ontologies, using a well-defined query interface. However, the interaction of the rules and the ontology may cause inconsistency such that no answer set (i.e. model) exists. We thus consider repairing DL-programs, i.e., changing formulas to obtain consistency. Viewing the data part of the ontology as the source of inconsistency, we define program repairs and repair answer sets based on changes to it. We analyze the complexity of the notion, and we extend an algorithm for evaluating DL-programs to compute repair answer sets, under optional selection of preferred repairs. The extension involves a generalized ontology repair problem, in which the entailment and non-entailment of sets of queries with updates to the ontology must be achieved. While this is intractable in general, we identify for the Description Logic DL-LiteA some tractable classes of preferred repairs that are useful in practice.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Thomas Eiter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eiter:Thomas", "Michael Fink.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fink_0001:Michael", "Daria Stepanova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stepanova_0001:Daria"], "pages": 8}
