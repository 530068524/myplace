{"title": "Two Visual Strategies for Solving the Raven's Progressive Matrices Intelligence Test.", "fields": ["visual reasoning", "raven s progressive matrices", "mental image", "analogy", "g factor"], "abstract": "We present two visual algorithms, called the affine and fractal methods, which each solve a considerable portion of the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test. The RPM is considered to be one of the premier psychometric measures of general intelligence. Current computational accounts of the RPM assume that visual test inputs are translated into propositional representations before further reasoning takes place. We propose that visual strategies can also solve RPM problems, in line with behavioral evidence showing that humans do use visual strategies to some extent on the RPM. Our two visual methods currently solve RPM problems at the level of typical 9-to 10-year-olds.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Maithilee Kunda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kunda:Maithilee", "Keith McGreggor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McGreggor:Keith", "Ashok K.
