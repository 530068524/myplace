A wearable telemetry system captured video, audio, heart-rate and acceleration data, streaming them live to spectator interfaces and a watching audience. In this paper, we present a study of this event, which draws on video recordings and post-event interviews, and which highlights the experiences of riders, spectators and ride operators. Our study shows how the telemetry system transformed riders into performers, spectators into an audience, and how the role of ride operator began to include aspects of orchestration, with the relationship between all three roles also transformed. Critically, the introduction of a telemetry system seems to have had the potential to re-connect riders/performers back to operators/orchestrators and spectators/audience, re-introducing a closer relationship that used to be available with smaller rides. Introducing telemetry to a real-world situation also creates significant complexity, which we illustrate by focussing on a moment of perceived crisis.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "University of Nottingham", "Aerial, London, United Kingdom"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Holger Schn\u00e4delbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schn=auml=delbach:Holger", "Stefan Rennick Egglestone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egglestone:Stefan_Rennick", "Stuart Reeves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reeves:Stuart", "Steve Benford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benford:Steve", "Brendan Walker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walker:Brendan", "Michael Wright.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wright:Michael"], "pages": 10}
