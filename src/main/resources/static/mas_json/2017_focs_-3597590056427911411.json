As corollaries we obtain the same improvedbound on the thin-shell estimate, Poincar\\e constant and Lipschitzconcentration constant and an alternative proof of this bound forthe isotropic constant; it also follows that the ball walk for samplingfrom an isotropic logconcave density in \\R^{n} converges in O^{*}(n^{2.5})steps from a warm start.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yin Tat Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yin_Tat", "Santosh Srinivas Vempala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vempala:Santosh_Srinivas"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
