{"title": "Handling Open Knowledge for Service Robots.", "fields": ["open knowledge base connectivity", "test set", "service robot", "procedural knowledge", "domain knowledge"], "abstract": "Users may ask a service robot to accomplish various tasks so that the designer of the robot cannot program each of the tasks beforehand. As more and more open-source knowledge resources become available, it is worthwhile trying to make use of open-source knowledge resources for service robots. The challenge lies in the autonomous identification, acquisition and utilization of missing knowledge about a user task at hand. In this paper, the core problem is formalized and the complexity results of the main reasoning issues are provided. A mechanism for task planning with open-knowledge rules which are provided by non-experts in semi-structured natural language and thus generally underspecified are introduced. Techniques for translating the semi-structured knowledge from a large open-source knowledge base are also presented. Experiments showed a remarkable improvement of the system performance on a test set consisting of hundreds of user desires from the open-source knowledge base.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Xiaoping Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiaoping", "Jian-Min Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Jian=Min", "Zhiqiang Sui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sui:Zhiqiang", "Jiongkun Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Jiongkun"], "pages": 7}
