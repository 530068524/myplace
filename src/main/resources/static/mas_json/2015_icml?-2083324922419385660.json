{"title": "MRA-based Statistical Learning from Incomplete Rankings.", "fields": ["recommender system", "multiresolution analysis", "search engine", "inference", "ranking"], "abstract": "Statistical analysis of rank data describing preferences over small and variable subsets of a potentially large ensemble of items {1,..., n} is a very challenging problem. It is motivated by a wide variety of modern applications, such as recommender systems or search engines. However, very few inference methods have been documented in the literature to learn a ranking model from such incomplete rank data. The goal of this paper is twofold: it develops a rigorous mathematical framework for the problem of learning a ranking model from incomplete rankings and introduces a novel general statistical method to address it. Based on an original concept of multiresolution analysis (MRA) of incomplete rankings, it finely adapts to any observation setting, leading to a statistical accuracy and an algorithmic complexity that depend directly on the complexity of the observed data. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we also provide experimental results that show its statistical performance.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Eric Sibony.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sibony:Eric", "St\u00e9phan Cl\u00e9men\u00e7on.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cl=eacute=men=ccedil=on:St=eacute=phan", "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Jakubowicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jakubowicz:J=eacute=r=eacute=mie"], "pages": 10}
