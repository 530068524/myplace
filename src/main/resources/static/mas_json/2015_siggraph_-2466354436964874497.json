In order to study the organ, bone, or other object of interest, this data needs to be segmented to obtain a 3D model that can be used in any number of down stream applications. When used for treatment planning these segmentations need to not only be accurate but also produced quickly to avoid health risks. Automatic segmentation methods are becoming more reliable but many experts in the scientific community still rely on time consuming manual segmentation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Oregon State University"], "authors": ["Michelle Holloway.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holloway:Michelle", "Tao Ju.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ju:Tao", "Cindy Grimm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grimm:Cindy"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
