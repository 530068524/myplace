However, very few data mining researchers have a chance to see a working data mining system on real mobile communication data. In this demo, we showcase our new system MobileMiner on a real mobile communication data set, which presents a case study of business solutions using state-of-the-art data mining techniques. MobileMiner adaptively profiles users' behavior from their calling and moving record streams. Customer segmentation and social community analysis can be conducted based on user profiles. We show how data mining techniques can help in mobile communication data analysis. Moreover, we also show some interesting observations which still cannot be mined by the current techniques, and thus may motivate new research and development.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Tengjiao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Tengjiao", "Bishan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Bishan", "Jun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jun", "Dongqing Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Dongqing", "Shiwei Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shiwei", "Haoyu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Haoyu", "Kedong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Kedong", "Jian Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Jian"], "pages": 4}
