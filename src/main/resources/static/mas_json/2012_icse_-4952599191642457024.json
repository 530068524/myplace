Of particular importance are parametric monitoring systems, which allow the specification of properties that relate objects in a program, rather than only global properties. In the past decade, a number of parametric runtime monitoring systems have been developed. Here we give a demonstration of our system, JavaMOP. It is the only parametric monitoring system that allows multiple differing logical formalisms. It is also the most efficient in terms of runtime overhead, and very competitive with respect to memory usage.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Dongyun Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Dongyun", "Patrick O'Neil Meredith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meredith:Patrick_O=Neil", "Choonghwan Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Choonghwan", "Grigore Rosu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosu:Grigore"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
