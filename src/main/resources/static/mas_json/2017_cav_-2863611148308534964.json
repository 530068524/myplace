{"title": "DryVR: Data-Driven Verification and Compositional Reasoning for Automotive Systems.", "fields": ["automotive industry", "bounded function", "randomized algorithm", "powertrain", "reachability"], "abstract": "We present the DryVR framework for verifying hybrid control systems that are described by a combination of a black-box simulator for trajectories and a white-box transition graph specifying mode switches. The framework includes (a) a probabilistic algorithm for learning sensitivity of the continuous trajectories from simulation data, (b) a bounded reachability analysis algorithm that uses the learned sensitivity, and (c) reasoning techniques based on simulation relations and sequential composition, that enable verification of complex systems under long switching sequences, from the reachability analysis of a simpler system under shorter sequences. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by verifying a suite of automotive benchmarks that include powertrain control, automatic transmission, and several autonomous and ADAS features like automatic emergency braking, lane-merge, and auto-passing controllers.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Chuchu Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Chuchu", "Bolun Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Bolun", "Sayan Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Sayan", "Mahesh Viswanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viswanathan_0001:Mahesh"], "pages": 21}
