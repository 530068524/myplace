The presence of clutter is a major problem for existing single-view 3D reconstruction algorithms, most of which rely on finding the ground-wall boundary. In most rooms, this boundary is partially or entirely occluded. We gain robustness to clutter by modeling the global room space with a parameteric 3D \u201cbox\u201d and by iteratively localizing clutter and refitting the box. To fit the box, we introduce a structured learning algorithm that chooses the set of parameters to minimize error, based on global perspective cues. On a dataset of 308 images, we demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to recover spatial layout in cluttered rooms and show several examples of estimated free space.", "citation": "Citations (377)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Varsha Hedau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hedau:Varsha", "Derek Hoiem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoiem:Derek", "David A.
