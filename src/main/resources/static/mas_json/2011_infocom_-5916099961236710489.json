However, traditional disk sensing model does not consider this intrinsic property of camera sensors. To this end, we propose a novel model called full-view coverage. An object is considered to be full-view covered if for any direction from 0 to 2\u03c0 (object's facing direction), there is always a sensor such that the object is within the sensor's range and more importantly the sensor's viewing direction is sufficiently close to the object's facing direction. With this model, we propose an efficient method for full-view coverage detection in any given camera sensor networks. We also derive a sufficient condition on the sensor density needed for full-view coverage in a random uniform deployment. Finally, we show a necessary and sufficient condition on the sensor density for full-view coverage in a triangular lattice based deployment.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Yi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0014:Yi", "Guohong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Guohong"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
