{"title": "Early detection of migraine attacks based on wearable sensors: experiences of data collection using Empatica E4.", "fields": ["migraine", "wearable computer", "data collection", "activity based costing", "usability"], "abstract": "The migraine is a chronic, incapacitating neurovascular disorder, characterized by attacks of severe headache and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, concerning 15% of people in developed countries. It is one of the most understated and incapacitating diseases in the world and costing yearly 111 Billion Euros in Europe only. In our study, we discarded the mechanisms affecting to the migraine but instead the focus was on early detection of the attacks by using human measured biosignals. By using a single, easy and comfortable wearable sensor device the aim was to develop a model that assists individuals to take their medication on time and hence help to avoid the pain in migraine. In this paper, a preliminary study concept is presented as well as the experiences of the data collection using Empatica E4 device is carried out. The experiences are introduced from the point of view of the researchers themselves but also the volunteers actually using the device answered to a short survey about the usability issues as well as gave opinions of the future migraine detection device itself.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "authors": ["Heli Koskim\u00e4ki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koskim=auml=ki:Heli", "Henna M\u00f6nttinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=ouml=nttinen:Henna", "Pekka Siirtola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siirtola:Pekka", "Hanna-Leena Huttunen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huttunen:Hanna=Leena", "Raija Halonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halonen:Raija", "Juha R\u00f6ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=ouml=ning:Juha"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
