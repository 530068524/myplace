{"title": "Why Big Data Industrial Systems Need Rules and What We Can Do About It.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "database", "data mining", "big data", "information extraction"], "abstract": "Big Data industrial systems that address problems such as classification, information extraction, and entity matching very commonly use hand-crafted rules. Today, however, little is understood about the usage of such rules. In this paper we explore this issue. We discuss how these systems differ from those considered in academia. We describe default solutions, their limitations, and reasons for using rules. We show examples of extensive rule usage in industry. Contrary to popular perceptions, we show that there is a rich set of research challenges in rule generation, evaluation, execution, optimization, and maintenance. We discuss ongoing work at WalmartLabs and UW-Madison that illustrate these challenges. Our main conclusions are (1) using rules (together with techniques such as learning and crowdsourcing) is fundamental to building semantics-intensive Big Data systems, and (2) it is increasingly critical to address rule management, given the tens of thousands of rules industrial systems often manage today in an ad-hoc fashion.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "LinkedIn", "Uber, San Francisco, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Paul Suganthan G.
