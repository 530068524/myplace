The actual energy expenditure is unpractical to measure; hence, the field aims at estimating it by measuring the physical activity with accelerometers and other sensors. Current advanced estimators use a context-dependent approach in which a different regression model is invoked for different activities of the user. In this paper, we go a step further and use multiple contexts corresponding to multiple sensors, resulting in an ensemble of models for energy expenditure estimation. This provides a multi-view perspective, which leads to a better estimation of the energy. The proposed method was experimentally evaluated on a comprehensive set of activities where it outperformed the current state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Ljubljana", "Jozef Stefan In ... ljana, Slovenia", "Jozef Stefan In ... ljana, Slovenia", "Jozef Stefan In ... ljana, Slovenia", "Jozef Stefan In ... ljana, Slovenia"], "authors": ["Hristijan Gjoreski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gjoreski:Hristijan", "Bostjan Kaluza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaluza:Bostjan", "Matjaz Gams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gams:Matjaz", "Radoje Milic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milic:Radoje", "Mitja Lustrek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lustrek:Mitja"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
