{"title": "Outlier-Robust Convex Segmentation.", "fields": ["regular polygon", "speech segmentation", "market segmentation", "scale space segmentation", "outlier"], "abstract": "We derive a convex optimization problem for the task of segmenting sequential data, which explicitly treats presence of outliers. We describe two algorithms for solving this problem, one exact and one a top-down novel approach, and we derive a consistency results for the case of two segments and no outliers. Robustness to outliers is evaluated on two real-world tasks related to speech segmentation. Our algorithms outperform baseline segmentation algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Itamar Katz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katz:Itamar", "Koby Crammer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crammer:Koby"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
