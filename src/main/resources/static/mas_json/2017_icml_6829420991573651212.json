This includes indicators of balls and ellipses; non-linear functions which are radial with respect to the $L_1$ norm; and smooth non-linear functions. We also show that these gaps can be observed experimentally: Increasing the depth indeed allows better learning than increasing width, when training neural networks to learn an indicator of a unit ball.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Itay Safran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Safran:Itay", "Ohad Shamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamir:Ohad"], "pages": 9}
