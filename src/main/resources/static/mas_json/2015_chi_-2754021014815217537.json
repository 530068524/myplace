{"title": "Polymorphic Blocks: Formalism-Inspired UI for Structured Connectors.", "fields": ["scratch", "formalism", "mathematical proof", "programming language", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We present a novel block-based UI called Polymorphic Blocks, in which a connector's shape visually represents the structure of the data being passed through the connector. We use Polymorphic Blocks to add visual type information to block-based programming environments like Blockly or Scratch. We also use Polymorphic Blocks to represent logical proofs. In this context, if we erase all symbols, our UI becomes a puzzle game, where solving the puzzle amounts to building a proof. We show through a user study that our Logical Puzzle Game is faster, more fun, and more engaging than an equivalent pen-and-paper interface.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sorin Lerner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerner:Sorin", "Stephen R.
