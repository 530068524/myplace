Moreover, if F can be computed in complexity class C, then under mild assumptions, this \"delta-decision problem\" for bounded Sigma_k-sentences resides in Sigma_k(C). The results stand in sharp contrast to the well-known undecidability of the general first-order theories with these functions, and serve as a theoretical basis for the use of numerical methods in decision procedures for formulas over the reals.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Sicun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Sicun", "Jeremy Avigad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avigad:Jeremy", "Edmund M.
