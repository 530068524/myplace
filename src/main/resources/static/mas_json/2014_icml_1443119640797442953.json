{"title": "Finito: A faster, permutable incremental gradient method for big data problems.", "fields": ["convex function", "black box", "permutable prime", "big data", "simple random sample"], "abstract": "Recent advances in optimization theory have shown that smooth strongly convex finite sums can be minimized faster than by treating them as a black box \"batch\" problem. In this work we introduce a new method in this class with a theoretical convergence rate four times faster than existing methods, for sums with sufficiently many terms. This method is also amendable to a sampling without replacement scheme that in practice gives further speed-ups. We give empirical results showing state of the art performance.", "citation": "Citations (102)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Aaron Defazio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Defazio:Aaron", "Justin Domke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Domke:Justin", "Tib\u00e9rio S.
