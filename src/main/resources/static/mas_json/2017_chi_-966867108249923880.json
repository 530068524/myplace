{"title": "Understanding Volunteer AT Fabricators: Opportunities and Challenges in DIY-AT for Others in e-NABLE.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "end user", "design and technology", "computer science", "volunteer"], "abstract": "We present the results of a study of e-NABLE, a distributed, collaborative volunteer effort to design and fabricate upper-limb assistive technology devices for limb-different users. Informed by interviews with 14 stakeholders in e-NABLE, including volunteers and clinicians, we discuss differences and synergies among each group with respect to motivations, skills, and perceptions of risks inherent in the project. We found that both groups are motivated to be involved in e-NABLE by the ability to use their skills to help others, and that their skill sets are complementary, but that their different perceptions of risk may result in uneven outcomes or missed expectations for end users. We offer four opportunities for design and technology to enhance the stakeholders' abilities to work together.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Rochester Institute of Technology", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Rochester Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jeremiah Parry-Hill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parry=Hill:Jeremiah", "Patrick C.
