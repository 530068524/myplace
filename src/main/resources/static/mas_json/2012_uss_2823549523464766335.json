Central to these systems is the language used to express policies. Ideally, this language should be powerful, implementation-agnostic, and cross-platform. Unfortunately, today's popular intrusion detection systems fall short of this goal. Each has their own policy language in which expressing complicated logic requires implementation-specific code. Database systems have adapted SQL to handle streaming data, but have yet to achieve the efficiency and flexibility required for complex intrusion detection tasks.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce Chimera, a declarative query language for network traffic processing that bridges the gap between powerful intrusion detection systems and a simple, platform-independent SQL syntax. Chimera extends streaming SQL languages to better handle network traffic by adding structured data types, first-class functions, and dynamic window boundaries. We show how these constructs can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as side-jacking detection and DNS feature extraction. Finally, we describe the implementation and evaluation of a compiler that translates Chimera queries into low-level code for the Bro event language.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["National Security Agency", "National Security Agency", "Reservoir Labs"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Kevin Borders.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borders:Kevin", "Jonathan Springer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Springer:Jonathan", "Matthew Burnside.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burnside:Matthew"], "pages": 15}
