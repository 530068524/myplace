We present a novel method that leverages data from 'Wikispeedia', an online game played on Wikipedia; players have to reach an article from another, unrelated article, only by clicking links in the articles encountered. In order to automatically infer semantic distances between everyday concepts, our method effectively extracts the common sense displayed by humans during play, and is thus more desirable, from a cognitive point of view, than purely corpus-based methods. We show that our method significantly outperforms Latent Semantic Analysis in a psychometric evaluation of the quality of learned semantic distances.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["McGill University", "McGill University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Robert West.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/West_0001:Robert", "Joelle Pineau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pineau:Joelle", "Doina Precup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Precup:Doina"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
