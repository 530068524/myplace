{"title": "Who Composes the Music?: Musicality Evaluation for Algorithmic Composition via Electroencephalography.", "fields": ["musicality", "music theory", "algorithmic composition", "creative work", "creativity"], "abstract": "It is very challenging to evaluate the creative work of artificial intelligence, such as algorithmic composition. Due to the nature of creativity, most existing criteria of music analysis, for example, similarity of the data, cannot be used directly to measure the quality of a new piece of music composed by computer. Subjective evaluation based on questionnaire lacks quantitative evaluation with solid evidence. To address these difficulties, this paper proposes a novel computational model combined with a novel psychological paradigm. Utilizing brain imaging techniques, the proposed evaluation method can provide reliable musicality score for machine-composed music.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "authors": ["Gong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Gong"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
