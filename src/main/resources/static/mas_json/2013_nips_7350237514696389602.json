We show that the continuous time limit of the expectation propagation algorithm exists and results in a hybrid fixed point iteration consisting of (1) expectation propagation updates for discrete time terms and (2) variational updates for the continuous time term. We introduce post-inference corrections methods that improve on the marginals of the approximation. This approach extends the classical Kalman-Bucy smoothing procedure to non-Gaussian observations, enabling continuous-time inference in a variety of models, including spiking neuronal models (state-space models with point process observations) and box likelihood models. Experimental results on real and simulated data demonstrate high distributional accuracy and significant computational savings compared to discrete-time approaches in a neural application.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Technical University of Berlin", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Botond Cseke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cseke:Botond", "Manfred Opper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Opper:Manfred", "Guido Sanguinetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanguinetti:Guido"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
