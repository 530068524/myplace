Existing domain adaptation methods usually transfer sentiment knowledge from only one source domain to target domain. In this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation approach which can exploit sentiment knowledge from multiple source domains. We first extract both global and domain-specific sentiment knowledge from the data of multiple source domains using multi-task learning. Then we transfer them to target domain with the help of words\u2019 sentiment polarity relations extracted from the unlabeled target domain data. The similarities between target domain and different source domains are also incorporated into the adaptation process. Experimental results on benchmark dataset show the effectiveness of our approach in improving cross-domain sentiment classification performance.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tsinghua University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Fangzhao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Fangzhao", "Yongfeng Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Yongfeng"], "pages": -1}
