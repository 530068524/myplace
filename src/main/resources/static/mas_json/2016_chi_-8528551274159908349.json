However, the range of possible functions and options for translating vision into sound is largely open-ended. To provide constraints on the design of this technology, we interviewed ten BVIPs who were briefly trained in the use of three novel devices that, collectively, showcase a large range of design permutations. The SSDs include the 'Depth-vOICe,' 'Synaestheatre' and 'Creole' that offer high spatial, temporal, and colour resolutions respectively via a variety of sound outputs (electronic tones, instruments, vocals). The participants identified a range of practical concerns in relation to the devices (e.g. curb detection, recognition, mental effort) but also highlighted experiential aspects. This included both curiosity about the visual world (e.g. understanding shades of colour, the shape of cars, seeing the night sky) and the desire for the substituting sound to be responsive to movement of the device and aesthetically engaging.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Sussex", "University of Sussex", "University of Sussex", "University of Sussex", "Laboratory for  ... isbon, Portugal"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Giles Hamilton-Fletcher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamilton=Fletcher:Giles", "Marianna Obrist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Obrist:Marianna", "Phil L.
