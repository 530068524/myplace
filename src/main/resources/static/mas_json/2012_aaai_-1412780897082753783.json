Specifically, we learn a prediction function on the labeled source data while mapping the target data points to similar source data points by matching the target kernel matrix to a submatrix of the source kernel matrix based on a Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion. We formulate this simultaneous learning and mapping process as a non-convex integer optimization problem and present a local minimization procedure for its relaxed continuous form. Our empirical results show the proposed kernel matching method significantly outperforms alternative methods on the task of across domain sentiment classification.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Temple University", "Temple University"], "authors": ["Min Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Min", "Yuhong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yuhong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
