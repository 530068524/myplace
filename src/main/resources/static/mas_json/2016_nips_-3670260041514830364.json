{"title": "Online Convex Optimization with Unconstrained Domains and Losses.", "fields": ["upper and lower bounds", "hyperparameter optimization", "convex optimization", "regret", "exponential function"], "abstract": "We propose an online convex optimization algorithm (RescaledExp) that achieves optimal regret in the unconstrained setting without prior knowledge of any bounds on the loss functions. We prove a lower bound showing an exponential separation between the regret of existing algorithms that require a known bound on the loss functions and any algorithm that does not require such knowledge. RescaledExp matches this lower bound asymptotically in the number of iterations. RescaledExp is naturally hyperparameter-free and we demonstrate empirically that it matches prior optimization algorithms that require hyperparameter optimization.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Baylor College of Medicine", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Ashok Cutkosky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cutkosky:Ashok", "Kwabena A.
