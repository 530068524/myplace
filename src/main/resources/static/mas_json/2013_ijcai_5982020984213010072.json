Constraint solvers are implemented in CHR as a set of high-level rules that specify the simplification (rewriting) and constraint propagation behavior. The traditional CHR execution algorithm manipulates a global store representing a flat conjunction of constraints. This paper introduces SMCHR: a tight integration of CHR with a modern Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver. Unlike CHR, SMCHR can handle (quantifier-free) formulae with an arbitrary propositional structure. SMCHR is essentially a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver where the theory T is implemented in CHR.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Gregory James Duck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duck:Gregory_James"], "pages": 5}
