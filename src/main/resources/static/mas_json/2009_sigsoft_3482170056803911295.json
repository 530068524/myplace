{"title": "Improving slice accuracy by compression of data and control flow paths.", "fields": ["slicing", "empirical research", "program slicing", "control flow", "compression"], "abstract": "Program slicing is a useful technique in tools for program understanding and transformation. Computing correct and accurate slices for unstructured programs is particularly difficult. We present a new family of slicing algorithms that are proved correct and are more accurate than the best previous algorithms. An empirical study shows significant improvements of our algorithms on real code.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Aharon Abadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abadi:Aharon", "Ran Ettinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ettinger:Ran", "Yishai A.
