Other literature recognizes lying as an everyday phenomenon that preserves such relationship boundaries by facilitating smooth social interactions. Combining these strands of research, one might hypothesize that people with a predisposition to lie would generally have lower privacy concerns since lying is a means to preserve relationship boundaries. We tested this hypothesis using structural equation modeling on data from a survey administered nationwide (N=1532), and found that for location-sharing, people with a high propensity to lie actually have increased boundary preservation concerns as well as increased privacy concerns. We explain these findings using results from semi-structured interviews.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Xinru Page.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Page:Xinru", "Bart P.
