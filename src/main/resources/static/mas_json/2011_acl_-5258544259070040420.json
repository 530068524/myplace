Given a misspelled word, the system finds words in a dictionary, which are most \"similar\" to the misspelled word. The paper proposes a probabilistic approach to the task, which is both accurate and efficient. The approach includes the use of a log linear model, a method for training the model, and an algorithm for finding the top k candidates. The log linear model is defined as a conditional probability distribution of a corrected word and a rule set for the correction conditioned on the misspelled word. The learning method employs the criterion in candidate generation as loss function. The retrieval algorithm is efficient and is guaranteed to find the optimal k candidates. Experimental results on large scale data show that the proposed approach improves upon existing methods in terms of accuracy in different settings.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Peking University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Peking University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ziqi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ziqi", "Gu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Gu", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Hang", "Ming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Ming"], "pages": 10}
