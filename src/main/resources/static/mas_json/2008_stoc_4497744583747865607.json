In other words, the image of f is not contained in the image of any polynomial-mapping \u0393:C m-1  \u2192 C m  of degree~1 (that is, an affine mapping). Can one give an explicit example for a polynomial curve f:C \u2192 C m , such that, the image of f is not contained in the image of any polynomial-mapping \u0393:C m-1  \u2192 C m  of degree 2? In this paper, we show that problems of this type are closely related to proving lower bounds for the size of general arithmetic circuits. For example, any explicit f as above (with the right notion of explicitness implies super-polynomial lower bounds for computing the permanent over~C. More generally, we say that a polynomial-mapping f:F n  \u2192 F m  is  (s,r)-elusive , if for every polynomial-mapping \u0393:F s  \u2192 F m  of degree r, Im(f) \u2284 Im(\u0393). We show that for many settings of the parameters n,m,s,r, explicit constructions of elusive polynomial-mappings imply strong (up to exponential) lower bounds for general arithmetic circuits. Finally, for every r  n  \u2192 F n 2  , of degree O(r), that is (s,r)-elusive for s = n 1+\u03a9(1/r) . We use this to construct for any r, an explicit example for an n-variate polynomial of total-degree O(r), with coefficients in {0,1,}such that, any depth r arithmetic circuit for this polynomial (over any field) is of size \u2265 n 1+\u03a9(1/r) . In particular, for any constant r, this gives a constant degree polynomial, such that, any depth r arithmetic circuit for this polynomial is of size \u2265 n 1+\u03a9(1) . Previously, only lower bounds of the type \u03a9(n \u2022 \u03bb r  (n)), where \u03bb r  (n) are extremely slowly growing functions (e.g., \u03bb 5 (n) = log n, and \u03bb 7 (n) = log* log*n), were known for constant-depth arithmetic circuits for polynomials of constant degree.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ran Raz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raz:Ran"], "pages": 10}
