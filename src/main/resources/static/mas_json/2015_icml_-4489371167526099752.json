{"title": "Geometric Conditions for Subspace-Sparse Recovery.", "fields": ["cluster analysis", "sparse approximation", "subspace topology", "linear independence", "combinatorics"], "abstract": "Given a dictionary \u03a0 and a signal \u03be = \u03a0x generated by a few linearly independent columns of \u03a0, classical sparse recovery theory deals with the problem of uniquely recovering the sparse representation x of \u03be. In this work, we consider the more general case where \u03be lies in a low-dimensional subspace spanned by a few columns of \u03a0, which are possibly linearly dependent. In this case, x may not unique, and the goal is to recover any subset of the columns of \u03a0 that spans the subspace containing \u03be. We call such a representation x subspace-sparse. We study conditions under which existing pursuit methods recover a subspace-sparse representation. Such conditions reveal important geometric insights and have implications for the theory of classical sparse recovery as well as subspace clustering.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Chong You.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/You:Chong", "Ren\u00e9 Vidal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidal:Ren=eacute="], "pages": 9}
