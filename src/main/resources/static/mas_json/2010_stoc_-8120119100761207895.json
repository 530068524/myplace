{"title": "Towards polynomial lower bounds for dynamic problems.", "fields": ["3sum", "dynamic problem", "conjecture", "modular design", "graph"], "abstract": "We consider a number of dynamic problems with no known poly-logarithmic upper bounds, and show that they require n \u03a9 (1) time per operation, unless 3SUM has strongly subquadratic algorithms. Our result is modular: (1) We describe a carefully-chosen dynamic version of set disjointness (the \"multiphase problem\"), and conjecture that it requires n^Omega(1) time per operation. All our lower bounds follow by easy reduction. (2) We reduce 3SUM to the multiphase problem. Ours is the first nonalgebraic reduction from 3SUM, and allows 3SUM-hardness results for combinatorial problems. For instance, it implies hardness of reporting all triangles in a graph. (3) It is plausible that an unconditional lower bound for the multiphase problem can be established via a number-on-forehead communication game.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["AT&T Labs"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Mihai Patrascu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patrascu:Mihai"], "pages": 8}
