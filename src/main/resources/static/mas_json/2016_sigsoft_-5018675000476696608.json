{"title": "Lightweight specification and analysis of dynamic systems with rich configurations.", "fields": ["software design", "operator", "language of temporal ordering specification", "correctness", "software development process"], "abstract": "Model-checking is increasingly popular in the early phases of the software development process. To establish the correctness of a software design one must usually verify both  structural  and  behavioral  (or temporal) properties. Unfortunately, most specification languages, and accompanying model-checkers, excel only in analyzing either one or the other kind. This limits their ability to verify dynamic systems with rich  configurations : systems whose state space is characterized by rich structural properties, but whose evolution is also expected to satisfy certain temporal properties.   To address this problem, we first propose Electrum, an extension of the Alloy specification language with temporal logic operators, where both rich configurations and expressive temporal properties can easily be defined. Two alternative model-checking techniques are then proposed, one bounded and the other unbounded, to verify systems expressed in this language, namely to verify that every desirable temporal property holds for every possible configuration.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Minho", "University of Toulouse", "University of Toulouse", "University of Minho", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Nuno Macedo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Macedo:Nuno", "Julien Brunel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brunel:Julien", "David Chemouil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chemouil:David", "Alcino Cunha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cunha:Alcino", "Denis Kuperberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuperberg:Denis"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2016", "pages": 11}
