{"title": "ReConMUC: adaptable consistency requirements for efficient large-scale multi-user chat.", "fields": ["scalability", "bounded function", "consistency model", "cpu time", "multi user"], "abstract": "Multi-user chat (MUC) applications raise serious challenges to developers concerning scalability and efficient use of network bandwidth, due to a large number of users exchanging lots of messages in real-time. We propose a new approach to MUC message propagation based on an adaptable consistency model bounded by three metrics: Filter, Time and Volume. In this model, the server propagates some messages as soon as possible while others are postponed until certain conditions are met, according to each client consistency requirements. These requirements can change during the session lifetime, constantly adapting to each client's current context.   We developed a prototype called ReConMUC (Relaxed Consistency MUC) as an extension to a well-known MUC protocol, which, by attaching a special component to the server, filters messages before they are broadcast, according to client consistency requirements.   The performance results obtained show that ReConMUC effectively reduces the server outbound bandwidth, without significant increase in memory and CPU usage, thus improving scalability.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Technical University of Lisbon", "Technical University of Lisbon"], "authors": ["Pedro Alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alves:Pedro", "Paulo Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira_0001:Paulo"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
