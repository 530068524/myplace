Our method works by taking a Bayesian approach to partition a stream of data into postulated task-specific segments, while simultaneously building a model for each task. We provide regret guarantees with respect to piecewise stationary data sources under the logarithmic loss, and validate the method empirically across a range of sequence prediction and task identification problems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Kieran Milan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milan:Kieran", "Joel Veness.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veness:Joel", "James Kirkpatrick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirkpatrick:James", "Michael H.
