{"title": "Improving the performance of motor-impaired users with automatically-generated, ability-based interfaces.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "preference elicitation", "multimedia", "user interface", "software"], "abstract": "We evaluate two systems for automatically generating personalized interfaces adapted to the individual motor capabilities of users with motor impairments. The first system, SUPPLE, adapts to users' capabilities indirectly by first using the ARNAULD preference elicitation engine to model a user's preferences regarding how he or she likes the interfaces to be created. The second system, SUPPLE++, models a user's motor abilities directly from a set of one-time motor performance tests. In a study comparing these approaches to baseline interfaces, participants with motor impairments were 26.4% faster using ability-based user interfaces generated by SUPPLE++. They also made 73% fewer errors, strongly preferred those interfaces to the manufacturers' defaults, and found them more efficient, easier to use, and much less physically tiring. These findings indicate that rather than requiring some users with motor impairments to adapt themselves to software using separate assistive technologies, software can now adapt itself to the capabilities of its users.", "citation": "Citations (180)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Krzysztof Z.
