Most existing popular text mining and classification methods have adopted term-based approaches. However, they have all suffered from the problems of polysemy and synonymy. Over the years, people have often held the hypothesis that pattern-based methods should perform better than term-based ones in describing user preferences, but many experiments do not support this hypothesis. The innovative technique presented in paper makes a breakthrough for this difficulty. This technique discovers both positive and negative patterns in text documents as higher level features in order to accurately weight low-level features (terms) based on their specificity and their distributions in the higher level features. Substantial experiments using this technique on Reuters Corpus Volume 1 and TREC topics show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms both the state-of-the-art term-based methods underpinned by Okapi BM25, Rocchio or Support Vector Machine and pattern based methods on precision, recall and F measures.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["Queensland University of Technology", "Queensland University of Technology", "Maebashi Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yuefeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuefeng", "Abdulmohsen Algarni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Algarni:Abdulmohsen", "Ning Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong_0001:Ning"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
