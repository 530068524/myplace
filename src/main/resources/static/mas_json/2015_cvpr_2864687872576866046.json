In this paper, we study the problem of cross-view retrieval and propose an effective Semantics-Preserving Hashing method, termed SePH. Given semantic affinities of training data as supervised information, SePH transforms them into a probability distribution and approximates it with to-be-learnt hash codes in Hamming space via minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Then kernel logistic regression with a sampling strategy is utilized to learn the nonlinear projections from features in each view to the learnt hash codes. And for any unseen instance, predicted hash codes and their corresponding output probabilities from observed views are utilized to determine its unified hash code, using a novel probabilistic approach. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness and reasonableness of SePH.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Zijia Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zijia", "Guiguang Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Guiguang", "Mingqing Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Mingqing", "Jianmin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Jianmin"], "pages": 9}
