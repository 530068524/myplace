Research on values in social computing is challenged by disagreement about indicators and objects of study as researchers distribute their focus across contexts of technology design, adoption, and use. This paper draws upon a framework that clarifies how to see values in social computing research by describing values dimensions, comprised of sources and attributes of values in sociotechnical systems. This paper uses the framework to compare how diverse research methods employed in social computing surface values and make them visible to researchers. The framework provides a tool to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method for observing values dimensions. By detailing how and where researchers might observe interactions between values and technology design and use, we hope to enable researchers to systematically identify and investigate values in social computing.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Katie Shilton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shilton:Katie", "Jes A.
