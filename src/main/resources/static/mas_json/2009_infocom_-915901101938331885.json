{"title": "Load Balancing for SIP Server Clusters.", "fields": ["load management", "web server", "server", "session initiation protocol", "database transaction"], "abstract": "This paper introduces several novel load balancing algorithms for distributing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requests to a cluster of SIP servers. Our load balancer improves both throughput and response time versus a single node, while exposing a single interface to external clients. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of our system using a cluster of Intel x86 machines running Linux. We compare our algorithms with several well-known approaches and present scalability results for up to 10 nodes. Our best algorithm, Transaction Least-Work-Left (TLWL), achieves its performance by integrating several features: knowledge of the SIP proto- col; dynamic estimates of back-end server load; distinguishing transactions from calls; recognizing variability in call length; and exploiting differences in processing costs for different SIP transactions. By combining these features, our algorithm provides finer-grained load balancing than standard approaches, resulting in throughput improvements of up to 24 percent and response time improvements of up to two orders of magnitude. We present a detailed analysis of occupancy to show how our algorithms significantly reduce response time.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Hongbo Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Hongbo", "Arun Iyengar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iyengar:Arun", "Erich M.
