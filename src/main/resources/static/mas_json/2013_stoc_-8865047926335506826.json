Previously this was only known under quantum reductions.   Our techniques capture the tradeoff between the dimension and the modulus of LWE instances, leading to a much better understanding of the landscape of the problem. The proof is inspired by techniques from several recent cryptographic constructions, most notably fully homomorphic encryption schemes.", "citation": "Citations (321)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Stanford University", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "New York University", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Zvika Brakerski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brakerski:Zvika", "Adeline Langlois.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langlois:Adeline", "Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris", "Oded Regev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regev_0001:Oded", "Damien Stehl\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stehl=eacute=:Damien"], "pages": 10}
