Here, we examine some of the common cultural ideals non-experts constructed of a \"new\" pornographic experience - Virtual Reality (VR) Porn - through use of the \"Story Completion Method\". Forty five participants completed a story stem about a male character who was about to have his \"very first virtual reality porn experience\". Through our analysis, we demonstrate a narrative of a \"perfect\", idealised sexual experience, as well as one which emphasised the imagined \"precarious\" and dangerous consequences around this technology use. We indicate how the stories reproduced ideals around heteronormativity and hegemonic masculinity, suggesting an agenda of \"Designing for Eroticism\" as a tactic which could avoid such problematic discourses. We also suggest the opportunities and challenges presented through use of the \"Story Completion Method\".", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Newcastle University", "Northumbria University", "Newcastle University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Matthew Wood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wood:Matthew", "Gavin Wood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wood:Gavin", "Madeline Balaam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balaam:Madeline"], "pages": 13}
