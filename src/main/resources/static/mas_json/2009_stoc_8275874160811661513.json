Given a weighted undirected n-vertex graph G=(V,E) and an integer k \u2265 1, the subgraph H=(V,E'), E'\u2286 E, is a  spanner  of stretch k (or, a k-spanner) of G if \u03b4 H (u,v) \u2264 k\u00b7 \u03b4 G (u,v) for every u,v \u2208 V, where \u03b4 G' (u,v) denotes the distance between u and v in G'. Graph spanners were extensively studied since their introduction over two decades ago. It is known how to efficiently construct a (2k-1)-spanner of size O(n 1+1/k ), and this size-stretch tradeoff is conjectured to be tight. The notion of  fault tolerant  spanners was introduced a decade ago in the geometric setting [Levcopoulos et al., STOC'98]. A subgraph H is an f-vertex fault tolerant k-spanner of the graph G if for any set F\u2286 V of size at most f and any pair of vertices u,v \u2208 V \\ F, the distances in H satisfy \u03b4 H \\ F (u,v) \u2264 k\u00b7 \u03b4 G \\ F (u,v). Levcopoulos et al. presented an efficient algorithm that given a set S of n points in R d , constructs an f-vertex fault tolerant  geometric  (1+e)-spanner for S, that is, a sparse graph H such that for every set F\u2286 S of size f and any pair of points u,v \u2208 S \\ F, \u03b4 H \\ F (u,v) \u2264 (1+e) |uv|, where |uv| is the Euclidean distance between u and v. A fault tolerant geometric spanner with optimal maximum degree and total weight was presented in [Czumaj &#; Zhao, SoCG'03]. This paper also raised as an open problem the question whether it is possible to obtain a fault tolerant spanner for an arbitrary undirected weighted graph. The current paper answers this question in the affirmative, presenting an f-vertex fault tolerant (2k-1)-spanner of size O(f 2  k f+1  \u00b7 n 1+1/k log 1-1/k n). Interestingly, the stretch of the spanner remains unchanged while the size of the spanner only increases by a factor that depends on the stretch k, on the number of potential faults f, and on logarithmic terms in n. In addition, we consider the simpler setting of f- edge  fault tolerant spanners (defined analogously). We present an f-edge fault tolerant 2k-1 spanner with edge set of size O(f\u00b7 n 1+1/k ) (only f times larger than standard spanners). For both edge and vertex faults, our results are shown to hold when the given graph G is weighted.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Open University of Israel", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Bar-Ilan University", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "mikel@openu.ac.il", "liamr@macs.biu.ac.il"], "authors": ["Shiri Chechik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechik:Shiri", "Michael Langberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Langberg:Michael", "David Peleg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peleg:David", "Liam Roditty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roditty:Liam"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
