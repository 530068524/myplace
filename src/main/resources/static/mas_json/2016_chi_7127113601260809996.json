{"title": "The Hybrid Bricolage: Bridging Parametric Design with Craft through Algorithmic Modularity.", "fields": ["parametric design", "bridging", "bricolage", "modularity", "bounded function"], "abstract": "The digital design space, unlimited by its virtual freedom, differs from traditional craft, which is bounded by a fixed set of given materials. We study how to introduce parametric design tools to craftspersons. Our hypothesis is that the arrangement of parametric design in modular representation, in the form of a catalog, can assist makers unfamiliar with this practice. We evaluate this assumption in the realm of bag design, through a Honeycomb Smocking Pattern Catalog and custom Computer-Aided Smocking (CAS) design software. We describe the technical work and designs made with our tools, present a user study that validates our assumptions, and conclude with ideas for future work developing additional tools to bridge computational design and craft.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Bezalel Academy ... rusalem, Israel"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tamara Anna Efrat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Efrat:Tamara_Anna", "Moran Mizrahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mizrahi:Moran", "Amit Zoran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zoran:Amit"], "pages": 12}
