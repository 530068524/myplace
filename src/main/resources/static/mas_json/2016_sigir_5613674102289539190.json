On the other hand, when querying documents which have automatically been linked to entities and semantic categories, auto-completion has not been investigated much. We have developed a semantic auto-completion system, where suggestions for entities and categories are computed in real-time from the context of already entered entities or categories and from entity-level co-occurrence statistics for the underlying corpus. Given the huge size of the knowledge bases that underlie this setting, a challenge is to compute the best suggestions fast enough for interactive user experience. Our demonstration shows the effectiveness of our method, and its interactive usability.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Andreas Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Andreas", "Johannes Hoffart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoffart:Johannes", "Dragan Milchevski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milchevski:Dragan", "Gerhard Weikum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weikum:Gerhard"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
