{"title": "Learning a Hierarchical Monitoring System for Detecting and Diagnosing Service Issues.", "fields": ["operator", "telemetry", "distributed data store", "unsupervised learning", "visualization"], "abstract": "We propose a machine learning based framework for building a hierarchical monitoring system to detect and diagnose service issues. We demonstrate its use for building a monitoring system for a distributed data storage and computing service consisting of tens of thousands of machines. Our solution has been deployed in production as an end-to-end system, starting from telemetry data collection from individual machines, to a visualization tool for service operators to examine the detection outputs. Evaluation results are presented on detecting 19 customer impacting issues in the past three months.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Vinod Nair.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nair:Vinod", "Ameya Raul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raul:Ameya", "Shwetabh Khanduja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khanduja:Shwetabh", "Vikas Bahirwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bahirwani:Vikas", "Sundararajan Sellamanickam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sellamanickam:Sundararajan", "S.
