Evolutionary algorithms have been widely used to tackle multi-objective problems. These algorithms use different measures to ensure diversity in the objective space but are not guided by a formal notion of approximation. We present a new framework of an evolutionary algorithm for multi-objective optimization that allows to work with a formal notion of approximation. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in terms of the quality of the approximation that is obtained in particular for problems with many objectives.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "University of Adelaide", "University of Adelaide"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Karl Bringmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bringmann:Karl", "Tobias Friedrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedrich_0001:Tobias", "Frank Neumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumann_0001:Frank", "Markus Wagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagner_0007:Markus"], "pages": 6}
