{"title": "Canonical Trends: Detecting Trend Setters in Web Data.", "fields": ["publication", "mashup", "web analytics", "phenomenon", "web intelligence"], "abstract": "Much information available on the web is copied, reused or rephrased. The phenomenon that multiple web sources pick up certain information is often called trend. A central problem in the context of web data mining is to detect those web sources that are first to publish information which will give rise to a trend. We present a simple and efficient method for finding trends dominating a pool of web sources and identifying those web sources that publish the information relevant to a trend before others. We validate our approach on real data collected from influential technology news feeds.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Dept.
