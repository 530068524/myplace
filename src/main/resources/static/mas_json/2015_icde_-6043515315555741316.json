However, current implementations of bi-temporal storage systems and operators are far from optimal. In this paper, we present the Bi-temporal Timeline Index, which supports a broad range of temporal operators and exploits the special properties of an in-memory column store database system. Comprehensive performance experiments with the TPC-BiH benchmark show that algorithms based on the Bi-temporal Timeline Index outperform significantly both existing commercial database systems and state-of-the-art data structures from research.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "University of Freiburg", "University of Waterloo", "SAP AG, Walldor ... aterloo, Canada", "SAP AG, Walldor ... aterloo, Canada"], "authors": ["Martin Kaufmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufmann:Martin", "Peter M.
