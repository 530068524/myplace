Meanwhile, static configurations of networks and hosts simplify this adversarial reconnaissance. In this paper, we present a novel proactive-adaptive defense technique that turns end-hosts into untraceable moving targets, and establishes dynamics into static systems by monitoring the adversarial behavior and reconfiguring the addresses of network hosts adaptively. This adaptability is achieved by discovering hazardous network ranges and addresses and evacuating network hosts from them quickly. Our approach maximizes adaptability by (1) using fast and accurate hypothesis testing for characterization of adversarial behavior, and (2) achieving a very fast IP randomization (i.e., update) rate through separating randomization from end-hosts and managing it via network appliances. The architecture and protocols of our approach can be transparently deployed on legacy networks, as well as software-defined networks. Our extensive analysis and evaluation show that by adaptive distortion of adversarial reconnaissance, our approach slows down the attack and increases its detectability, thus significantly raising the bar against stealthy scanning, major classes of evasive scanning and worm propagation, as well as targeted (hacking) attacks.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "authors": ["Jafar Haadi Jafarian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jafarian:Jafar_Haadi", "Ehab Al-Shaer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Al=Shaer:Ehab", "Qi Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Qi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
