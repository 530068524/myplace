The algorithm is super-linear ( O ( nlogn )) and computationally expensive for large datasets. Given the need for speed, we propose a fast heuristic algorithm for Dbscan using density based sampling, which performs equally well in quality compared to exact algorithms, but is more than an order of magnitude faster. Our experiments on astrophysics and synthetic massive datasets (8.5 billion numbers) shows that our approximate algorithm is up to 56x faster than exact algorithms with almost identical quality (Omega-Index \u2265 0.99). We develop a new parallel Dbscan algorithm, which uses dynamic partitioning to improve load balancing and locality. We demonstrate near-linear speedup on shared memory (15x using 16 cores, single node Intel \u00ae  Xeon \u00ae  processor) and distributed memory (3917x using 4096 cores, multinode) computers, with 2x additional performance improvement using Intel \u00ae  Xeon Phi \u2122  coprocessors. Additionally, existing exact algorithms can achieve up to 3.4 times speedup using dynamic partitioning.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "University of Bergen", "Argonne National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Md.
