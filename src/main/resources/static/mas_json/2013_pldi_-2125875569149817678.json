{"title": "Monadic abstract interpreters.", "fields": ["monad", "abstract machine", "unification", "operational semantics", "lambda calculus"], "abstract": "Recent developments in the systematic construction of abstract interpreters hinted at the possibility of a broad unification of concepts in static analysis. We deliver that unification by showing context-sensitivity, polyvariance, flow-sensitivity, reachability-pruning, heap-cloning and cardinality-bounding to be independent of any particular semantics. Monads become the unifying agent between these concepts and between semantics. For instance, by plugging the same \"context-insensitivity monad\" into a monadically-parameterized semantics for Java or for the lambda calculus, it yields the expected context-insensitive analysis.   To achieve this unification, we develop a systematic method for transforming a concrete semantics into a monadically-parameterized abstract machine. Changing the monad changes the behavior of the machine. By changing the monad, we recover a spectrum of machines---from the original concrete semantics to a monovariant, flow- and context-insensitive static analysis with a singly-threaded heap and weak updates.   The monadic parameterization also suggests an abstraction over the ubiquitous monotone fixed-point computation found in static analysis. This abstraction makes it straightforward to instrument an analysis with high-level strategies for improving precision and performance, such as abstract garbage collection and widening.   While the paper itself runs the development for continuation-passing style, our generic implementation replays it for direct-style lambda-calculus and Featherweight Java to support generality.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["IMDEA", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of Utah", "Aarhus University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Ilya Sergey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sergey:Ilya", "Dominique Devriese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Devriese:Dominique", "Matthew Might.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Might:Matthew", "Jan Midtgaard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Midtgaard:Jan", "David Darais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darais:David", "Dave Clarke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clarke_0001:Dave", "Frank Piessens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piessens:Frank"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
