As long as the linearizable implementation satisfies certain regularity properties (informally, that every method has an inverse), we define a simple wrapper for the linearizable implementation that guarantees that concurrent transactions without inherent conflicts can synchronize at the same granularity as the original linearizable implementation.", "citation": "Citations (280)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Maurice Herlihy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herlihy:Maurice", "Eric Koskinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koskinen:Eric"], "pages": 10}
