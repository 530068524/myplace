Gaussian processes have been widely used since they provide an elegant way to model the fitness and to deal with the exploration-exploitation trade-off in a principled way. Several empirical criteria have been proposed to drive the model optimization, among which is the well-known Expected Improvement criterion. The major computational bottleneck of these algorithms is the exhaustive grid search used to optimize the highly multimodal merit function. In this paper, we propose a competitive \"adaptive grid\" approach, based on a properly derived cross-entropy optimization algorithm with mixture proposals. Experiments suggest that 1) we outperform the classical single-Gaussian cross-entropy method when the fitness function is highly multimodal, and 2) we improve on standard exhaustive search in GP-based surrogate optimization.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud"], "authors": ["R\u00e9mi Bardenet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardenet:R=eacute=mi", "Bal\u00e1zs K\u00e9gl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=eacute=gl:Bal=aacute=zs"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
