At the same time, smartphones are also increasingly becoming the target of malware. Many emerging malware can utilize the proximity of devices to propagate in a distributed manner, thus remaining unobserved and making detections substantially more challenging. Different from existing malware coping schemes, which are either totally centralized or purely distributed, we propose a Community-based Proximity Malware Coping scheme, CPMC. CPMC utilizes the social community structure, which reflects a stable and controllable granularity of security, in smartphone-based mobile networks. The CPMC scheme integrates short-term coping components, which deal with individual malware, and long-term evaluation components, which offer vulnerability evaluation towards individual nodes. A closeness-oriented delegation forwarding scheme combined with a community level quarantine method is proposed as the short-term coping components. These components contain a proximity malware by quickly propagating the signature of a detected malware into all communities while avoiding unnecessary redundancy. The long-term components offer vulnerability evaluation towards neighbors, based on the observed infection history, to help users make comprehensive communication decisions. Extensive real- and synthetic-trace driven simulation results are presented to to evaluate the effectiveness of CPMC.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "departments": ["Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis", "Florida Atlantic University", "Temple University"], "authors": ["Feng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Feng", "Yinying Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yinying", "Jie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Jie"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
