{"title": "Finite-Valued Lukasiewicz Modal Logic Is PSPACE-Complete.", "fields": ["modal \u03bc calculus", "accessibility relation", "strict conditional", "normal modal logic", "classical modal logic"], "abstract": "It is well-known that satisfiability (and hence validity) in the minimal classical modal logic is a PSPACE-complete problem. In this paper we consider the satisfiability and validity problems (here they are not dual, although mutually reducible) for the minimal modal logic over a finite Lukasiewicz chain, and show that they also are PSPACE-complete. This result is also true when adding either the Delta operator or truth constants in the language, i.e. in all these cases it is PSPACE-complete.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Barcelona", "Spanish National Research Council", "Spanish National Research Council"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["F\u00e9lix Bou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bou:F=eacute=lix", "Marco Cerami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cerami:Marco", "Francesc Esteva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esteva:Francesc"], "pages": 6}
