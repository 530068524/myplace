In this paper, we propose the first novel approach to automatically generate a topically relevant event chronicle during a certain period given a reference chronicle during another period. Our approach consists of two core components \u2013 a timeaware hierarchical Bayesian model for event detection, and a learning-to-rank model to select the salient events to construct the final chronicle. Experimental results demonstrate our approach is promising to tackle this new problem.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Tao Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Tao", "Wenzhe Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Wenzhe", "Heng Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Heng", "Sujian Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Sujian", "Baobao Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Baobao", "Zhifang Sui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sui:Zhifang"], "pages": 11}
