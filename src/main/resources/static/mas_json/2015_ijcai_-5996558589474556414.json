As an effective solution to linking different heterogeneous ontologies, ontology matching has attracted considerable attentions in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based approach to ontology matching problem. Different from previous work, we formulate ontology matching as a random walk process on the association graph constructed from the to-be-matched ontologies. In particular, two variants of the conventional random walk process, namely, Affinity-Preserving Random Walk (APRW) and Mapping-Oriented Random Walk (MORW), have been proposed to alleviate the adverse effect of the false-mapping nodes in the association graph and to incorporate the 1-to-1 matching constraints presumed in ontology matching, respectively. Experiments on the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI1) datasets show that our approach achieves a competitive performance when compared with state-of-the-art systems, even though our approach does not utilize any external resources.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Chuncheng Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Chuncheng", "Baobao Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Baobao", "Zhifang Sui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sui:Zhifang"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
