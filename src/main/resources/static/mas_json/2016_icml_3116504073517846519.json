Traditionally, unsupervised learning of PFA is performed through algorithms that iteratively improves the likelihood like the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Recently, learning algorithms based on the so-called Method of Moments (MoM) have been proposed as a much faster alternative that comes with PAC-style guarantees. However, these algorithms do not ensure the learnt automata to model a proper distribution, limiting their applicability and preventing them to serve as an initialization to iterative algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new MoM-based algorithm with PAC-style guarantees that learns automata defining proper distributions. We assess its performances on synthetic problems from the PAutomaC challenge and real datasets extracted from Wikipedia against previous MoM-based algorithms and EM algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["university of lille", "Institut Universitaire de France"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Hadrien Glaude.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glaude:Hadrien", "Olivier Pietquin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pietquin:Olivier"], "pages": 10}
