{"title": "A Topic Similarity Model for Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation.", "fields": ["phrase", "exploit", "topic model", "nist", "machine translation"], "abstract": "Previous work using topic model for statistical machine translation (SMT) explore topic information at the word level. However, SMT has been advanced from word-based paradigm to phrase/rule-based paradigm. We therefore propose a topic similarity model to exploit topic information at the synchronous rule level for hierarchical phrase-based translation. We associate each synchronous rule with a topic distribution, and select desirable rules according to the similarity of their topic distributions with given documents. We show that our model significantly improves the translation performance over the baseline on NIST Chinese-to-English translation experiments. Our model also achieves a better performance and a faster speed than previous approaches that work at the word level.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Human Language  ... ocomm Research", "Human Language  ... ocomm Research"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xinyan Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Xinyan", "Deyi Xiong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiong:Deyi", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Min", "Qun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Qun", "Shouxun Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Shouxun"], "pages": 9}
