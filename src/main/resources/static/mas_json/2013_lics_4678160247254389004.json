{"title": "From Frame Properties to Hypersequent Rules in Modal Logics.", "fields": ["accessibility relation", "kripke structure", "normal modal logic", "s5", "kripke semantics"], "abstract": "We provide a general method for generating cut-free and/or analytic hyper sequent Gent Zen-type calculi for a variety of normal modal logics. The method applies to all modal logics characterized by Kripke frames, transitive Kripke frames, or symmetric Kripke frames satisfying some properties, given by first-order formulas of a certain simple form. This includes the logics KT, KD, S4, S5, K4D, K4.2, K4.3, KBD, KBT, and other modal logics, for some of which no Gentzen calculi was presented before. Cut-admissibility (or analyticity in the case of symmetric Kripke frames) is proved semantically in a uniform way for all constructed calculi. The decidability of each modal logic in this class immediately follows.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Ori Lahav.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lahav:Ori"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
