{"title": "Fact Checking in Community Forums.", "fields": ["question answering", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Community Question Answering (cQA) forums are very popular nowadays, as they represent effective means for communities around particular topics to share information. Unfortunately, this information is not always factual. Thus, here we explore a new dimension in the context of cQA, which has been ignored so far: checking the veracity of answers to particular questions in cQA forums. As this is a new problem, we create a specialized dataset for it. We further propose a novel multi-faceted model, which captures information from the answer content (what is said and how), from the author profile (who says it), from the rest of the community forum (where it is said), and from external authoritative sources of information (external support). Evaluation results show a MAP value of 86.54, which is 21 points absolute above the baseline.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Sofia University", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Tsvetomila Mihaylova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mihaylova:Tsvetomila", "Preslav Nakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakov:Preslav", "Llu\u00eds M\u00e0rquez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=agrave=rquez:Llu=iacute=s", "Alberto Barr\u00f3n-Cede\u00f1o.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barr=oacute=n=Cede=ntilde=o:Alberto", "Mitra Mohtarami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohtarami:Mitra", "Georgi Karadzhov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karadzhov:Georgi", "James R.
