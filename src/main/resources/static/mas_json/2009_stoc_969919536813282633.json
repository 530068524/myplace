{"title": "A new approach to auctions and resilient mechanism design.", "fields": ["solution concept", "revenue", "collusion", "combinatorial auction", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "We put forward a new approach to mechanism design, and exemplify it via a new mechanism guaranteeing significant revenue in unrestricted combinatorial auctions. Our mechanism (1) succeeds in a new and very adversarial collusion model; (2) works in a new, equilibrium-less, and very strong solution concept; (3) benchmarks its performance against the knowledge that the players have about each other; (4) is computationally efficient and preserves the players' privacy to an unusual extent.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jing Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Jing", "Silvio Micali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micali:Silvio"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
