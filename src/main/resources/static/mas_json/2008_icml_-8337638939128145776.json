The resulting prediction algorithm is applied to predict results of football and tennis matches, with well-known bookmakers playing the role of experts. The theoretical performance guarantee is not excessively loose on the football data set and is rather tight on the tennis data set.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of London", "University of London"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Vladimir Vovk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vovk:Vladimir", "Fedor Zhdanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhdanov:Fedor"], "pages": 8}
