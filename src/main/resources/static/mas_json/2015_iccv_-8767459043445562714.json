{"title": "Contour Box: Rejecting Object Proposals without Explicit Closed Contours.", "fields": ["global optimum", "bounded function", "polar coordinate system", "completeness", "path integral formulation"], "abstract": "Closed contour is an important objectness indicator. We propose a new measure subject to the completeness and tightness constraints, where the optimized closed contour should be tightly bounded within an object proposal. The closed contour measure is defined using closed path integral, and we solve the optimization problem efficiently in polar coordinate system with a global optimum guaranteed. Extensive experiments show that our method can reject a large number of false proposals, and achieve over 6% improvement in object recall at the challenging overlap threshold 0.8 on the VOC 2007 test dataset.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Cewu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Cewu", "Shu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shu", "Jiaya Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jiaya", "Chi-Keung Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Chi=Keung"], "pages": 9}
