While a number of recovery techniques have been proposed, they suffer from known inaccuracies. Furthermore, these techniques are difficult to evaluate due to a lack of \u201cground-truth\u201d architectures that are known to be accurate. To address this problem, we argue for establishing a suite of ground-truth architectures, using a recovery framework proposed in our recent work. This framework considers domain-, application-, and context-specific information about a system, and addresses an inherent obstacle in establishing a ground-truth architecture - the limited availability of engineers who are closely familiar with the system in question. In this paper, we present our experience in recovering the ground-truth architectures of four open-source systems. We discuss the primary insights gained in the process, analyze the characteristics of the obtained ground-truth architectures, and reflect on the involvement of the systems' engineers in a limited but critical fashion. Our findings suggest the practical feasibility of obtaining ground-truth architectures for large systems and encourage future efforts directed at establishing a large scale repository of such architectures.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Joshua Garcia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia:Joshua", "Ivo Krka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krka:Ivo", "Chris Mattmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mattmann:Chris", "Nenad Medvidovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medvidovic:Nenad"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
