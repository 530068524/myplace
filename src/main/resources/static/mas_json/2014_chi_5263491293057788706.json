This suggests that it is important to investigate information visualization systems that can dynamically adapt to each user. In this paper, we address the question of  how to adapt . In particular, we present a study to evaluate a variety of visual prompts, called \"interventions\", that can be performed on a visualization to help users process it. Our results show that some of the tested interventions perform better than a condition in which no intervention is provided, both in terms of task performance as well as subjective user ratings. We also discuss findings on how intervention effectiveness is influenced by individual differences and task complexity.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Giuseppe Carenini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carenini:Giuseppe", "Cristina Conati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Conati:Cristina", "Enamul Hoque.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoque:Enamul", "Ben Steichen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steichen:Ben", "Dereck Toker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Toker:Dereck", "James T.
