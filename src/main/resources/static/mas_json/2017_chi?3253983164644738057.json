{"title": "FaceShare: Mirroring with Pseudo-Smile Enriches Video Chat Communications.", "fields": ["videophone", "closeness", "expression", "mirroring", "computer supported cooperative work"], "abstract": "\"Mirroring\" refers to the unconscious mimicry of another person's behaviors, such as their facial expressions. Mirroring has many positive effects, such as enhancing closeness and improving the flow of a conversation, which enriches the quality of communication. Our study set out to devise a means of evoking these positive effects in a video chat without any conscious effort of participants. We constructed a videophone system, called  FaceShare , which can deform the user's face into a smile in response to their partner's smiling. That is, our system generates mirroring by producing a pseudo-smile through image processing. We conducted an experiment in which pairs of participants had brief conversations via  FaceShare . The results implied that mirroring using the pseudo-smile lets the mimicker, whose face is deformed according to the expressions of their partner, feel a closeness, and improves the flow of the conversation for both the mimicker and the mimickee, who sees the mimicker's deformed face.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Keita Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Keita", "Masanori Yokoyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yokoyama:Masanori", "Shigeo Yoshida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshida:Shigeo", "Takayoshi Mochizuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mochizuki:Takayoshi", "Tomohiro Yamada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamada:Tomohiro", "Takuji Narumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narumi:Takuji", "Tomohiro Tanikawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanikawa:Tomohiro", "Michitaka Hirose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirose:Michitaka"], "pages": 5}
