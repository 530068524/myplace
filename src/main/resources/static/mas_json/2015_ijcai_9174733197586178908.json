{"title": "A Study of Human-Agent Collaboration for Multi-UAV Task Allocation in Dynamic Environments.", "fields": ["simulation", "disaster recovery", "computer science", "supervisory control"], "abstract": "We consider a setting where a team of humans oversee the coordination of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to perform a number of search tasks in dynamic environments that may cause the UAVs to drop out. Hence, we develop a set of multi-UAV supervisory control interfaces and a multi-agent coordination algorithm to support human decision making in this setting. To elucidate the resulting interactional issues, we compare manual and mixed-initiative task allocation in both static and dynamic environments in lab studies with 40 participants and observe that our mixed initiative system results in lower workloads and better performance in re-planning tasks than one which only involves manual task allocation. Our analysis points to new insights into the way humans appropriate flexible autonomy.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Nottingham", "University of Southampton", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Sarvapali D.
