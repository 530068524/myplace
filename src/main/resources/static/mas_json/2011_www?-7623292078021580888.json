We present the system design and rationale for a novel social coordination mechanism, called \"Suggestions,\" that addresses these issues. Our system integrates ideas drawn from designs of lightweight polling systems and one's social network into an open calendar tool, providing a space for users to coordinate, socialize around, or negotiate the \"what\" and the \"when\" of their events. Suggestions was released inside a large enterprise setting, where initial interviews revealed users' thoughts on transparent scheduling, reaching wider audiences and task appropriateness, and suggested ways to improve our design.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Mikhil Masli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masli:Mikhil", "Werner Geyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geyer:Werner", "Casey Dugan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dugan:Casey", "Beth Brownholtz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brownholtz:Beth"], "conf": "www", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
