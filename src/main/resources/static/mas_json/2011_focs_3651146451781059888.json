In particular, our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of O(log 3   n  log 2   k ) for any metric space on  n  points. Our algorithm improves upon the deterministic (2 k -1)-competitive algorithm of Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou 1995] for a wide range of  n .", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "IBM", "Open University of Israel", "Microsoft", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technical Unive ... ty of Eindhoven"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Nikhil Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Nikhil", "Niv Buchbinder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buchbinder:Niv", "Aleksander Madry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madry:Aleksander", "Joseph Naor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naor:Joseph"], "pages": 10}
