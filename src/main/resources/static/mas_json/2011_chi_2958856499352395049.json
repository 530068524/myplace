{"title": "TorusDesktop: pointing via the backdoor is sometimes shorter.", "fields": ["cursor", "backdoor", "jump", "pointer", "display size"], "abstract": "When pointing to a target on a computer desktop, we may think we are taking the shortest possible path. But new shortcuts become possible if we allow the mouse cursor to jump from one edge of the screen to the opposite one, i.e., if we turn the desktop into a torus. We discuss the design of TORUSDESKTOP, a pointing technique that allows to wrap the cursor around screen edges to open this pointing backdoor. A dead zone and an off-screen cursor feedback make the technique more usable and more compatible with everyday desktop usage. We report on three controlled experiments conducted to refine the design of the technique and evaluate its performance. The results suggest clear benefits of using the backdoor when target distance is more than 80% the screen size in our experimental conditions.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Paris-Sud", "University of Paris-Sud", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["St\u00e9phane Huot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huot:St=eacute=phane", "Olivier Chapuis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chapuis:Olivier", "Pierre Dragicevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dragicevic:Pierre"], "pages": 10}
