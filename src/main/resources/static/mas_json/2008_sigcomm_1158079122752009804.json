{"title": "Answering what-if deployment and configuration questions with wise.", "fields": ["data center", "network management", "peering", "software deployment", "specification language"], "abstract": "Designers of content distribution networks often need to determine how changes to infrastructure deployment and configuration affect service response times when they deploy a new data center, change ISP peering, or change the mapping of clients to servers. Today, the designers use coarse, back-of-the-envelope calculations, or costly field deployments; they need better ways to evaluate the effects of such hypothetical \"what-if\" questions before the actual deployments. This paper presents What-If Scenario Evaluator (WISE), a tool that predicts the effects of possible configuration and deployment changes in content distribution networks. WISE makes three contributions: (1) an algorithm that uses traces from existing deployments to learn causality among factors that affect service response-time distributions; (2) an algorithm that uses the learned causal structure to estimate a dataset that is representative of the hypothetical scenario that a designer may wish to evaluate, and uses these datasets to predict future response-time distributions; (3) a scenario specification language that allows a network designer to easily express hypothetical deployment scenarios without being cognizant of the dependencies between variables that affect service response times. Our evaluation, both in a controlled setting and in a real-world field deployment at a large, global CDN, shows that WISE can quickly and accurately predict service response-time distributions for many practical What-If scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Google", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Muhammad Mukarram Bin Tariq.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tariq:Muhammad_Mukarram_Bin", "Amgad Zeitoun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeitoun:Amgad", "Vytautas Valancius.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valancius:Vytautas", "Nick Feamster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feamster:Nick", "Mostafa H.
