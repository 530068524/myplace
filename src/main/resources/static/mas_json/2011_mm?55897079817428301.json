{"title": "Flower power.", "fields": ["immersion", "computer vision", "multimedia", "computer graphics images", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "Flower Power is an interactive installation that creates immersive light atmospheres by capturing the colors of flowers and re-projecting them in the environment. A camera is suspended over a flower bed and its position depends on the positions of the visitors around the installation, which are detected using presence sensors. The image captured by the camera is rendered into the surrounding environment as a suggestive, saturated light scene. The participants can thus give the power to their favorite flower to set the overall light experience. In this paper we describe the motivation and the realization of the installation, and we discuss insights and reactions collected during the 2010 STRP Festival.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Philips", "Philips", "Philips", "Studio:ludens,  ... en, Netherlands", "Little Mountain ... en, Netherlands"], "authors": ["Gianluca Monaci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monaci:Gianluca", "Tommaso Gritti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gritti:Tommaso", "Fabio Vignoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vignoli:Fabio", "Wouter Walmink.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walmink:Wouter", "Maarten Hendriks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hendriks:Maarten"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
