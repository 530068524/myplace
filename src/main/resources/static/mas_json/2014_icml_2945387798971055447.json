In real world applications such as scene recognition problems, the widely used low-level input features can fail to explain the high-level semantic label concepts. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a novel patch-based latent variable model to integrate latent contextual representation learning and classification model training in one joint optimization framework. Within this framework, the latent layer of variables bridge the gap between inputs and outputs by providing discriminative explanations for the semantic output labels, while being predictable from the low-level input features. Experiments conducted on standard scene recognition tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, comparing to the state-of-the-art scene recognition methods.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Temple University", "Temple University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0013:Xin", "Yuhong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yuhong"], "pages": 9}
