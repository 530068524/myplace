{"title": "Implicit-storing and redundant-encoding-of-attribute information in error-correction-codes.", "fields": ["encoding", "cache", "code", "decoding methods", "invariant"], "abstract": "This paper proposes implicit-storing to extend the logical capacity of a memory array without increasing its physical capacity by leveraging the array's error-correction-codes to infer the implicitly stored bits. Implicit-storing is related to error-code-tagging, a technique that distinguishes between faults in data and invariant attributes of a location when the attributes are not stored in the memory array but are encoded in the error-correction-codes. Both error-code-tagging and implicit-storing cause a code-strength reduction due to their encoding of additional information in the code meant to only protect data.   Redundant-encoding-of-attributes is introduced to improve the strength of a code by encoding same information in multiple codewords in a cache or memory. We demonstrate how EREA and IREA, two derivatives of redundant-encoding, alleviate the code-strength reduction experienced by error-code-tagging and implicit-storing respectively.   Implementing the proposed methods requires minor modifications in the encoding and decoding logic of the baseline error-correction scheme used in this work. The paper discusses several uses of the proposed schemes to help demonstrate their usefulness.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Cyprus", "NXP Semiconductors", "University of Cyprus", "University of Cyprus", "ARM"], "authors": ["Yiannakis Sazeides.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sazeides:Yiannakis", "Emre \u00d6zer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ouml=zer:Emre", "Danny Kershaw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kershaw:Danny", "Panagiota Nikolaou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikolaou:Panagiota", "Marios Kleanthous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kleanthous:Marios", "Jaume Abella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abella:Jaume"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
