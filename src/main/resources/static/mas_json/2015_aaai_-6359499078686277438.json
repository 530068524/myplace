{"title": "Realistic Assumptions for Attacks on Elections.", "fields": ["management science", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "computer security", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We must properly model attacks and the preferences of the electorate for the computational study of attacks on elections to give us insight into the hardness of attacks in practice. Theoretical and empirical analysis are equally important methods to understand election attacks. I discuss my recent work on domain restrictions on partial preferences and on new election attacks. I propose further study into modeling realistic election attacks and the advancement of the current state of empirical analysis of their hardness by using more advanced statistical techniques.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rochester Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Zack Fitzsimmons.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fitzsimmons:Zack"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 102}
