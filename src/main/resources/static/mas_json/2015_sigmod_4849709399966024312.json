{"title": "How to Build Templates for RDF Question/Answering: An Uncertain Graph Similarity Join Approach.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "rdf", "rdf schema", "graph database", "sparql"], "abstract": "A challenging task in the natural language question answering (Q/A for short) over RDF knowledge graph is how to bridge the gap between unstructured natural language questions (NLQ) and graph-structured RDF data ( G One of the effective tools is the \"template\", which is often used in many existing RDF Q/A systems. However, few of them study how to generate templates automatically. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a join approach for template generation. Given a workload  D  of SPARQL queries and a set  N  of natural language questions, the goal is to find some pairs  q, n , for  q \u2208  D  \u2227  n  \u2208,  N , where SPARQL query  q  is the best match for natural language question  n . These pairs provide promising hints for automatic template generation. Due to the ambiguity of the natural languages, we model the problem above as an uncertain graph join task. We propose several structural and probability pruning techniques to speed up joining. Extensive experiments over real RDF Q/A benchmark datasets confirm both the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "University of Texas\u2013Pan American", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Weiguo Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Weiguo", "Lei Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou_0001:Lei", "Xiang Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Xiang", "Jeffrey Xu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jeffrey_Xu", "Shaoxu Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Shaoxu", "Dongyan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Dongyan"], "pages": 16}
