We studied ThermoCoach, which performs eco-coaching for thermostat scheduling. It senses and models occupancy patterns in a home, and provides occupants alternative suggestions for configuring their thermostat. Our study shows that eco-coaching accomplished four things. First, it made it easier for users to implement an effective thermostat schedule. Second, it supported user agency in negotiating energy savings and comfort goals. Third, it facilitated learning different scheduling strategies as well as weighing different options. Finally, it challenged users' beliefs about how well they were doing. These outcomes, in turn, were successful in getting users to employ and experiment with more efficient setback strategies. Going forward, we propose ways that eco-coaching systems could better support users in customizing and assessing the systems' recommendations.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "University of Michigan", "Fors Marsh Group"], "authors": ["Rayoung Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Rayoung", "Devika Pisharoty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pisharoty:Devika", "Soodeh Montazeri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montazeri:Soodeh", "Kamin Whitehouse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whitehouse:Kamin", "Mark W.
