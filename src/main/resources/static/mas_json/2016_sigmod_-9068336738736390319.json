Yet, there is very little work on using voice-based interfaces to query database systems. In fact, one might even wonder who in her right mind would want to query a database system using voice commands! With this demonstration, we make the case for querying database systems using a voice-based interface, a new querying and interaction paradigm we call Query-by-Voice (QbV). We will demonstrate the practicality and utility of QbV for relational DBMSs using a using a proof-of-concept system called EchoQuery. To achieve a smooth and intuitive interaction, the query interface of EchoQuery is inspired by casual human-to-human conversations. Our demo will show that voice-based interfaces present an intuitive means of querying and consuming data in a database. It will also highlight the unique advantages of QbV over the more traditional approaches, text-based or visual interfaces, for applications where context switching is too expensive, too risky or even not possible at all.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Gabriel Lyons.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyons:Gabriel", "Vinh Tran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tran:Vinh", "Carsten Binnig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Binnig:Carsten", "Ugur \u00c7etintemel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ccedil=etintemel:Ugur", "Tim Kraska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kraska:Tim"], "pages": 4}
