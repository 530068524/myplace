It is commonly believed that web search click logs are a gold mine for search business, because they reflect users' preference over web documents presented by the search engine. Click models provide a principled approach to inferring user-perceived relevance of web documents, which can be leveraged in numerous applications in search businesses. Due to the huge volume of click data, scalability is a must.   We present the click chain model (CCM), which is based on a solid, Bayesian framework. It is both scalable and incremental, perfectly meeting the computational challenges imposed by the voluminous click logs that constantly grow. We conduct an extensive experimental study on a data set containing 8.8 million query sessions obtained in July 2008 from a commercial search engine. CCM consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art competitors in a number of metrics, with over 9.7% better log-likelihood, over 6.2% better click perplexity and much more robust (up to 30%) prediction of the first and the last clicked position.", "citation": "Citations (193)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Fan Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Fan", "Chao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Chao", "Anitha Kannan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kannan:Anitha", "Tom Minka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minka:Tom", "Michael J.
