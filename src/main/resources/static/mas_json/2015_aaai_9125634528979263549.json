{"title": "Fast and Accurate Prediction of Sentence Specificity.", "fields": ["sentence", "syntax", "parsing", "part of speech tagging", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that specificity is an important characterization of texts potentially beneficial for a range of applications such as multi-document news summarization and analysis of science journalism. The feasibility of automatically predicting sentence specificity from a rich set of features has also been confirmed in prior work. In this paper we present a practical system for predicting sentence specificity which exploits only features that require minimum processing and is trained in a semi-supervised manner. Our system outperforms the state-of-the-art method for predicting sentence specificity and does not require part of speech tagging or syntactic parsing as the prior methods did. With the tool that we developed \u2014 SPECITELLER \u2014 we study the role of specificity in sentence simplification. We show that specificity is a useful indicator for finding sentences that need to be simplified and a useful objective for simplification, descriptive of the differences between original and simplified sentences.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Junyi Jessy Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Junyi_Jessy", "Ani Nenkova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nenkova:Ani"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
