Conventionally, a number of full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) methods adopted various computational models of the human visual system (HVS) from psychological vision science research. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural networks (CNN) based FR-IQA model, named Deep Image Quality Assessment (DeepQA), where the behavior of the HVS is learned from the underlying data distribution of IQA databases. Different from previous studies, our model seeks the optimal visual weight based on understanding of database information itself without any prior knowledge of the HVS. Through the experiments, we show that the predicted visual sensitivity maps agree with the human subjective opinions. In addition, DeepQA achieves the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy among FR-IQA models.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Yonsei University", "Yonsei University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jongyoo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jongyoo", "Sanghoon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Sanghoon"], "pages": 9}
