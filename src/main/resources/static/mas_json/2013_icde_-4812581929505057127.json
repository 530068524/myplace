Standard benchmarks such as TPC-C and TPC-H provide a way of comparing the performance of different systems. In addition, micro benchmarks can be exploited to test a specific behavior of a system. Yet, despite all the benefits that can be derived from benchmark results, the effort of implementing and executing benchmarks remains prohibitive: Database systems need to be set up, a large number of artifacts such as data generators and queries need to be managed and complex, time-consuming operations have to be orchestrated. In this demo, we introduce a generic benchmarking service that combines a rich meta model, low marginal cost and ease of use, which drastically reduces the time and cost to define, adapt and run a benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "University of Freiburg", "ETH Zurich", "SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany"], "authors": ["Martin Kaufmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufmann:Martin", "Peter M.
