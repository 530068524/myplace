Specifically, we are interested in the extraction of behavior models from execution traces.   In this paper we introduce mining of branching-time scenarios in the form of existential, conditional Live Sequence Charts, using a statistical data-mining algorithm. We show the power of branching scenarios to reveal alternative scenario-based behaviors, which could not be mined by previous approaches.   The work contrasts and complements previous works on mining linear-time scenarios. An implementation and evaluation over execution trace sets recorded from several real-world applications shows the unique contribution of mining branching-time scenarios to the state-of-the-art in specification mining.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Tel Aviv University", "Singapore Manag ... pore, Singapore"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Dirk Fahland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fahland:Dirk", "David Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo_0001:David", "Shahar Maoz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maoz:Shahar"], "pages": 11}
