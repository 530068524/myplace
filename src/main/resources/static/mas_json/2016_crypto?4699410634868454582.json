Their design is mainly guided by industrial standards with only informal security promises.\n\nIn this paper we propose cryptographic models for the security of such APIs. The key feature of our approach is that it enables modular analysis. Specifically, we show that a secure cryptographic API can be obtained by combining a secure API for key-management together with secure implementations of, for instance, encryption or message authentication. Our models are the first to provide such compositional guarantees while considering realistic adversaries that can adaptively corrupt keys stored on tokens. We also provide a proof of concept instantiation from a deterministic authenticated-encryption scheme of the key-management portion of cryptographic API.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Bristol", "University of Bristol"], "authors": ["Thomas Shrimpton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrimpton:Thomas", "Martijn Stam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stam:Martijn", "Bogdan Warinschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Warinschi:Bogdan"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2016", "pages": 31}
