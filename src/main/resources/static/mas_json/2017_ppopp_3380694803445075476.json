{"title": "Using Butterfly-Patterned Partial Sums to Draw from Discrete Distributions.", "fields": ["binary search algorithm", "transpose", "cuda", "latent dirichlet allocation", "topic model"], "abstract": "We describe a SIMD technique for drawing values from multiple discrete distributions, such as sampling from the random variables of a mixture model, that avoids computing a complete table of partial sums of the relative probabilities. A table of alternate (\"butterfly-patterned\") form is faster to compute, making better use of coalesced memory accesses; from this table, complete partial sums are computed on the fly during a binary search. Measurements using CUDA 7.5 on an NVIDIA Titan Black GPU show that this technique makes an entire machine-learning application that uses a Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model with 1024 topics about about 13% faster (when using single-precision floating-point data) or about 35% faster (when using double-precision floating-point data) than doing a straightforward matrix transposition after using coalesced accesses.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Guy L.
