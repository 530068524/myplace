{"title": "3D all the way: Semantic segmentation of urban scenes from start to end in 3D.", "fields": ["facade", "segmentation", "quadratic programming", "3d city models", "boosting"], "abstract": "We propose a new approach for semantic segmentation of 3D city models. Starting from an SfM reconstruction of a street-side scene, we perform classification and facade splitting purely in 3D, obviating the need for slow image-based semantic segmentation methods. We show that a properly trained pure-3D approach produces high quality labelings, with significant speed benefits (20x faster) allowing us to analyze entire streets in a matter of minutes. Additionally, if speed is not of the essence, the 3D labeling can be combined with the results of a state-of-the-art 2D classifier, further boosting the performance. Further, we propose a novel facade separation based on semantic nuances between facades. Finally, inspired by the use of architectural principles for 2D facade labeling, we propose new 3D-specific principles and an efficient optimization scheme based on an integer quadratic programming formulation.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "ETH Zurich", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Andelo Martinovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martinovic:Andelo", "Jan Knopp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knopp:Jan", "Hayko Riemenschneider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riemenschneider:Hayko", "Luc J.
