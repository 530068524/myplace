{"title": "Effect of constraints on superpeer topologies.", "fields": ["cache", "social network", "cpu cache", "network topology", "bootstrapping"], "abstract": "In superpeer based networks, the superpeers are discovered through the process of bootstrapping, whereby resourceful peers get upgraded to superpeers. However, bootstrapping is influenced by several factors like limitation on the maximum number of connections a peer can have due to bandwidth constraints, limitation on the availability of information of existing peers due to cache size constraints and also by the attachment policy of the newly arriving peers to the resourceful peers. In this paper, we derive closed form equations that model the effect of these factors on superpeer related topological properties of the networks. Based on the model, we observe that the cache parameters and the preferentiality parameters must be suitably tuned so as to increase the fraction of superpeers in the network. Finally, we perform an empirical analysis of social networks like Twitter and Facebook using our model to obtain and derive insights for suitably bootstrapping superpeer topology.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Catholic University of Leuven", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"], "authors": ["Joydeep Chandra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandra:Joydeep", "Bivas Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Bivas", "Niloy Ganguly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganguly:Niloy"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
