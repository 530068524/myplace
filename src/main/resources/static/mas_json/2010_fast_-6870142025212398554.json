{"title": "Extending SSD Lifetimes with Disk-Based Write Caches.", "fields": ["latency", "bandwidth", "cache", "parallel computing", "solid state"], "abstract": "We present Griffin, a hybrid storage device that uses a hard disk drive (HDD) as a write cache for a Solid State Device (SSD). Griffin is motivated by two observations: First, HDDs can match the sequential write bandwidth of mid-range SSDs. Second, both server and desktop workloads contain a significant fraction of block overwrites. By maintaining a log-structured HDD cache and migrating cached data periodically, Griffin reduces writes to the SSD while retaining its excellent performance. We evaluate Griffin using a variety of I/O traces from Windows systems and show that it extends SSD lifetime by a factor of two and reduces average I/O latency by 56%.", "citation": "Citations (288)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Gokul Soundararajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soundararajan:Gokul", "Vijayan Prabhakaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakaran:Vijayan", "Mahesh Balakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balakrishnan_0001:Mahesh", "Ted Wobber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wobber:Ted"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2010", "pages": 14}
