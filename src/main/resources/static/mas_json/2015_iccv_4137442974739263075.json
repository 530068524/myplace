{"title": "Dense Image Registration and Deformable Surface Reconstruction in Presence of Occlusions and Minimal Texture.", "fields": ["computer vision", "image registration", "surface reconstruction", "3d reconstruction", "monocular"], "abstract": "Deformable surface tracking from monocular images is well-known to be under-constrained. Occlusions often make the task even more challenging, and can result in failure if the surface is not sufficiently textured. In this work, we explicitly address the problem of 3D reconstruction of poorly textured, occluded surfaces, proposing a framework based on a template-matching approach that scales dense robust features by a relevancy score. Our approach is extensively compared to current methods employing both local feature matching and dense template alignment. We test on standard datasets as well as on a new dataset (that will be made publicly available) of a sparsely textured, occluded surface. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results for both well and poorly textured, occluded surfaces.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "KAIST", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "KAIST"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Dat Tien Ngo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ngo:Dat_Tien", "Sanghyuk Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Sanghyuk", "Anne Jorstad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jorstad:Anne", "Alberto Crivellaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crivellaro:Alberto", "Chang Dong Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Chang_Dong", "Pascal Fua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fua:Pascal"], "pages": 9}
