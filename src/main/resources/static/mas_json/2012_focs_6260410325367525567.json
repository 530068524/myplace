In this article we work in the LOCAL model (where the input graph and underlying distributed network are identical) and study the  randomized  complexity of four fundamental symmetry-breaking problems on graphs: computing MISs (maximal independent sets), maximal matchings, vertex colorings, and ruling sets. A small sample of our results includes the following:   \u2014An MIS algorithm running in  O (log 2 D \u0394 L 2\u221alog  n , and comes close to the \u03a9(flog \u0394 log log \u0394 lower bound of Kuhn, Moscibroda, and Wattenhofer.   \u2014A maximal matching algorithm running in  O (log\u2009\u0394 + log\u2009 4 log\u2009 n ) time. This is the first significant improvement to the 1986 algorithm of Israeli and Itai. Moreover, its dependence on \u0394 is  nearly optimal .   \u2014A (\u0394 + 1)-coloring algorithm requiring  O (log \u0394 + 2  o (\u221alog log  n )  time, improving on an  O (log \u0394 + \u221alog  n )-time algorithm of Schneider and Wattenhofer.   \u2014A method for reducing symmetry-breaking problems in low arboricity/degeneracy graphs to low-degree graphs. (Roughly speaking, the arboricity or degeneracy of a graph bounds the density of any subgraph.) Corollaries of this reduction include an  O (\u221alog  n )-time maximal matching algorithm for graphs with arboricity up to 2\u221alog  n  and an  O (log\u2009 2/3  n )-time MIS algorithm for graphs with arboricity up to 2 (log  n )1/3 .   Each of our algorithms is based on a simple but powerful technique for reducing a  randomized  symmetry-breaking task to a corresponding  deterministic  one on a poly(log\u2009 n )-size graph.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Michigan", "ETH Zurich", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "University of Michigan", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Leonid Barenboim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barenboim:Leonid", "Michael Elkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkin:Michael", "Seth Pettie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pettie:Seth", "Johannes Schneider.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schneider:Johannes"], "pages": 10}
