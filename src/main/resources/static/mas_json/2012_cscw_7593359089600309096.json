{"title": "Impression management work: how seniors with chronic pain address disruptions in their interactions.", "fields": ["social relation", "social isolation", "autonomy", "chronic pain", "impression management"], "abstract": "Chronic pain is an illness that affects nearly a third of senior citizens. Uncontrolled chronic pain can manifest constantly and/or intermittently, and can disrupt seniors' ability to plan or to maintain synchronous and scheduled contact with others. Such disruptions can expose seniors to stigma from others who do not understand this illness, social isolation, and a range of challenges to their social autonomy. We present results from an interview study of 27 seniors with chronic pain exploring how they mitigate and manage these disruptions in their lives. Drawing on Goffman's theory of impression management, we found that participants invested significant effort into controlling both the context of interactions and others' expectations, in order to mitigate the potential negative social consequences of disruptions. In performing this work, seniors were selective about what information they revealed to others about their chronic pain and availability. Given such efforts, seniors with chronic pain have unique needs for technologies to support their social interactions.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "Cornell University", "University of Toronto", "Simon Fraser University", "Toronto Rehabilitation Institute"], "authors": ["Alison Benjamin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benjamin:Alison", "Jeremy P.
