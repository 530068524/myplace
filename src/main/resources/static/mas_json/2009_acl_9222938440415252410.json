{"title": "Better Word Alignments with Supervised ITG Models.", "fields": ["bleu", "parsing", "discriminative model", "natural language processing", "sentence"], "abstract": "This work investigates supervised word alignment methods that exploit inversion transduction grammar (ITG) constraints. We consider maximum margin and conditional likelihood objectives, including the presentation of a new normal form grammar for canonicalizing derivations. Even for non-ITG sentence pairs, we show that it is possible learn ITG alignment models by simple relaxations of structured discriminative learning objectives. For efficiency, we describe a set of pruning techniques that together allow us to align sentences two orders of magnitude faster than naive bitext CKY parsing. Finally, we introduce many-to-one block alignment features, which significantly improve our ITG models. Altogether, our method results in the best reported AER numbers for Chinese-English and a performance improvement of 1.1 BLEU over GIZA++ alignments.", "citation": "Citations (118)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Aria Haghighi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haghighi:Aria", "John Blitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blitzer:John", "John DeNero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeNero:John", "Dan Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Dan"], "pages": 9}
