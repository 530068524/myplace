{"title": "Diagnosing New York city's noises with ubiquitous data.", "fields": ["phone", "loud music", "baseline", "timestamp", "urban computing"], "abstract": "Many cities suffer from noise pollution, which compromises people's working efficiency and even mental health. New York City (NYC) has opened a platform, entitled 311, to allow people to complain about the city's issues by using a mobile app or making a phone call;  noise  is the third largest category of complaints in the 311 data. As each complaint about noises is associated with a location, a time stamp, and a fine-grained noise category, such as \" Loud Music\"  or \" Construction\" , the data is actually a result of \" human as a sensor \" and \" crowd sensing \", containing rich human intelligence that can help diagnose urban noises. In this paper we infer the fine-grained noise situation (consisting of a noise pollution indicator and the composition of noises) of different times of day for each region of NYC, by using the 311 complaint data together with social media, road network data, and Points of Interests (POIs). We model the noise situation of NYC with a three dimension tensor, where the three dimensions stand for regions, noise categories, and time slots, respectively. Supplementing the missing entries of the tensor through a context-aware tensor decomposition approach, we recover the noise situation throughout NYC. The information can inform people and officials' decision making. We evaluate our method with four real datasets, verifying the advantages of our method beyond four baselines, such as the interpolation-based approach.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Microsoft", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "New Jersey Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yu Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0004:Yu", "Tong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Tong", "Yilun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yilun", "Yanmin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yanmin", "Yanchi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yanchi", "Eric Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Eric"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
