This paper examines its operational characteristics.   By a series of reasoning steps, we systematically unpack the standard-order reduction relation of the calculus and discover a novel abstract machine definition which, like the calculus, goes \"under lambdas.\" We prove that machine evaluation is equivalent to standard-order evaluation.   Unlike traditional abstract machines, delimited control plays a significant role in the machine's behavior. In particular, the machine replaces the manipulation of a heap using store-based effects with disciplined management of the evaluation stack using control-based effects. In short, state is replaced with control.   To further articulate this observation, we present a simulation of call-by-need in a call-by-value language using delimited control operations.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Indiana University", "Indiana University"], "authors": ["Ronald Garcia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garcia:Ronald", "Andrew Lumsdaine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lumsdaine:Andrew", "Amr Sabry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabry:Amr"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2009", "pages": 12}
