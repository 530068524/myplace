In the core of these applications, lies a common and critical problem: Given a labeled network and a query graph, how to efficiently search the query graph in the target network. The presence of noise and the incomplete knowledge about the structure and content of the target network make it unrealistic to find an exact match. Rather, it is more appealing to find the top-k approximate matches.   In this paper, we propose a neighborhood-based similarity measure that could avoid costly graph isomorphism and edit distance computation. Under this new measure, we prove that subgraph similarity search is NP hard, while graph similarity match is polynomial. By studying the principles behind this measure, we found an information propagation model that is able to convert a large network into a set of multidimensional vectors, where sophisticated indexing and similarity search algorithms are available. The proposed method, called Ness (Neighborhood Based Similarity Search), is appropriate for graphs with low automorphism and high noise, which are common in many social and information networks. Ness is not only efficient, but also robust against structural noise and information loss. Empirical results show that it can quickly and accurately find high-quality matches in large networks, with negligible cost.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Arijit Khan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khan:Arijit", "Nan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Nan", "Xifeng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Xifeng", "Ziyu Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Ziyu", "Supriyo Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty:Supriyo", "Shu Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Shu"], "pages": 12}
