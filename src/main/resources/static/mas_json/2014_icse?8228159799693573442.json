When goals are assigned to an agent, they have to be operationalised: the agent\u2019s operations have to be refined, by equipping them with appropriate enabling and triggering conditions, so that the goals are fulfilled. Goal operationalisation generally demands a significant effort of the engineer. Although there exist approaches that tackle this problem, they are either informal or at most semi automated, requiring the engineer to assist in the process. In this paper, we present an approach for goal operationalisation that automatically computes required preconditions and required triggering conditions for operations, so that the resulting operations establish the goals. The process is iterative, is able to deal with safety goals and particular kinds of liveness goals, and is based on the use of interpolation and SAT solving.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "University of Buenos Aires", "Universidad Nac ... arto, Argentina", "Universidad Nac ... arto, Argentina"], "authors": ["Renzo Degiovanni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Degiovanni:Renzo", "Dalal Alrajeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alrajeh:Dalal", "Nazareno Aguirre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aguirre:Nazareno", "Sebasti\u00e1n Uchitel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uchitel:Sebasti=aacute=n"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2014", "pages": 11}
