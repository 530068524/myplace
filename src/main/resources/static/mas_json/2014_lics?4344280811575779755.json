{"title": "Two-way cost automata and cost logics over infinite trees.", "fields": ["\u03c9 automaton", "monad", "domain theory", "quantum finite automata", "computability"], "abstract": "Regular cost functions provide a quantitative extension of regular languages that retains most of their important properties, such as expressive power and decidability, at least over finite and infinite words and over finite trees. Much less is known over infinite trees.   We consider cost functions over infinite trees defined by an extension of weak monadic second-order logic with a new fixed-point-like operator. We show this logic to be decidable, improving previously known decidability results for cost logics over infinite trees. The proof relies on an equivalence with a form of automata with counters called quasi-weak cost automata, as well as results about converting two-way alternating cost automata to one-way alternating cost automata.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Paris Diderot University", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Achim Blumensath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blumensath:Achim", "Thomas Colcombet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colcombet:Thomas", "Denis Kuperberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuperberg:Denis", "Pawel Parys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parys:Pawel", "Michael Vanden Boom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boom:Michael_Vanden"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
