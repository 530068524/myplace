The local model can be regarded as an extension of Karger and Ruhl's expansion dimension to a statistical setting in which the distribution of distances to a query point is modeled in terms of a continuous random variable. This form of intrinsic dimensionality can be particularly useful in search, classification, outlier detection, and other contexts in machine learning, databases, and data mining, as it has been shown to be equivalent to a measure of the discriminative power of similarity functions. Several estimators of local ID are proposed and analyzed based on extreme value theory, using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the method of moments (MoM), probability weighted moments (PWM), and regularly varying functions (RV). An experimental evaluation is also provided, using both real and artificial data.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "National Institute of Informatics", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "National Institute of Informatics"], "authors": ["Laurent Amsaleg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amsaleg:Laurent", "Oussama Chelly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chelly:Oussama", "Teddy Furon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furon:Teddy", "St\u00e9phane Girard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Girard:St=eacute=phane", "Michael E.
