{"title": "Building castles out of mud: practical access pattern privacy and correctness on untrusted storage.", "fields": ["implementation", "correctness", "queries per second", "private information retrieval", "oblivious ram"], "abstract": "We introduce a new practical mechanism for remote data storage with efficient access pattern privacy and correctness. A storage client can deploy this mechanism to issue encrypted reads, writes, and inserts to a potentially curious and malicious storage service provider, without revealing information or access patterns. The provider is unable to establish any correlation between successive accesses, or even to distinguish between a read and a write. Moreover, the client is provided with strong correctness assurances for its operations -- illicit provider behavior does not go undetected. We built a first practical system -- orders of magnitude faster than existing implementations -- that can execute over several queries per second on 1Tbyte+ databases with full computational privacy and correctness.", "citation": "Citations (258)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Motorola"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Peter Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Peter", "Radu Sion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sion:Radu", "Bogdan Carbunar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carbunar:Bogdan"], "pages": 10}
