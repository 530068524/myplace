The deployment was the result of thorough evaluation and an online trial of a number of methods, including profile-based, collaborative filtering and hybrid algorithms. Results taken a few months after deployment show that key metrics generally hold their value or show an increase compared to the trial results, and that the recommender system delivered its projected benefits.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales", "University of Tasmania", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "authors": ["Alfred Krzywicki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krzywicki:Alfred", "Wayne Wobcke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wobcke:Wayne", "Yang Sok Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Yang_Sok", "Xiongcai Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Xiongcai", "Michael Bain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bain:Michael", "Paul Compton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Compton:Paul", "Ashesh Mahidadia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahidadia:Ashesh"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 8}
