To capture the intermediate states of sketches, a three-way representation learner is first utilized to extract the visual features. These deep features are simultaneously fed into the visual and sequential networks to capture spatial and temporal properties, respectively. More specifically, visual networks are novelly proposed to learn the stroke patterns by stacking the Residual Fully-Connected (R-FC) layers, which integrate ReLU and Tanh activation functions to achieve the sparsity and generalization ability. To learn the patterns of stroke order, sequential networks are constructed by Residual Long Short-Term Memory (R-LSTM) units, which optimize the network architecture by skip connection. Finally, the visual and sequential representations of the sketches are seamlessly integrated with a fusion layer to obtain the final results. Experiments conducted on the benchmark sketch dataset TU-Berlin demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Southwest Jiaotong University", "Southwest Jiaotong University", "Fudan University", "Southwest Jiaotong University", "Southwest Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Jun-Yan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Jun=Yan", "Xiao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Xiao", "Yu-Gang Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yu=Gang", "Bo Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Bo", "Qiang Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Qiang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
