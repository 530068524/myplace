To make it possible to quantitatively compare different approaches to this problem in realistic settings, we present a ground-truth dataset of intrinsic image decompositions for a variety of real-world objects. For each object, we separate an image of it into three components: Lambertian shading, reflectance, and specularities. We use our dataset to quantitatively compare several existing algorithms; we hope that this dataset will serve as a means for evaluating future work on intrinsic images.", "citation": "Citations (238)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Roger B.
