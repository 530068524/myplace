In this paper, we consider the multi-graph SBM, which serves as a foundation for many application settings including dynamic and multi-layer networks. We explore the asymptotic properties of two estimators for the multi-graph SBM, namely spectral clustering and the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE), as the number of layers of the multigraph increases. We derive sufficient conditions for consistency of both estimators and propose a variational approximation to the MLE that is computationally feasible for large networks. We verify the sufficient conditions via simulation and demonstrate that they are practical. In addition, we apply the model to two real data sets: a dynamic social network and a multi-layer social network with several types of relations.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Technicolor", "Harvard University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Qiuyi Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Qiuyi", "Kevin S.
