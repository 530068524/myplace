What is the role of human-computer interaction (HCI) design in this shift' In this paper we draw from five design projects to explore how design can express matters of concern by communicating the factors and consequences of issues. In the process, we consider the role of design in contributing to the formation of publics and discuss an emerging orientation to publics in HCI design.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Tennessee", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Nokio, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Carl F.
