Its mathematical cleanness identifies essential structures in computation; moreover its use as a compilation technique from programs to state machines---\"GoI implementation,\" so to speak---has been worked out by Mackie, Ghica and others. In this paper, we develop Abramsky's idea of  resumption based GoI  systematically into a generic framework that accounts for computational effects (nondeterminism, probability, exception, global states, interactive I/O, etc.). The framework is categorical: Plotkin & Power's  algebraic operations  provide an interface to computational effects; the framework is built on the categorical axiomatization of GoI by Abramsky, Haghverdi and Scott; and, by use of the coalgebraic formalization of  component calculus , we describe explicit construction of state machines as interpretations of functional programs. The resulting interpretation is shown to be sound with respect to equations between algebraic operations, as well as to Moggi's equations for the computational lambda calculus. We illustrate the construction by concrete examples.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Naohiko Hoshino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoshino:Naohiko", "Koko Muroya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muroya:Koko", "Ichiro Hasuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasuo:Ichiro"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
