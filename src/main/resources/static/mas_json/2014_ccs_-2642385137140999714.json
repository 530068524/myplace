To this end, we propose two novel techniques, a  pointer -based technique and a  locality -based technique. We show that these two techniques are powerful building blocks in making data structures and algorithms oblivious. Specifically, we apply these techniques to a broad range of commonly used data structures, including maps, sets, priority-queues, stacks, deques; and algorithms, including a memory allocator algorithm, max-flow on graphs with low doubling dimension, and shortest-path distance queries on weighted planar graphs. Our oblivious counterparts of the above outperform the best known ORAM scheme both asymptotically and in practice.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Xiao Shaun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiao_Shaun", "Kartik Nayak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nayak:Kartik", "Chang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Chang", "T.-H.
