Based on backwards search in labeled sequent calculi, the procedure employs a novel termination condition and countermodel construction. Using the procedure, it is argued that multi-modal variants of several classical and intuitionistic logics including K, T, K4, S4 and their combinations with D are decidable and have the finite model property. At least in the intuitionistic multi-modal case, the decidability results are new. It is further shown that the countermodels produced by the procedure, starting from a set of hypotheses and no goals, characterize the atomic formulas provable from the hypotheses.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Helsinki"], "authors": ["Deepak Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg_0001:Deepak", "Valerio Genovese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Genovese:Valerio", "Sara Negri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Negri:Sara"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
