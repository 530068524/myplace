{"title": "Decidability of Non-interactive Simulation of Joint Distributions.", "fields": ["mathematics", "combinatorics", "discrete mathematics", "lemma", "joint probability distribution", "decidability", "bounded function", "alice and bob"], "abstract": "We present decidability results for a sub-class of \"non-interactive\" simulation problems, a well-studied class of problems in information theory. A non-interactive simulation problem is specified by two distributions P(x, y) and Q(u, v): The goal is to determine if two players, Alice and Bob, that observe sequences Xn and Yn respectively where {(Xi, Yi)}ni = 1 are drawn i.i.d. from P(x, y) can generate pairs U and V respectively (without communicating with each other) with a joint distribution that is arbitrarily close in total variation to Q(u, v). Even when P and Q are extremely simple: e.g., P is uniform on the triples (0, 0), (0,1), (1,0) and Q is a \"doubly symmetric binary source\", i.e., U and V are uniform \u00b1 1 variables with correlation say 0.49, it is open if P can simulate Q. In this work, we show that whenever P is a distribution on a finite domain and Q is a 2 \u00d7 2 distribution, then the non-interactive simulation problem is decidable: specifically, given \u03b4 > 0 the algorithm runs in time bounded by some function of P and \u03b4 and either gives a non-interactive simulation protocol that is \u03b4-close to Q or asserts that no protocol gets O(\u03b4)-close to Q. The main challenge to such a result is determining explicit (computable) convergence bounds on the number n of samples that need to be drawn from P(x, y) to get \u03b4-close to Q. We invoke contemporary results from the analysis of Boolean functions such as the invariance principle and a regularity lemma to obtain such explicit bounds.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Badih Ghazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghazi:Badih", "Pritish Kamath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamath:Pritish", "Madhu Sudan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sudan:Madhu"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
