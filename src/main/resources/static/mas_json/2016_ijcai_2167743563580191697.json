A detailed complexity analysis of coherence testing and cautious reasoning under the new semantics highlighted similarities and differences versus mainstream stable model semantics for aggregates, which eventually led to the design of compilation techniques for implementing the new semantics on top of existing ASP solvers.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Calabria", "University of Calabria"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Mario Alviano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alviano:Mario", "Nicola Leone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leone:Nicola"], "pages": 5}
