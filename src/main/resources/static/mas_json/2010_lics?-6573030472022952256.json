In this paper we introduce a new, strong notion of maximal paraconsistency, which is based on possible extensions of the consequence relation of a logic. We investigate this notion in the framework of finite-valued paraconsistent logics, and show that for every $n>2$ there exists an extensive family of $n$-valued logics, each of which is maximally paraconsistent in our sense, is partial to classical logic, and is not equivalent to any $k$-valued logic with $k", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Jerusalem College of Engineering, Chennai", "Sch. of Comput. ... el-Aviv, Israel"], "authors": ["Arnon Avron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avron:Arnon", "Ofer Arieli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arieli:Ofer", "Anna Zamansky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zamansky:Anna"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
