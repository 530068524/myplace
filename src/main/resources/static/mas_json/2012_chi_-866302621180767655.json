Architectural sized largescale screens can result in unbalanced installations, and meaningful interaction is easily overshadowed by the drastic size of the display. In this paper we reflect on urban technology interventions by analyzing their spatial configuration in relation to the structuring of interaction. We outline basic categories and offer a new terminology to describe these interactive situations designed for the built environment.", "citation": "Citations (116)", "departments": ["University of Strathclyde", "University of Strathclyde"], "authors": ["Patrick Tobias Fischer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischer:Patrick_Tobias", "Eva Hornecker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hornecker:Eva"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
