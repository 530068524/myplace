{"title": "Circuit lower bounds for nondeterministic quasi-polytime: an easy witness lemma for NP and NQP.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "nexptime", "nondeterministic algorithm", "lemma", "discrete mathematics", "ntime", "witness"], "abstract": "We prove that if every problem in  NP  has  n   k  -size circuits for a fixed constant  k , then for every  NP -verifier and every yes-instance  x  of length  n  for that verifier, the verifier\u2019s search space has an  n   O ( k  3 ) -size witness circuit: a witness for  x  that can be encoded with a circuit of only  n   O ( k  3 )  size. An analogous statement is proved for nondeterministic quasi-polynomial time, i.e.,  NQP  =  NTIME [ n  log  O (1)   n  ]. This significantly extends the Easy Witness Lemma of Impagliazzo, Kabanets, and Wigderson [JCSS\u201902] which only held for larger nondeterministic classes such as  NEXP .    As a consequence, the connections between circuit-analysis algorithms and circuit lower bounds can be considerably sharpened: algorithms for approximately counting satisfying assignments to given circuits which improve over exhaustive search can imply circuit lower bounds for functions in  NQP  or even  NP . To illustrate, applying known algorithms for satisfiability of  ACC  \u2218  THR  circuits [R. Williams, STOC 2014] we conclude that for every fixed  k ,  NQP  does not have  n  log  k    n  -size  ACC  \u2218  THR  circuits.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Cody Murray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murray:Cody", "R.
