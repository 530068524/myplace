Decisions are based on a Particle Filter for estimating the belief state given past observations. We consider a policy gradient approach for parameterized policy optimization. For that purpose, we investigate sensitivity analysis of the performance measure with respect to the parameters of the policy, focusing on Finite Difference (FD) techniques. We show that the naive FD is subject to variance explosion because of the non-smoothness of the resampling procedure. We propose a more sophisticated FD method which overcomes this problem and establish its consistency.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "Columbia University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Pierre-Arnaud Coquelin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coquelin:Pierre=Arnaud", "Romain Deguest.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deguest:Romain", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi"], "pages": 8}
