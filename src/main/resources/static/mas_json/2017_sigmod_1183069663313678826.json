{"title": "The Best of Both Worlds: Big Data Programming with Both Productivity and Performance.", "fields": ["python", "operator", "programming paradigm", "big data", "scala"], "abstract": "Coarse-grained operators such as  map  and  reduce  have been widely used for large-scale data processing. While they are easy to master, over-simplified APIs sometimes hinder programmers from fine-grained control on how computation is performed and hence designing more efficient algorithms. On the other hand, resorting to domain-specific languages (DSLs) is also not a practical solution, since programmers may need to learn how to use many systems that can be very different from each other, and the use of low-level tools may even result in bug-prone programming.   In [7] our prior work, we proposed  Husky  which provides a highly expressive API to solve the above dilemma. It allows developers to program in a variety of patterns, such as MapReduce, GAS, vertex-centric programs, and even asynchronous machine learning. While the Husky C++ engine provides great performance, in this demo proposal we introduce PyHusky and ScHusky, which allow users (e.g., data scientists) without system knowledge and low-level programming skills to leverage the performance of Husky and build high-level applications with ease using Python and Scala.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Fan Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Fan", "Yuzhen Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Yuzhen", "Yunjian Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yunjian", "Jinfeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jinfeng", "Guanxian Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Guanxian", "James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James"], "pages": 4}
