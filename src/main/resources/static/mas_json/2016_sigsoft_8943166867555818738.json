{"title": "API deprecation: a retrospective analysis and detection method for code examples on the web.", "fields": ["deprecation", "android", "stack overflow", "application programming interface", "source code"], "abstract": "Deprecation allows the developers of application programming interfaces (APIs) to signal to other developers that a given API item ought to be avoided. But little is known about deprecation practices beyond anecdotes. We examine how API deprecation has been used in 26 open source Java frameworks and libraries, finding that the classic deprecate\u2013replace\u2013remove cycle is often not followed, as many APIs were removed without prior deprecation, many deprecated APIs were subsequently un-deprecated, and removed APIs are even resurrected with surprising frequency. Furthermore, we identify several problems in the information commonly (not) provided to help API consumers transition their dependent code.     As a consequence of deprecation, coding examples on the web --- an increasingly important source of information for developers --- can easily become outdated. Code examples that demonstrate how to use deprecated APIs can be difficult to disregard and a waste of time for developers. We propose a lightweight, version-sensitive framework to detect deprecated API usages in source code examples on the web so developers can be informed of such usages before they invest time and energy into studying them. We reify the framework as a prototype tool (Deprecation Watcher). Our evaluation on detecting deprecated Android API usages in code examples on Stack Overflow shows our tool obtains a precision of 100% and a recall of 86% in a random sample of 200 questions.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Jing Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Jing", "Robert J.
