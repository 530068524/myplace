Passive estimation of craving from sensor data in the natural environment can be used to assist users in coping with craving. In this paper, we take the first steps towards developing a computational model to estimate cigarette craving (during smoking abstinence) at the minute-level using mobile sensor data. We use 2,012 hours of sensor data and 1,812 craving self-reports from 61 participants in a smoking cessation study. To estimate craving, we first obtain a continuous measure of stress from sensor data. We find that during hours of day when craving is high, stress associated with self-reported high craving is greater than stress associated with low craving. We use this and other insights to develop feature functions, and encode them as pattern detectors in a Conditional Random Field (CRF) based model to infer craving probabilities.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Troy University", "University of Minnesota", "University of Mephis", "University of Mephis", "University of Mephis"], "authors": ["Soujanya Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Soujanya", "Karen Hovsepian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hovsepian:Karen", "Hillol Sarker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarker:Hillol", "Nazir Saleheen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saleheen:Nazir", "Mustafa al'Absi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/al=Absi:Mustafa", "Gowtham Atluri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atluri:Gowtham", "Emre Ertin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ertin:Emre", "Cho Lam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lam:Cho", "Andrine Lemieux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lemieux:Andrine", "Motohiro Nakajima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakajima:Motohiro", "Bonnie Spring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spring:Bonnie", "David W.
