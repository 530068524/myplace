{"title": "A polynomial-time bound for matching and registration with outliers.", "fields": ["ransac", "triangulation", "image registration", "affine transformation", "heuristics"], "abstract": "We present a framework for computing optimal transformations, aligning one point set to another, in the presence of outliers. Example applications include shape matching and registration (using, for example, similarity, affine or projective transformations) as well as multiview reconstruction problems (triangulation, camera pose etc.). While standard methods like RANSAC essentially use heuristics to cope with outliers, we seek to find the largest possible subset of consistent correspondences and the globally optimal transformation aligning the point sets. Based on theory from computational geometry, we show that this is indeed possible to accomplish in polynomial-time. We develop several algorithms which make efficient use of convex programming. The scheme has been tested and evaluated on both synthetic and real data for several applications.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Lund University", "Lund University", "Lund University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Carl Olsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olsson:Carl", "Olof Enqvist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Enqvist:Olof", "Fredrik Kahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kahl:Fredrik"], "pages": -1}
