Assuming that preferences are ceteris paribus allows for their concise representation as Conditional Preference Networks (CP-nets). This work presents the first empirical investigation of an algorithm for reliably and efficiently learning CP-nets in a manner that is minimally intrusive. At the same time, it introduces a novel process for efficiently reasoning with (the learned) preferences.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Open University of Cyprus", "Open University of Cyprus"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Loizos Michael.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michael:Loizos", "Elena Papageorgiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papageorgiou:Elena"], "pages": 7}
