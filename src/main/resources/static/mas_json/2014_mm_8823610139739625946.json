{"title": "What are the Fashion Trends in New York?", "fields": ["multimedia", "computer science"], "abstract": "Fashion is a reflection of the society of a period. Given that New York City is one of the world's fashion capitals, understanding its change in fashion becomes a way to know the society and the times. To keep up with fashion trends, it is important to know what's \" in\" and what's \"out\" for a season. Though the fashion trends have been analyzed by fashion designers and fashion analysts for a long time, this issue has been ignored in multimedia science. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that automatically discovers visual style elements representing fashion trends for a certain season. The visual style elements are discovered based on the stylistic coherent and unique characteristics. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through a large number of catwalk show videos.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University of Science and Technology", "National Taiwan University of Science and Technology", "Academia Sinica", "Taipei National University of the Arts"], "authors": ["Shintami Chusnul Hidayati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hidayati:Shintami_Chusnul", "Kai-Lung Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Kai=Lung", "Wen-Huang Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wen=Huang", "Shih-Wei Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Shih=Wei"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
