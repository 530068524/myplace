Unfortunately, the need for collecting private information in PWS has become a major barrier for its wide proliferation. We study privacy protection in PWS engines which capture personalities in user profiles. We propose a PWS framework called UPS that can generalize profiles in for each query according to user-specified privacy requirements. Two predictive metrics are proposed to evaluate the privacy breach risk and the query utility for hierarchical user profile. We develop two simple but effective generalization algorithms for user profiles allowing for query-level customization using our proposed metrics. We also provide an online prediction mechanism based on query utility for deciding whether to personalize a query in UPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Gang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Gang", "He Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:He", "Lidan Shou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shou:Lidan", "Ke Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0005:Ke", "Yunjun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yunjun"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
