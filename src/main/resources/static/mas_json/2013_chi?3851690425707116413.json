{"title": "\"I need to try this\"?: a statistical overview of pinterest.", "fields": ["computer science", "multimedia", "snapshot", "leverage", "social network"], "abstract": "Over the past decade, social network sites have become ubiquitous places for people to maintain relationships, as well as loci of intense research interest. Recently, a new site has exploded into prominence:  Pinterest  became the fastest social network to reach 10M users, growing 4000% in 2011 alone. While many Pinterest articles have appeared in the popular press, there has been little scholarly work so far. In this paper, we use a quantitative approach to study three research questions about the site. What drives activity on Pinterest? What role does gender play in the site's social connections? And finally, what distinguishes Pinterest from existing networks, in particular Twitter? In short, we find that being female means more repins, but fewer followers, and that four verbs set Pinterest apart from Twitter:  use, look, want  and  need . This work serves as an early snapshot of Pinterest that later work can leverage.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Eric Gilbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilbert:Eric", "Saeideh Bakhshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bakhshi:Saeideh", "Shuo Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Shuo", "Loren G.
