Our system contains an offline module to select features from a group of reference images and an online module to match them to the input live video in order to quickly estimate the camera pose. The main contribution lies in constructing an optimal set of keyframes from the input reference images, which are required to approximately cover the entire space and at the same time minimize the content redundancy amongst the selected frames. This strategy not only greatly saves the computation, but also helps significantly reduce the number of repeated features so as to improve the camera tracking quality. Our system also employs a parallel-computing scheme with multi-CPU hardware architecture. Experimental results show that our method dramatically enhances the computation efficiency and eliminates the jittering artifacts.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Zilong Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Zilong", "Guofeng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Guofeng", "Jiaya Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jiaya", "Hujun Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Hujun"], "pages": 8}
