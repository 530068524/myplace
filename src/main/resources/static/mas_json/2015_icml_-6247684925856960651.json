Our algorithms improve upon the fastest running time for empirical risk minimization (ERM), and in particular linear least-squares regression, across a wide range of problem settings.\n\nTo achieve this, we establish a framework, based on the classical proximal point algorithm, useful for accelerating recent fast stochastic algorithms in a black-box fashion. Empirically, we demonstrate that the resulting algorithms exhibit notions of stability that are advantageous in practice. Both in theory and in practice, the provided algorithms reap the computational benefits of adding a large strongly convex regularization term, without incurring a corresponding bias to the original ERM problem.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Roy Frostig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frostig:Roy", "Rong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge_0001:Rong", "Sham Kakade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kakade:Sham", "Aaron Sidford.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sidford:Aaron"], "pages": 9}
