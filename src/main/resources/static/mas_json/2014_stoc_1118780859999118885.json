We view this as a formalization of Hayek's classic point of view that focuses on the information transfer advantages that markets have relative to centralized planning. We study two settings: combinatorial auctions with unit demand bidders (bipartite matching) and combinatorial auctions with subadditive bidders. In both settings we prove that non-interactive protocols require exponentially larger communication costs than interactive ones, even those that only use a modest amount of interaction.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Microsoft", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shahar Dobzinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobzinski:Shahar", "Noam Nisan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nisan:Noam", "Sigal Oren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oren:Sigal"], "pages": 10}
