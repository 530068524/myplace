RDC is defined in terms of correlation of random non-linear copula projections; it is invariant with respect to marginal distribution transformations, has low computational cost and is easy to implement: just five lines of R code, included at the end of the paper.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["David L\u00f3pez-Paz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=oacute=pez=Paz:David", "Philipp Hennig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hennig:Philipp", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
