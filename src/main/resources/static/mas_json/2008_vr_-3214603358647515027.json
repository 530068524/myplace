{"title": "Virtual Human + Tangible Interface = Mixed Reality Human An Initial Exploration with a Virtual Breast Exam Patient.", "fields": ["embodied agent", "virtual patient", "mixed reality", "gesture", "social engagement"], "abstract": "Virtual human (VH) experiences are receiving increased attention for training real-world interpersonal scenarios. Communication in interpersonal scenarios consists of not only speech and gestures, but also relies heavily on haptic interaction - interpersonal touch. By adding haptic interaction to VH experiences, the bandwidth of human-VH communication can be increased to approach that of human-human communication. To afford haptic interaction, a new species of embodied agent is proposed - mixed reality humans (MRHs). A MRH is a virtual human embodied by a tangible interface that shares the same registered space. The tangible interface affords the haptic interaction that is critical to effective simulation of interpersonal scenarios. We applied MRHs to simulate a virtual patient requiring a breast cancer screening (medical interview and physical exam). The design of the MRH patient is presented. This paper also presents the results of a pilot study in which eight (n = 8) physician-assistant students performed a clinical breast exam on the MRH patient. Results show that when afforded haptic interaction with a MRH patient, users demonstrated interpersonal touch and social engagement similarly to interacting with a human patient.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Aaron Kotranza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotranza:Aaron", "Benjamin Lok.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lok:Benjamin"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
