Past studies have demonstrated that modern devices present so much diversity that fingerprints can be exploited to identify and track users online. With this work, we want to evaluate browser fingerprinting is still effective at uniquely identifying a large group of users when analyzing a millions of fingerprint over a few months. We collected 2,067,942 browser fingerprints from one of the top 15 French websites. The analysis of this novel dataset sheds a new light on the ever-growing browser fingerprinting domain. The key insight is that the percentage of unique fingerprints in our dataset is much lower than what was reported in the past: only 33.6% of fingerprints are unique by opposition to over 80% in previous studies. We  show  that this observation is robust: even if fingerprints change, the degree of uniqueness does not increase.  We also confirm that the current evolution of web technology is benefiting users\u2019 privacy significantly as the removal of plugins brings down substantively the rate of unique desktop machines.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Royal Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Alejandro G\u00f3mez-Boix.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=oacute=mez=Boix:Alejandro", "Pierre Laperdrix.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laperdrix:Pierre", "Benoit Baudry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baudry:Benoit"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
