However, the production of speech comments introduces several challenges to users, including overcoming self-consciousness and time consuming editing. In this paper, we introduce TypeTalker, a speech commenting interface that presents speech as a synthesized generic voice to reduce speaker self-consciousness, while retaining the expressivity of the original speech with natural breaks and co-expressive gestures. TypeTalker streamlines speech editing through a simple textbox that respects temporal alignment across edits. A comparative evaluation shows that TypeTalker reduces speech anxiety during live-recording, and offers easier and more effective speech editing facilities than the previous state-of-the-art interface technique. A follow-up study on recipient perceptions of the produced comments suggests that while TypeTalker's generic voice may be traded-off with a loss of personal touch, it can also enhance the clarity of speech by refining the original speech's speed and accent.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Ian Arawjo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arawjo:Ian", "Dongwook Yoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoon:Dongwook", "Fran\u00e7ois Guimbreti\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guimbreti=egrave=re:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
