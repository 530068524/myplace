{"title": "When Bad Feels Good: Assistance Failures and Interface Preferences.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "user experience design", "user interface", "grid", "simulation"], "abstract": "User interfaces often attempt to assist users by automating elements of interaction, but these attempts will periodically fail -- impeding user performance. To understand the design implications of correct and incorrect assistance, we conducted an experiment in which subjects selected their preferred of two interfaces (neutral and snapping) for a series of 10 drag-and-drop tasks. With neutral the dragged object moved pixel-by-pixel, and with snapping the object snapped to a grid. Snapping trials were engineered to provide controlled levels of objective performance gains and losses with respect to neutral: gains were achieved when the target was aligned with the grid, and losses were achieved through misalignment -- which required subjects to drop the object, hold a key, and complete the task using a finer movement resolution. Results showed a significant preference for the snapping interface, even when losses impaired performance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Canterbury", "University of Canterbury"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Philip Quinn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quinn:Philip", "Andy Cockburn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cockburn:Andy"], "pages": 6}
