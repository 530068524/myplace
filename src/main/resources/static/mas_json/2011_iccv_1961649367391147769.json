In the past, this problem has been addressed by hand-crafting features which would correlate with best photographic practices (e.g. \u201cDoes this image respect the rule of thirds?\u201d) or with photographic techniques (e.g. \u201cIs this image a macro?\u201d). We depart from this line of research and propose to use generic image descriptors to assess aesthetic quality. We experimentally show that the descriptors we use, which aggregate statistics computed from low-level local features, implicitly encode the aesthetic properties explicitly used by state-of-the-art methods and outperform them by a significant margin.", "citation": "Citations (253)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Xerox", "Xerox", "Xerox", "Xerox"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Luca Marchesotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marchesotti:Luca", "Florent Perronnin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perronnin:Florent", "Diane Larlus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larlus:Diane", "Gabriela Csurka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Csurka:Gabriela"], "pages": 8}
