Traditional solutions to such problems rely on primal/dual decomposition and gradient methods, whose convergence is sensitive to the choice of the stepsize and may not be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of large-scale real-time applications. We propose a new iterative approach to distributed resource allocation in coupled systems. Without complicating message-passing, the new approach is robust to parameter choices and expedites convergence by exploiting problem structures. We theoretically analyze the asynchronous algorithm convergence conditions, and empirically evaluate its benefits in a case of cloud network resource reservation based on real-world data.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Heejun Roh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roh:Heejun", "Cheoulhoon Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Cheoulhoon", "Wonjun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wonjun", "Ding-Zhu Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Ding=Zhu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
