We analyze the standard TS algorithm for the general CMAB, and obtain the first distribution-dependent regret bound of $O(m\\log T / \\Delta_{\\min}) $ for TS under general CMAB, where $m$ is the number of arms, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\\Delta_{\\min}$ is the minimum gap between the expected reward of the optimal solution and any non-optimal solution. We also show that one can not use an approximate oracle in TS algorithm for even MAB problems. Then we expand the analysis to matroid bandit, a special case of CMAB. Finally, we use some experiments to show the comparison of regrets of CUCB and CTS algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Siwei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Siwei", "Wei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wei"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
