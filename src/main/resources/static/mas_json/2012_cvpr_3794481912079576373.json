This choice trades localization accuracy for efficient computation. We propose twisted window search, a strict generalization over rectangular window search, for the globally optimal localization of a target's shape. Despite its generality, we show that the new algorithm runs in O(n 3 ), an asymptotic time complexity that is no greater than that of rectangular window search on an image of resolution n \u00d7 n. We demonstrate improved results of twisted window search for localizing and tracking non-rigid objects with significant orientation, scale and shape change. Twisted window search runs at nearly 10 frames per second in our MATLAB/C++ implementation on images of resolution 240 \u00d7 320 on a quad-core laptop.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Steve Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Steve", "Ying Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Ying", "Carlo Tomasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomasi:Carlo"], "pages": 7}
