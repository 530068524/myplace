Software engineering researchers often scale their analysis techniques using specialized one-off solutions, expensive infrastructures, or heuristic techniques (e.g., search-based approaches). However, such efforts are not reusable and are often costly to maintain. The need for scalable analysis is very prominent in the Mining Software Repositories (MSR) field, which specializes in the automated recovery and analysis of large data stored in software repositories. In this paper, we explore the scaling of automated software engineering analysis techniques by reusing scalable analysis platforms from the web field. We use three representative case studies from the MSR field to analyze the potential of the MapReduce platform to scale MSR tools with minimal effort. We document our experience such that other researchers could benefit from them. We find that many of the web field's guidelines for using the MapReduce platform need to be modified to better fit the characteristics of software engineering problems.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Queen's University", "Queen's University", "Queen's University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Weiyi Shang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shang:Weiyi", "Bram Adams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adams:Bram", "Ahmed E.
