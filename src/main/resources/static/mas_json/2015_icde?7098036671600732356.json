To explore nearby events, mobile users can query a location based search engine for the desired data. However, operating under such a pull based model means that users may miss interesting events (because no explicit queries are issued) or processing/communication overheads may be high (because users have to continuously issue queries). In this demo, we present Elaps, an efficient location-aware publish/subscribe system that can effectively disseminate interesting events to moving users. Elaps is based on the push model and notifies mobile users instantly whenever there is a matching event around their locations. Through the demo, we will demonstrate that Elaps is scalable to a large number of subscriptions and events. Moreover, Elaps can effectively monitor the subscribers without missing any event matching, and incur low communication overhead.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Tsinghua University", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Long Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Long", "Lu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lu", "Dongxiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dongxiang", "Guoliang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Guoliang", "Kian-Lee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian=Lee", "Zhifeng Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Zhifeng"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
