Given an oracle for a received word R: F m  - -r  - e) from R for any e  r ,e -r ). The list size could be exponential in m at radius 2 -r , so our bound is optimal in the local setting. Since RM(2,m) has relative distance 2 -r , our algorithm beats the Johnson bound for r \u2265 2. In the setting where we are allowed running-time polynomial in the block-length, we show that list-decoding is possible up to even larger radii, beyond the minimum distance. We give a deterministic list-decoder that works at error rate below J(2 1-r ), where J(\u03b4) denotes the Johnson radius for minimum distance \u03b4. This shows that RM(2,m) codes are list-decodable up to radius \u03b7 for any constant \u03b7  q , we present list-decoding algorithms in both the global and local settings that work up to the list-decoding radius. We conjecture that the list-decoding radius approaches the minimum distance (like over F), and prove this holds true when the degree is divisible by q-1.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Parikshit Gopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalan:Parikshit", "Adam R.
