We present a comprehensive complexity classification of these problems, which strongly links graph-theoretic properties of  A  to the complexity of the corresponding homomorphism problem. In particular, we define a binary relation on graph classes and completely describe the resulting hierarchy given by this relation. This binary relation is defined in terms of a notion which we call graph deconstruction and which is a variant of the well-known notion of tree decomposition. We then use this hierarchy of graph classes to infer a complexity hierarchy of homomorphism problems which is comprehensive up to a computationally very weak notion of reduction, namely, a parameterized version of quantifier-free reductions. In doing so, we obtain a significantly refined complexity classification of homomorphism problems, as well as a unifying, modular, and conceptually clean treatment of existing complexity classifications. We then present and develop the theory of Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse-style pebble games which solve the homomorphism problems where the cores of the structures in  A  have bounded tree depth. Finally, we use our framework to classify the complexity of model checking existential sentences having bounded quantifier rank.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of the Basque Country", "University of Vienna", "University of the Basque Country", "University of Vienna"], "authors": ["Hubie Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hubie", "Moritz M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Moritz"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
