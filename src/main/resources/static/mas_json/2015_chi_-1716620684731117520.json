{"title": "Beyond Eco-Feedback: Adding Online Manual and Automated Controls to Promote Workplace Sustainability.", "fields": ["behavior change", "sustainability", "environmental psychology", "multimedia", "usability"], "abstract": "Whereas eco-feedback has been widely studied in HCI and environmental psychology, online manual control and automated control have been rarely studied with a focus on their long-term quantitative impact and usability. To address this, an intervention was tested with eighty office workers for twenty-seven weeks. Through the long-term field test, it was found that the addition of online controls in the feedback intervention led to more energy savings than feedback only and worked better for light and phone usage than computer and monitor usage. The addition of automated control led to the greatest savings but was less effective for efficient users than inefficient ones.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ray Yun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yun:Ray", "Azizan Aziz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aziz:Azizan", "Peter Scupelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scupelli:Peter", "Bertrand Lasternas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lasternas:Bertrand", "Chenlu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chenlu", "Vivian Loftness.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loftness:Vivian"], "pages": 4}
