{"title": "Static analysis of deterministic negotiations.", "fields": ["p", "concurrent computing", "workflow", "soundness", "static analysis"], "abstract": "Negotiation diagrams are a model of concurrent computation akin to workflow Petri nets. Deterministic negotiation diagrams, equivalent to the much studied and used free-choice workflow Petri nets, are surprisingly amenable to verification. Soundness (a property close to deadlock-freedom) can be decided in PTIME. Further, other fundamental questions like computing summaries or the expected cost, can also be solved in PTIME for sound deterministic negotiation diagrams, while they are PSPACE-complete in the general case.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "University of Bordeaux", "University of Bordeaux"], "authors": ["Javier Esparza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Esparza:Javier", "Anca Muscholl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muscholl:Anca", "Igor Walukiewicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walukiewicz:Igor"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
