Despite their reasonable results and societal value, early efforts on social indicator computing suffer from three problems: 1) labor-intensive data gathering, 2) insufficient data, and 3) expert-relied data fusion. Towards this end, we present a novel graph-based multi-channel ranking scheme for social indicator computation by exploring the rich multi-channel Web data. For each channel, this scheme presents the semi-structured and unstructured data with simple graphs and hypergraphs, respectively. It then groups the channels into different clusters according to their correlations. After that, it uses a unified model to learn the cluster-wise common spaces, perform ranking separately upon each space, and fuse these rankings to produce the final one. We take Chinese university ranking as a case study and validate our scheme over a real-world dataset. It is worth emphasizing that our scheme is applicable to computation of other social indicators, such as Educational attainment.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Shandong University", "National University of Singapore", "Hefei University of Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Fuli Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Fuli", "Liqiang Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Liqiang", "Xiang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiang", "Richang Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Richang", "Tat-Seng Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Tat=Seng"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
