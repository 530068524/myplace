{"title": "XED: Exposing On-Die Error Detection Information for Strong Memory Reliability.", "fields": ["registered memory", "memory rank", "standard raid levels", "memory controller", "dimm"], "abstract": "Large-granularity memory failures continue to be a critical impediment to system reliability. To make matters worse, as DRAM scales to smaller nodes, the frequency of unreliable bits in DRAM chips continues to increase. To mitigate such scaling-related failures, memory vendors are planning to equip existing DRAM chips with On-Die ECC. For maintaining compatibility with memory standards, On-Die ECC is kept invisible from the memory controller.   This paper explores how to design high reliability memory systems in presence of On-Die ECC. We show that if On-Die ECC is not exposed to the memory system, having a 9-chip ECC-DIMM (implementing SECDED) provides almost no reliability benefits compared to an 8-chip non-ECC DIMM. We also show that if the error detection of On-Die ECC can be exposed to the memory controller, then Chipkill-level reliability can be achieved even with a 9-chip ECC-DIMM. To this end, we propose  e X posed On-Die  E rror  D etection (XED) , which exposes the On-Die error detection information without requiring changes to the memory standards or consuming bandwidth overheads. When the On-Die ECC detects an error, XED transmits a pre-defined  \"catch-word\"  instead of the corrected data value. On receiving the catch-word, the memory controller uses the parity stored in the 9-chip of the ECC-DIMM to correct the faulty chip (similar to RAID-3). Our studies show that XED provides Chipkill-level reliability (172x higher than SECDED), while incurring negligible overheads, with a 21% lower execution time than Chipkill. We also show that XED can enable Chipkill systems to provide Double-Chipkill level reliability while avoiding the associated storage, performance, and power overheads.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Prashant J.
