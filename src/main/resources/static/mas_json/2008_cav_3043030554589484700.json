{"title": "Enhancing Program Verification with Lemmas.", "fields": ["logical consequence", "predicate", "invariant", "separation logic", "lemma"], "abstract": "One promising approach to verifying heap-manipulating programs is based on  user-defined inductive predicates in separation logic. This approach can describe data structures with complex invariants and sound reasoning based on unfold/fold. However, an important component towards more expressive program verification is the use of  lemmas that can soundly relate predicates beyond their original definitions. This paper outlines a new  automatic mechanism for proving and applying  user-specified lemmas under separation logic.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Huu Hai Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Huu_Hai", "Wei-Ngan Chin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chin:Wei=Ngan"], "pages": 15}
