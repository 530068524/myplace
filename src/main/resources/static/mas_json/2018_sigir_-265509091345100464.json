In addition to users' genuine search queries, Hide-n-Seek submits k cover queries and corresponding clicks to an external search engine to disguise a user's search intent grounded and reinforced in a search session by mimicking the true query sequence. The cover queries are synthesized and randomly sampled from a topic hierarchy, where each node represents a coherent search topic estimated by both n-gram and neural language models constructed over crawled web documents. Hide-n-Seek also personalizes the returned search results by re-ranking them based on the genuine user profile developed and maintained on the client side. With a variety of graphical user interfaces, we present the topic-based query obfuscation mechanism to the end users for them to digest how their search privacy is protected.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Wuhan University", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Puxuan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Puxuan", "Wasi Uddin Ahmad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmad:Wasi_Uddin", "Hongning Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hongning"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
