In the MRW system, multiple agents traverse a single graph simultaneously. To achieve desired interactions among those agents, a restart rule can be designed, which determines the restart distribution of each agent according to the probability distributions of all agents. In particular, we develop the repulsive rule for data clustering. We illustrate that the MRW clustering can segment real images reliably. Furthermore, we propose a novel image cosegmentation algorithm based on the MRW clustering. Specifically, the proposed algorithm consists of two steps: inter-image concurrence computation and intra-image MRW clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides promising cosegmentation performance.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Korea University", "Korea University", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Korea University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chulwoo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chulwoo", "Won-Dong Jang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jang:Won=Dong", "Jae-Young Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Jae=Young", "Chang-Su Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Chang=Su"], "pages": 9}
