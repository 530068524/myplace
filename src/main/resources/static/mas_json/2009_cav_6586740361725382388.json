In particular, specification languages based on epistemic logic [7], or logics for knowledge, have proven useful in a variety of areas including robotics, security protocols, web-services, etc. For example, security specifications involving anonymity [4] are known to be naturally expressible in epistemic formalisms as they explicitly state the lack of different kinds of knowledge of the principals.", "citation": "Citations (304)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "University College London"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Alessio Lomuscio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lomuscio:Alessio", "Hongyang Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu_0001:Hongyang", "Franco Raimondi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raimondi:Franco"], "pages": 7}
