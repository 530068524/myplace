{"title": "An Automated Passive Testing Approach for the IMS PoC Service.", "fields": ["real time computing", "computer science", "ip multimedia subsystem", "server"], "abstract": "Although the adoption of the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) keeps growing, IMS applications are often integrated to the system without being formally tested. In this work, we are interested in the IMS Push over Cellular (PoC) service, an OMA standard. We propose a conformance passive testing approach to check that its implementation respects the main standard requirements. This approach is based on a set of formal invariants representing the most relevant expected properties to be tested. Two testing phases are applied: the verification of the invariants against the service specification and their testing on the PoC collected execution traces.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Inst.
