These coding techniques can be deployed on a wide range of networked nodes, from servers in the \"cloud\" to smartphone devices. However, large-scale real-world deployment of systems using coding is still rare, mainly due to the computational complexity of coding algorithms. This is especially a concern on both extremes: in high-bandwidth servers where coding may not be able to saturate the uplink bandwidth, and in smartphone devices where hardware limitations prevail.   In this paper, we present Tenor, a comprehensive toolkit to make coding practical across awide range of networked nodes, from servers to smartphones. We strive to push the performance of our crossplatform coding toolkit to the limits allowed by o?-the-shelf hardware. To show the practicality of the Tenor toolkit in real-world network applications, it has been used to build coded on-demand media streaming systems from a GPU-based server to up to 3000 emulated nodes, and to iPhone devices with actual playback.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Hassan Shojania.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shojania:Hassan", "Baochun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Baochun"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
