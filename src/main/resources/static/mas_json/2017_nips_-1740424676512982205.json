{"title": "Nonparametric Online Regression while Learning the Metric.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "mahalanobis distance", "outer product", "nonparametric regression", "regret"], "abstract": "We study algorithms for online nonparametric regression that learn the directions along which the regression function is smoother. Our algorithm learns the Mahalanobis metric based on the gradient outer product matrix $\\boldsymbol{G}$ of the regression function (automatically adapting to the effective rank of this matrix), while simultaneously bounding the regret ---on the same data sequence--- in terms of the spectrum of $\\boldsymbol{G}$. As a preliminary step in our analysis, we extend a nonparametric online learning algorithm by Hazan and Megiddo enabling it to compete against functions whose Lipschitzness is measured with respect to an arbitrary Mahalanobis metric.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Milan"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ilja Kuzborskij.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuzborskij:Ilja", "Nicol\u00f2 Cesa-Bianchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cesa=Bianchi:Nicol=ograve="], "pages": 10}
