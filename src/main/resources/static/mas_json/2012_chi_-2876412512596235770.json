Specifically, accelerometers and gyroscopes worn on the arm (e.g., in a wristwatch) can sense arm gestures, enabling natural input in untethered scenarios. Two core components of any gesture recognition system are  detecting  when a gesture is occurring and  classifying  which gesture a person has performed. In previous work, accurate detection has required significant computation, and high-accuracy classification has come at the cost of training the system on a per-user basis. In this note, we present a gesture detection method whose computational complexity does not depend on the duration of the gesture, and describe a novel method for recognizing gestures with only a single example from a new user.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Louis Kratz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kratz:Louis", "Daniel Morris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morris_0001:Daniel", "T.
