MPI's abstraction of explicit communication across distributed memory is very popular for programming scientific applications. Unfortunately, OS-level process separations force MPI to perform unnecessary copying of messages within shared memory nodes. This paper presents a novel approach that transparently shares memory across MPI processes executing on the same node, allowing them to communicate like threaded applications. While prior work explored thread-based MPI libraries, we demonstrate that this approach is impractical and performs poorly in practice. We instead propose a novel process-based approach that enables shared memory communication and integrates with existing MPI libraries and applications without modifications. Our protocols for shared memory message passing exhibit better performance and reduced cache footprint. Communication speedups of more than 26% are demonstrated for two applications.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Indiana University", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "ETH Zurich", "Indiana University"], "authors": ["Andrew Friedley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedley:Andrew", "Greg Bronevetsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bronevetsky:Greg", "Torsten Hoefler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoefler:Torsten", "Andrew Lumsdaine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lumsdaine:Andrew"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2013", "pages": 11}
