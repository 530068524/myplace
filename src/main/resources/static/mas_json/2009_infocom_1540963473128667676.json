{"title": "Novel Architectures and Algorithms for Delay Reduction in Back-Pressure Scheduling and Routing.", "fields": ["queuing delay", "network packet", "network delay", "queue", "backpressure routing"], "abstract": "The back-pressure algorithm is a well-known throughput-optimal algorithm. However, its delay performance may be quite poor even when the traffic load is not close to network capacity due to the following two reasons. First, each node has to maintain a separate queue for each commodity in the network, and only one queue is served at a time. Second, the backpressure routing algorithm may route some packets along very long routes. In this paper, we present solutions to address both of the above issues, and hence, improve the delay performance of the back-pressure algorithm. One of the suggested solutions also decreases the complexity of the queueing data structures to be maintained at each node.", "citation": "Citations (204)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Alcatel-Lucent"], "authors": ["Loc Bui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bui:Loc", "R.
