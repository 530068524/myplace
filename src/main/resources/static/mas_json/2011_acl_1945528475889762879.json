HM decoding involves two decoding stages: first, each component system decodes independently, with the explored search space kept for use in the next step; second, a new search space is constructed by composing existing hypotheses produced by all component systems using a set of rules provided by the HM decoder itself, and a new set of model independent features are used to seek the final best translation from this new search space. Few assumptions are made by our approach about the underlying component systems, enabling us to leverage SMT models based on arbitrary paradigms. We compare our approach with several related techniques, and demonstrate significant BLEU improvements in large-scale Chinese-to-English translation tasks.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tianjin University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Nan Duan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duan:Nan", "Mu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mu", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming"], "pages": 10}
