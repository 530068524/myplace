For the former, deep learning using backpropagation has recently achieved a string of successes across many domains and datasets. For the latter, neuromorphic chips that run spiking neural networks have recently achieved unprecedented energy efficiency. To bring these two advances together, we must first resolve the incompatibility between backpropagation, which uses continuous-output neurons and synaptic weights, and neuromorphic designs, which employ spiking neurons and discrete synapses. Our approach is to treat spikes and discrete synapses as continuous probabilities, which allows training the network using standard backpropagation. The trained network naturally maps to neuromorphic hardware by sampling the probabilities to create one or more networks, which are merged using ensemble averaging. To demonstrate, we trained a sparsely connected network that runs on the TrueNorth chip using the MNIST dataset. With a high performance network (ensemble of 64), we achieve 99.42% accuracy at 108 \u03bcJ per image, and with a high efficiency network (ensemble of 1) we achieve 92.7% accuracy at 0.268 \u03bcJ per image.", "citation": "Citations (276)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Steven K.
