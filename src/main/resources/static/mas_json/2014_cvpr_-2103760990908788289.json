In this paper, we study a motion segmentation-free dynamic scene deblurring method, which is unlike other conventional methods. When the motion can be approximated to linear motion that is locally (pixel-wise) varying, we can handle various types of blur caused by camera shake, including out-of-plane motion, depth variation, radial distortion, and so on. Thus, we propose a new energy model simultaneously estimating motion flow and the latent image based on robust total variation (TV)-L1 model. This approach is necessary to handle abrupt changes in motion without segmentation. Furthermore, we address the problem of the traditional coarse-to-fine deblurring framework, which gives rise to artifacts when restoring small structures with distinct motion. We thus propose a novel kernel re-initialization method which reduces the error of motion flow propagated from a coarser level. Moreover, a highly effective convex optimization-based solution mitigating the computational difficulties of the TV-L1 model is established. Comparative experimental results on challenging real blurry images demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tae Hyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0006:Tae_Hyun", "Kyoung Mu Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kyoung_Mu"], "pages": 8}
