We cast isometric embedding as MRF optimization and apply efficient global optimization algorithms based on linear programming relaxations. The Markov random field perspective suggests a natural connection with robust statistics and motivates robust forms of the intrinsic distortion functional. Our approach outperforms a large body of prior work by a significant margin, increasing registration precision on real data by a factor of 3.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Qifeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Qifeng", "Vladlen Koltun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koltun:Vladlen"], "pages": 9}
