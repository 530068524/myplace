However, these systems may produce huge amounts of information that must be efficiently propagated to a group of people or even large communities while still protecting the privacy of the participants.   We argue that both scalability and privacy can be ensured by delaying context propagation until certain conditions are met and then aggregating such messages both at the syntactic and semantic level. Since such conditions vary from application to application, we propose Radiator, a systematic way to model the propagation characteristics of a distributed context-aware system.   Our qualitative evaluation shows that Radiator is generic enough to model the needs of different context propagation scenarios. To assess the impact of the model on the scalability of an application, we developed twiRadiator, an adaptation of Twitter to the Radiator model which, while preserving user expectations, reduces bandwidth consumption to approx. one third.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Technical University of Lisbon", "Technical University of Lisbon"], "authors": ["Pedro Alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alves:Pedro", "Paulo Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira_0001:Paulo"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
