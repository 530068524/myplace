This setup includes well-studied problems such as compressive sensing and low-rank matrix recovery. We show how to design more efficient algorithms for the union-of subspace recovery problem by using *approximate* projections. Instantiating our general framework for the low-rank matrix recovery problem gives the fastest provable running time for an algorithm with optimal sample complexity. Moreover, we give fast approximate projections for 2D histograms, another well-studied low-dimensional model of data. We complement our theoretical results with experiments demonstrating that our framework also leads to improved time and sample complexity empirically.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Chinmay Hegde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hegde:Chinmay", "Piotr Indyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Indyk:Piotr", "Ludwig Schmidt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidt:Ludwig"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
