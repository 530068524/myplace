{"title": "Improving the safety of homeless young people with mobile phones: values, form and function.", "fields": ["proposition", "intrinsic value", "stakeholder", "value sensitive design", "mobile phone"], "abstract": "By their pervasiveness and by being worn on our bodies, mobile phones seem to have become intrinsic to safety. To examine this proposition, 43 participants, from four stakeholder groups (homeless young people, service providers, police officers, and community members), were asked to consider how homeless young people could use mobile phones to keep safe. Participants were asked to express their knowledge for place-based safety and to envision how mobile phones might be used to improve safety. Detailed analysis of the resulting data, which included value sketches, written value scenarios, and semi-structured discussion, led to specific design opportunities, related to values (e.g., supporting trust and desire to help others), function (e.g., documenting harms for future purposes), and form (e.g., leveraging social expectations for how mobile phones can be used to influence behavior). Together, these findings bound a design space for how mobile phones can be used to manage unsafe situations.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Seattle Pacific University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jill Palzkill Woelfer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woelfer:Jill_Palzkill", "Amy Iverson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iverson:Amy", "David G.
