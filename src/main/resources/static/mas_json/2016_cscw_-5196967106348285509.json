{"title": "\"Thanks for your interest in our Facebook group, but it's only for dads: \" Social Roles of Stay-at-Home Dads.", "fields": ["role theory", "social media", "social support", "the internet", "social network"], "abstract": "The number of stay-at-home dads (SAHDs) in the U.S. has risen dramatically over the past 30 years. Despite gaining social acceptability, SAHDs still experience isolation and judgment in their offline environments. This research explores how SAHDs use the Internet and social media related to their roles as fathers. We conducted interviews with 18 SAHDs about their families, their identities, and their social experiences. We find that they turn to social media to gain social support and overcome isolation they experience offline. However, they engage in strategic self-disclosure on particular platforms to avoid judgment related to being SAHDs. They rely on online platforms to give off both traditionally feminine and masculine impressions\u00e2  as loving caregivers of their children while simultaneously as do-it-yourself men who make things around the house. Through creating Facebook groups and using anonymous social media sites, SAHDs create multidimensional social networks that allow them to cope better with the role change. We reflect on the evolving roles of SAHDs in society, and put forth an argument for greater support for diverse kinds of parenting online.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Tawfiq Ammari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ammari:Tawfiq", "Sarita Yardi Schoenebeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schoenebeck:Sarita_Yardi"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
