In this paper, we unify the l1,2 and l1,\u221e norms by considering a family of l1,q norms for 1 < q < \u221e and study the problem of determining the most appropriate sparsity enforcing norm to use in the context of multi-task feature selection. Using the generalized normal distribution, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of the general multi-task feature selection problem using the l1,q norm. Based on this probabilistic interpretation, we develop a probabilistic model using the noninformative Jeffreys prior. We also extend the model to learn and exploit more general types of pairwise relationships between tasks. For both versions of the model, we devise expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to learn all model parameters, including q, automatically. Experiments have been conducted on two cancer classification applications using microarray gene expression data.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Yu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Yu", "Dit-Yan Yeung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeung:Dit=Yan", "Qian Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Qian"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
