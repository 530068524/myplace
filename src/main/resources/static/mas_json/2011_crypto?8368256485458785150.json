{"title": "Smaller Decoding Exponents: Ball-Collision Decoding.", "fields": ["post quantum cryptography", "niederreiter cryptosystem", "list decoding", "linear code", "mceliece cryptosystem"], "abstract": "Very few public-key cryptosystems are known that can encrypt and decrypt in time b2+o(1) with conjectured security level 2b against conventional computers and quantum computers. The oldest of these systems is the classic McEliece code-based cryptosystem.\n\nThe best attacks known against this system are generic decoding attacks that treat McEliece's hidden binary Goppa codes as random linear codes. A standard conjecture is that the best possible w-error-decoding attacks against random linear codes of dimension k and length n take time 2(\u03b1(R, W)+o(1))n if k/n \u2192 R and w/n \u2192 W as n \u2192 \u221e.\n\nBefore this paper, the best upper bound known on the exponent \u03b1(R, W) was the exponent of an attack introduced by Stern in 1989. This paper introduces \"ball-collision decoding\" and shows that it has a smaller exponent for each (R, W): the speedup from Stern's algorithm to ball-collision decoding is exponential in n.", "citation": "Citations (133)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "authors": ["Daniel J.
