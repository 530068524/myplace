{"title": "Revenue Optimization with Approximate Bid Predictions.", "fields": ["reservation price", "actuarial science", "learning community", "common value auction", "revenue"], "abstract": "In the context of advertising auctions, finding good reserve prices is a notoriously challenging learning problem. This is due to the heterogeneity of ad opportunity types, and the non-convexity of the objective function. In this work, we show how to reduce reserve price optimization to the standard setting of prediction under squared loss, a well understood problem in the learning community. We further bound the gap between the expected bid and revenue in terms of the average loss of the predictor. This is the first result that formally relates the revenue gained to the quality of a standard machine learned model.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["New York University", "Google"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Andres Mu\u00f1oz Medina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medina:Andres_Mu=ntilde=oz", "Sergei Vassilvitskii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vassilvitskii:Sergei"], "pages": 9}
