In contrast to existing anatomically-based methods, we propose a novel multi-subject algorithm that derives a functional correspondence by aligning spatial patterns of functional connectivity across a set of subjects. We test our method on fMRI data collected during a movie viewing experiment. By cross-validating the results of our algorithm, we show that the correspondence successfully generalizes to a secondary movie dataset not used to derive the alignment.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Dartmouth College", "Department of E ... al Engineering", "Department of E ... al Engineering"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Bryan R.
