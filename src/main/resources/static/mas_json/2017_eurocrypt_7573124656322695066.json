{"title": "Amortized Complexity of Zero-Knowledge Proofs Revisited: Achieving Linear Soundness Slack.", "fields": ["random oracle", "security parameter", "amortized analysis", "mathematics", "zero knowledge proof", "discrete mathematics", "soundness", "commitment scheme"], "abstract": "We propose a new zero-knowledge protocol for proving knowledge of short preimages under additively homomorphic functions that map integer vectors to an Abelian group. The protocol achieves amortized efficiency in that it only needs to send O(n) function values to prove knowledge of n preimages. Furthermore we significantly improve previous bounds on how short a secret we can extract from a dishonest prover, namely our bound is a factor O(k) larger than the size of secret used by the honest prover, where k is the statistical security parameter. In the best previous result, the factor was \\(O(k^{\\log k} n)\\).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Leiden University", "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "Aarhus University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Ronald Cramer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cramer:Ronald", "Ivan Damg\u00e5rd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damg=aring=rd:Ivan", "Chaoping Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Chaoping", "Chen Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Chen"], "pages": 22}
