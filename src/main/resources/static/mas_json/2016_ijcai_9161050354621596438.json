{"title": "MATHCHECK: A Math Assistant via a Combination of Computer Algebra Systems and SAT Solvers.", "fields": ["inner loop", "counterexample", "conjecture", "boolean satisfiability problem", "lemma"], "abstract": "We present a method and an associated system, called MATHCHECK, that embeds the functionality of a computer algebra system (CAS) within the inner loop of a conflict-driven clause-learning SAT solver. SAT+CAS systems, a la MATHCHECK, can be used as an assistant by mathematicians to either counterexample or finitely verify open universal conjectures on any mathematical topic (e.g., graph and number theory, algebra, geometry, etc.) supported by the underlying CAS system. Such a SAT+CAS system combines the efficient search routines of modern SAT solvers, with the expressive power of CAS, thus complementing both. The key insight behind the power of the SAT+CAS combination is that the CAS system can help cut down the search-space of the SAT solver, by providing learned clauses that encode theory-specific lemmas, as it searches for a counterexample to the input conjecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a long-standing open conjecture regarding matchings of hypercubes.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Edward Zulkoski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zulkoski:Edward", "Vijay Ganesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganesh:Vijay", "Krzysztof Czarnecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czarnecki:Krzysztof"], "pages": 6}
