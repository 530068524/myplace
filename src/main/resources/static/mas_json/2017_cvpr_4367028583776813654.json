{"title": "Combining Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Smoothness Cues for Weakly Supervised Image Segmentation.", "fields": ["segmentation based object categorization", "problem statement", "probabilistic logic", "conditional random field", "scale space segmentation"], "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of weakly supervised semantic image segmentation. Our goal is to label every pixel in a new image, given only image-level object labels associated with training images. Our problem statement differs from common semantic segmentation, where pixel-wise annotations are typically assumed available in training. We specify a novel deep architecture which fuses three distinct computation processes toward semantic segmentation \u2013 namely, (i) the bottom-up computation of neural activations in a CNN for the image-level prediction of object classes, (ii) the top-down estimation of conditional likelihoods of the CNNs activations given the predicted objects, resulting in probabilistic attention maps per object class, and (iii) the lateral attention-message passing from neighboring neurons at the same CNN layer. The fusion of (i)-(iii) is realized via a conditional random field as recurrent network aimed at generating a smooth and boundary-preserving segmentation. Unlike existing work, we formulate a unified end-to-end learning of all components of our deep architecture. Evaluation on the benchmark PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrates that we outperform reasonable weakly supervised baselines and state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Anirban Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Anirban", "Sinisa Todorovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Todorovic:Sinisa"], "pages": 10}
