{"title": "Efficient Context-Free Grammar Constraints.", "fields": ["unrestricted grammar", "grammar systems theory", "regular tree grammar", "deterministic context free grammar", "adaptive grammar"], "abstract": "With the introduction of constraints based on finite automata a new line of research has opened where constraints are based on formal languages. Recently, constraints based on grammars higher up in the Chomsky hierarchy were introduced. We devise a time- and space-efficient incremental arc-consistency algorithm for context-free grammars. Particularly, we show how to filter a sequence of monotonically tightening problems in cubic time and quadratic space. Experiments on a scheduling problem show orders of magnitude improvements in time and space consumption.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University"], "authors": ["Serdar Kadioglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kadioglu:Serdar", "Meinolf Sellmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sellmann:Meinolf"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 7}
