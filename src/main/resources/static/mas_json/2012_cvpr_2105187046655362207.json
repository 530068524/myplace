Our model is based on a mixtures of trees with a shared pool of parts; we model every facial landmark as a part and use global mixtures to capture topological changes due to viewpoint. We show that tree-structured models are surprisingly effective at capturing global elastic deformation, while being easy to optimize unlike dense graph structures. We present extensive results on standard face benchmarks, as well as a new \u201cin the wild\u201d annotated dataset, that suggests our system advances the state-of-the-art, sometimes considerably, for all three tasks. Though our model is modestly trained with hundreds of faces, it compares favorably to commercial systems trained with billions of examples (such as Google Picasa and face.com).", "citation": "Citations (1,701)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xiangxin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Xiangxin", "Deva Ramanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanan:Deva"], "pages": 8}
