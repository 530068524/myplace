RiTHM takes a C program under inspection and a set of LTL properties as input and generates an instrumented C program that is verified at run time by a time-triggered monitor. RiTHM provides two techniques based on static analysis and control theory to minimize instrumentation of the input C program and monitoring intervention. The monitor's verification decision procedure is sound and complete and exploits the GPU many-core technology to speedup and encapsulate monitoring tasks.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Samaneh Navabpour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navabpour:Samaneh", "Yogi Joshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joshi:Yogi", "Chun Wah Wallace Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Chun_Wah_Wallace", "Shay Berkovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berkovich:Shay", "Ramy Medhat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medhat:Ramy", "Borzoo Bonakdarpour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonakdarpour:Borzoo", "Sebastian Fischmeister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischmeister:Sebastian"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
