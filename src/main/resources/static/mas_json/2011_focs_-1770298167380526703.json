We initiate the study of testing and local reconstruction of the Lipschitz property of functions. A property tester has to distinguish functions with the property (in this case, Lipschitz) from functions that differ from every function with the property on many values. A local filter reconstructs a desired property (in this case, Lipschitz) in the following sense: given an arbitrary function $f$ and a query $x$, it returns $g(x)$, where the resulting function $g$ satisfies the property, changing $f$ only when necessary. If $f$ has the property, $g$ must be equal to $f$. We design efficient testers and local reconstructors for functions over domains of the form $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}^d$, equipped with $\\ell_1$ distance, and give corresponding impossibility results. The algorithms we design have applications to program analysis...", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Madhav Jha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jha:Madhav", "Sofya Raskhodnikova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raskhodnikova:Sofya"], "pages": 10}
