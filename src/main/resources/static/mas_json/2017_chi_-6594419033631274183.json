{"title": "Online Feedback Exchange: A Framework for Understanding the Socio-Psychological Factors.", "fields": ["extant taxon", "crowdsourcing", "online participation", "learning sciences", "organizational behavior"], "abstract": "To meet the demand for authentic, timely, and affordable feedback, researchers have explored technologies to connect designers with feedback providers online. While researchers have implemented mechanisms to improve the content of feedback, most systems for online feedback exchange do not support an end-to-end cycle, from help-seeking to sense-making to action. Building on extant literature in learning sciences, design, organizational behavior, and online communities, we propose a conceptual framework to highlight critical processes that affect online feedback exchange. We contribute research questions for future feedback systems and argue that online feedback systems must be able to support designers through five activities that happen before, during, and after the feedback exchange. Our framework suggests that systems should address broader socio-psychological factors, such as how intent should be communicated online, how dialogue can support the interpretation of feedback, and how to balance the tradeoffs of anonymizing feedback providers.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "University of California, San Diego", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Northwestern University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Eureka Foong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foong:Eureka", "Steven P.
