In particular, because of this heterogeneity, the capacity to store, track, and query provenance data is becoming a pivotal feature of modern triple stores. In this paper, we tackle the problem of efficiently executing provenance-enabled queries over RDF data. We propose, implement and empirically evaluate five different query execution strategies for RDF queries that incorporate knowledge of provenance. The evaluation is conducted on Web Data obtained from two different Web crawls (The Billion Triple Challenge, and the Web Data Commons). Our evaluation shows that using an adaptive query materialization execution strategy performs best in our context. Interestingly, we find that because provenance is prevalent within Web Data and is highly selective, it can be used to improve query processing performance. This is a counterintuitive result as provenance is often associated with additional overhead.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Fribourg", "University of Fribourg", "Elsevier"], "authors": ["Marcin Wylot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wylot:Marcin", "Philippe Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cudr=eacute==Mauroux:Philippe", "Paul T.
