Recommendations for each code location are typically computed independently of the other locations. We propose that an IDE should consider the whole codebase, not just the local context, before offering recommendations for a particular location. We demonstrate the potential benefits of our technique by presenting four concrete scenarios in which the Eclipse IDE fails to provide proper Quick Fixes at relevant locations, even though it offers those fixes at other locations. We describe a technique that can augment an existing IDE\u2019s recommendations to account for non-local information. For example, when some compilation errors depend on others, our technique helps the developer decide which errors to resolve first.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Waterloo", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Kivan\u00e7 Muslu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muslu:Kivan=ccedil=", "Yuriy Brun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brun:Yuriy", "Reid Holmes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holmes:Reid", "Michael D.
