The extension is to limit the number of drivers that any store should see during the fixed period. We name this constraint as limited visiting quota (LVQ). We devise a new method to solve this problem. Our experimental results indicate that our method is able to reduce the number of vehicles used by 23% and thus bring substantial savings to our client. The solver has been integrated into an existing vehicle routing product called VROOM for the daily usage of our client.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["South China University of Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Red Jasper Limi ... ies, Hong Kong", "Red Jasper Limi ... ies, Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Jianfeng Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jianfeng", "Wenbin Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Wenbin", "Chan Hou Che.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Che:Chan_Hou", "Andrew Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Andrew"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 6}
