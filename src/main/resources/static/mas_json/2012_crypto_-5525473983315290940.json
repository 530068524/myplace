In particular, our scheme can be safely deployed in unknown settings in which no a-priori bound on the number of encryptions and/or users is known.\n\nAs a central technical building block, we construct the first structure-preserving signature scheme with a tight security reduction. This signature scheme may be of independent interest. Combining this scheme with Groth-Sahai proofs yields a tightly simulation-sound non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system for group equations. If we use this proof system in the Naor-Yung double encryption scheme, we obtain a tightly IND-CCA secure public-key encryption scheme from the Decision Linear assumption.\n\nWe point out that our techniques are not specific to public-key encryption security. Rather, we view our signature scheme and proof system as general building blocks that can help to achieve a tight security reduction.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Ruhr University Bochum"], "authors": ["Dennis Hofheinz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofheinz:Dennis", "Tibor Jager.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jager:Tibor"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 18}
