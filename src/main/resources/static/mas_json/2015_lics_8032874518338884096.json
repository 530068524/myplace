If the underlying calculus becomes probabilistic, however, equivalence is too discriminating: terms which have totally unrelated behaviours are treated the same as terms which behave very similarly. We study the problem of evaluating the distance between affine a#x03BB;-terms. A natural generalisation of context equiv-alence, is shown to be characterised by a notion of trace distance, and to be bounded from above by a co inductively defined distance based on the Kantorovich metric on distributions. A different, again fully-abstract, tuple-based notion of trace distance is shown to be able to handle nontrivial examples.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Paris Diderot University", "University of Bologna"], "authors": ["Rapha\u00eblle Crubill\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crubill=eacute=:Rapha=euml=lle", "Ugo Dal Lago.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lago:Ugo_Dal"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
