We develop the first online version of SFA, via a combination of incremental Principal Components Analysis and Minor Components Analysis. Unlike standard batch-based SFA, online SFA adapts along with non-stationary environments, which makes it a generally useful unsupervised preprocessor for autonomous learning agents. We compare online SFA to batch SFA in several experiments and show that it indeed learns without a teacher to encode the input stream by informative slow features representing meaningful abstract environmental properties. We extend online SFA to deep networks in hierarchical fashion, and use them to successfully extract abstract object position information from high-dimensional video.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Varun Raj Kompella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kompella:Varun_Raj", "Matthew D.
