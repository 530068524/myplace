{"title": "Preference preserving hashing for efficient recommendation.", "fields": ["feature hashing", "dynamic perfect hashing", "locality sensitive hashing", "universal hashing", "2 choice hashing"], "abstract": "Recommender systems usually need to compare a large number of items before users' most preferred ones can be found This process can be very costly if recommendations are frequently made on large scale datasets. In this paper, a novel hashing algorithm, named Preference Preserving Hashing (PPH), is proposed to speed up recommendation. Hashing has been widely utilized in large scale similarity search (e.g. similar image search), and the search speed with binary hashing code is significantly faster than that with real-valued features. However, one challenge of applying hashing to recommendation is that, recommendation concerns users' preferences over items rather than their similarities. To address this challenge, PPH contains two novel components that work with the popular matrix factorization (MF) algorithm. In MF, users' preferences over items are calculated as the inner product between the learned real-valued user/item features. The first component of PPH constrains the learning process, so that users' preferences can be well approximated by user-item similarities. The second component, which is a novel quantization algorithm,generates the binary hashing code from the learned real-valued user/item features. Finally, recommendation can be achieved efficiently via fast hashing code search. Experiments on three real world datasets show that the recommendation speed of the proposed PPH algorithm can be hundreds of times faster than original MF with real-valued features, and the recommendation accuracy is significantly better than previous work of hashing for recommendation.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Zhiwei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhiwei", "Qifan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qifan", "Lingyun Ruan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruan:Lingyun", "Luo Si.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Si:Luo"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
