{"title": "Threader: A Constraint-Based Verifier for Multi-threaded Programs.", "fields": ["horn clause", "abstraction", "mathematical proof", "programming language", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "We present a tool that implements Owicki-Gries and relyguarantee methods for the compositional verification of multithreaded programs. Our tool computes the requisite auxiliary assertions automatically using an abstraction and refinement procedure. Our procedure is based on a Horn clause encoding of refinement queries and facilitates the discovery of thread-modular proofs when such proofs exist. We present the tool and its evaluation on a collection of benchmarks, including a direct comparison of the effectiveness of the proof rules.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ashutosh Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Ashutosh", "Corneliu Popeea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popeea:Corneliu", "Andrey Rybalchenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rybalchenko:Andrey"], "pages": 6}
