This paper introduces two new improvements to CBS and incorporates them into a coherent, improved version of CBS, namely ICBS. Experimental results show that each of these improvements further reduces the runtime over the existing CBS-based approaches. When all improvements are combined, an even larger improvement is achieved, producing state-of-the art results for a number of domains.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Eli Boyarski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boyarski:Eli", "Ariel Felner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felner:Ariel", "Roni Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Roni", "Guni Sharon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharon:Guni", "David Tolpin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tolpin:David", "Oded Betzalel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Betzalel:Oded", "Solomon Eyal Shimony.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimony:Solomon_Eyal"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
