{"title": "GaitAssist: a daily-life support and training system for parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait.", "fields": ["frost", "life support", "parkinson s disease", "training system", "gait"], "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease often experience freezing of gait, which bears a high risk of falling, a prevalent cause for morbidity and mortality. In this work we present GaitAssist, a wearable system for freezing of gait support in daily life. The system provides real-time auditory cueing after the onset of freezing episodes. Furthermore, GaitAssist implements training exercises to learn how to handle freezing situations. GaitAssist is the result of a design process where we considered the input of engineers, clinicians and 18 Parkinson's disease patients, in order to find an optimal trade-off between system wearability and performance. We tested the final system in a user study with 5 additional patients. They reported a reduction in the freezing of gait duration as a result of the auditory stimulation provided, and that they feel the system enhanced their confidence during walking.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Sinziana Mazilu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazilu:Sinziana", "Ulf Blanke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blanke:Ulf", "Michael Hardegger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardegger:Michael", "Gerhard Tr\u00f6ster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tr=ouml=ster:Gerhard", "Eran Gazit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gazit:Eran", "Jeffrey M.
