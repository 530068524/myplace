{"title": "Projection-Free Online Optimization with Stochastic Gradient: From Convexity to Submodularity.", "fields": ["regular polygon", "maximization", "regret", "convexity", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "Online optimization has been a successful framework for solving large-scale problems under computational constraints and partial information. Current methods for online convex optimization require either a projection or exact gradient computation at each step, both of which can be prohibitively expensive for large-scale applications. At the same time, there is a growing trend of non-convex optimization in machine learning community and a need for online methods. Continuous submodular functions, which exhibit a natural diminishing returns condition, have recently been proposed as a broad class of non-convex functions which may be efficiently optimized. Although online methods have been introduced, they suffer from similar problems. In this work, we propose Meta-Frank-Wolfe, the first online projectionfree algorithm that uses stochastic gradient estimates. The algorithm relies on a careful sampling of gradients in each round and achieves the optimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ adversarial regret bounds for convex and continuous submodular optimization. We also propose One-Shot Frank-Wolfe, a simpler algorithm which requires only a single stochastic gradient estimate in each round and achieves a $O(T^{2/3})$ stochastic regret bound for convex and continuous submodular optimization. We apply our methods to develop a novel \"lifting\" framework for the online discrete submodular maximization and also see that they outperform current state of the art techniques on an extensive set of experiments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University", "University of Pennsylvania", "Yale University"], "authors": ["Lin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lin", "Christopher Harshaw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harshaw:Christopher", "Hamed Hassani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hassani:Hamed", "Amin Karbasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karbasi:Amin"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
