However, most approaches are limited by the fact that the desired functionality must be represented as a boolean circuit. In response, random-access machines (RAM programs) have recently been investigated as a promising alternative representation.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "Oregon State University", "Yahoo!", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Arash Afshar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Afshar:Arash", "Zhangxiang Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Zhangxiang", "Payman Mohassel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohassel:Payman", "Mike Rosulek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosulek:Mike"], "pages": 28}
