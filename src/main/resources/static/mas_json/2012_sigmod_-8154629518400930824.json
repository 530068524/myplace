{"title": "A highway-centric labeling approach for answering distance queries on large sparse graphs.", "fields": ["bounded function", "dense graph", "link analysis", "ranging", "set cover problem"], "abstract": "The distance query, which asks the length of the shortest path from a vertex $u$ to another vertex  v , has applications ranging from link analysis, semantic web and other ontology processing, to social network operations. Here, we propose a novel labeling scheme, referred to as  Highway-Centric Labeling , for answering distance queries in a large sparse graph. It empowers the distance labeling with a highway structure and leverages a novel bipartite set cover framework/algorithm. Highway-centric labeling provides better labeling size than the state-of-the-art $2$-hop labeling, theoretically and empirically. It also offers both exact distance and approximate distance with bounded accuracy. A detailed experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that highway-centric labeling can outperform the state-of-the-art distance computation approaches in terms of both index size and query time.", "citation": "Citations (75)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Kent State University", "Kent State University", "Ohio State University", "Kent State University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ruoming Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Ruoming", "Ning Ruan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruan:Ning", "Yang Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Yang", "Victor E.
