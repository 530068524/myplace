Among these contents, video sharing is a challenging task due to the demand on a large amount of uplink bandwidth at the dedicated server. We leverage a P2P paradigm to alleviate the server to distribute shared videos. By investigating traces obtained from a popular online social network in China, we observe that users' preferences can be predicted. We design a user preference guided prefetching strategy to reduce video startup delays, enabling smooth playback. Simulation experiments show that our design achieves high prefetch accuracy and short startup delay with conservative storage and bandwidth capacities at peers.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Zhi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Zhi", "Lifeng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Lifeng", "Shiqiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shiqiang", "Wenwu Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Wenwu"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
