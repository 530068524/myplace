{"title": "On the challenges of building a web-based ubiquitous application platform.", "fields": ["immersion", "user experience design", "scalability", "software portability", "web application"], "abstract": "People use an increasing number of consumer electronic devices to access their mobile apps. To enhance the applications' immersive user experience, these devices often expose APIs for accessing a wide array of sensors and domain-specific capabilities. Existing mobile application environments, however, only provide limited support for cross-device access of such APIs. To address this limitation, the Webinos platform was designed. Webinos is a virtualized Web-based application platform, aiming to support the collaboration of multiple devices within a single mobile application. In this paper we elaborate on the Webinos platform design. We discuss the encountered design challenges regarding portability, scalability, and privacy, and how these were mitigated.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Ghent University", "University of Oxford", "Ghent University", "BMW Forschung und Technik"], "authors": ["Heiko Desruelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desruelle:Heiko", "John Lyle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyle:John", "Simon Isenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isenberg:Simon", "Frank Gielen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gielen:Frank"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
