In the case of software plagiarism, emerging obfuscation techniques have made automated detection increasingly difficult. In this paper, we propose a binary-oriented, obfuscation-resilient method based on a new concept, longest common subsequence of semantically equivalent basic blocks, which combines rigorous program semantics with longest common subsequence based fuzzy matching. We model the semantics of a basic block by a set of symbolic formulas representing the input-output relations of the block. This way, the semantics equivalence (and similarity) of two blocks can be checked by a theorem prover. We then model the semantics similarity of two paths using the longest common subsequence with basic blocks as elements. This novel combination has resulted in strong resiliency to code obfuscation. We have developed a prototype and our experimental results show that our method is effective and practical when applied to real-world software.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Lannan Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Lannan", "Jiang Ming.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ming_0002:Jiang", "Dinghao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Dinghao", "Peng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Peng", "Sencun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Sencun"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
