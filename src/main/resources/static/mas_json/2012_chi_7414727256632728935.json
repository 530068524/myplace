As a possible method for decreasing rates of obesity, we focused on controlling food intake implicitly without any effort.   We hypothesized that ambiguous perception of satiety can be applied to control our food intake. Recent psychological studies have revealed that the amount of food consumed is influenced by both its actual volume and external factors during eating. Based on this knowledge, we sought to control perception of satiety gained from the same amount of food by changing its apparent size. We also proposed a method for food-volume augmentation using real-time shape deformation. Our results suggest that this augmentation can control the perception of satiety and food intake.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Takuji Narumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narumi:Takuji", "Yuki Ban.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ban:Yuki", "Takashi Kajinami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kajinami:Takashi", "Tomohiro Tanikawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanikawa:Tomohiro", "Michitaka Hirose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirose:Michitaka"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
