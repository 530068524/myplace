Existing studies of full-duplex mainly focused on its PHY layer design, which enables bidirectional transmission between a single pair of nodes. In this paper, we establish an analytical framework to quantify the network-level capacity gain of full-duplex over halfduplex. Our analysis reveals that inter-link interference and spatial reuse substantially reduces full-duplex gain, rendering it well below 2 in common cases. More remarkably, the asymptotic gain approaches 1 when interference range approaches transmission range. Through a comparison between optimal halfand fullduplex MAC algorithms, we find that full-duplex\u2019s gain is further reduced when it is applied to CSMA based wireless networks. Our analysis provides important guidelines for designing full-duplex networks. In particular, network-level mechanisms such as spatial reuse and asynchronous contention must be carefully addressed in full-duplex based protocols, in order to translate full-duplex\u2019s PHY layer capacity gain into network throughput improvement.", "citation": "Citations (120)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Xiufeng Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Xiufeng", "Xinyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xinyu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
