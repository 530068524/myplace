{"title": "Goal Recognition with Variable-Order Markov Models.", "fields": ["ranking", "machine learning", "software", "artificial intelligence", "markov model"], "abstract": "The recognition of the goal a user is pursing when interacting with a software application is a crucial task for an interface agent as it serves as a context for making opportune interventions to provide assistance to the user. The prediction of the user goal must be fast and a goal recognizer must be able to make early predictions with few observations of the user actions. In this work we propose an approach to automatically build an intention model from a plan corpus using Variable Order Markov models. We claim that following our approach, an interface agent will be capable of accurately ranking the most probable user goals in a time linear to the number of goals modeled.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["ISISTAN Researc ... cas, Argentina", "ISISTAN Researc ... cas, Argentina"], "authors": ["Marcelo Armentano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Armentano:Marcelo", "Anal\u00eda Amandi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amandi:Anal=iacute=a"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
