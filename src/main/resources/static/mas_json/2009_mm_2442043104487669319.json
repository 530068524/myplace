In this paper, we present a framework for cross-media retrieval, where the query example and the retrieved result(s) can be of different media types. We first construct Multimedia Correlation Space (MMCS) by exploring the semantic correlation of different multimedia modalities, during which multimedia content and co-occurrence information is utilized. We propose a novel ranking algorithm, namely ranking with Local Regression and Global Alignment (LRGA), which learns a robust Laplacian matrix for data ranking. In LRGA, for each data point, a local linear regression model is used to predict the ranking values of its neighboring points. We propose a unified objective function to globally align the local models from all the data points so that an optimal ranking value can be assigned to each data point. LRGA is insensitive to parameters, making it particularly suitable for data ranking. A relevance feedback algorithm is proposed to improve the retrieval performance. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.", "citation": "Citations (181)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "University of Rochester", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Yi", "Dong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Dong", "Feiping Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Feiping", "Jiebo Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Jiebo", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
