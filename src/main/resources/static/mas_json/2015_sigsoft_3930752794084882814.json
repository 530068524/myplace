{"title": "Responsive designs in a snap.", "fields": ["snap", "software design pattern", "design space exploration", "mobile device", "combinatorial explosion"], "abstract": "With the massive adoption of mobile devices with different form- factors, UI designers face the challenge of designing responsive UIs which are visually appealing across a wide range of devices. De- signing responsive UIs requires a deep knowledge of HTML/CSS as well as responsive patterns - juggling through various design configurations and re-designing for multiple devices is laborious and time-consuming. We present DECOR, a recommendation tool for creating multi-device responsive UIs. Given an initial UI de- sign, user-specified design constraints and a list of devices, DECOR provides ranked, device-specific recommendations to the designer for approval. Design space exploration involves a combinatorial explosion: we formulate it as a design repair problem and devise several design space pruning techniques to enable efficient repair. An evaluation over real-life designs shows that DECOR is able to compute the desired recommendations, involving a variety of responsive design patterns, in less than a minute.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["IBM", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Nishant Sinha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinha_0001:Nishant", "Rezwana Karim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karim:Rezwana"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
