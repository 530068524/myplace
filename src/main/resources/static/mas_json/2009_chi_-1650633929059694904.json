Therefore, careful design of mobile service notification is needed. In this paper we evaluate two types of audio (auditory icons and earcons) as mobile service notifications, by comparing them on 4 measures: intuitiveness, learnability, memorability and user preference. A 4-stage longitudinal evaluation involving two lab experiments, a field study and a web-based experiment indicated that auditory icons performed significantly better in all measures. Implications for mobile audio notification design are presented.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Bath", "University of Bath", "University of Bristol", "University of Bath"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Stavros Garzonis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garzonis:Stavros", "Simon L.
