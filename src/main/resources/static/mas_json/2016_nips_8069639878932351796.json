Towards this goal, we propose a clustering based regularization that encourages parsimonious representations. Our k-means style objective is easy to optimize and flexible supporting various forms of clustering, including sample and spatial clustering as well as co-clustering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the tasks of unsupervised learning, classification, fine grained categorization and zero-shot learning.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Renjie Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Renjie", "Alexander G.
