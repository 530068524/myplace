Scalability however remains a major challenge for symbolic execution. Compositional analysis is a well-known general purpose methodology for increasing scalability. This paper introduces a new approach for  compositional symbolic execution.  Our key insight is that we can summarize each analyzed method as a  memoization tree  that captures the crucial elements of symbolic execution, and leverage these memoization trees to efficiently  replay  the symbolic execution of the corresponding methods with respect to their calling contexts. Memoization trees offer a natural way to compose in the presence of heap operations, which cannot be dealt with by previous work that uses logical formulas as summaries for compositional symbolic execution. Our approach also enables efficient target oriented symbolic execution for error detection or program coverage. Initial experimental evaluation based on a prototype implementation in Symbolic PathFinder shows that our approach can be up to an order of magnitude faster than traditional non-compositional symbolic execution.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Texas State University", "Ames Research Center", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Rui Qiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qiu:Rui", "Guowei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Guowei", "Corina S.
