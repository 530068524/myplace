{"title": "CPM: Adaptive Video-on-Demand with Cooperative Peer Assists and Multicast.", "fields": ["codebase", "unicast", "multicast", "continuous phase modulation", "peer to peer"], "abstract": "We present CPM, a unified approach that exploits server multicast, assisted by peer downloads, to provide efficient video-on-demand (VoD) in a service provider environment. We describe our architecture and show how CPM is designed to dynamically adapt to a wide range of situations including highly different peer-upload bandwidths, content popularity, user request arrival patterns, video library size, and subscriber population. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CPM using simulations (based on an actual implementation codebase) across the range of situations described above and show that CPM does significantly better than traditional unicast, different forms of multicast, as well as peer-to-peer schemes. Along with synthetic parameters, we augment our experiments using data from a deployed VoD service to evaluate the performance of CPM.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Vijay Gopalakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalakrishnan:Vijay", "Samrat Bhattacharjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhattacharjee:Samrat", "K.
