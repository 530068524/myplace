ChronoStream treats internal state as a first-class citizen and aims at providing flexible elastic support in both vertical and horizontal dimensions to cope with workload fluctuation and dynamic resource reclamation. With a clear separation between application-level computation parallelism and OS-level execution concurrency, ChronoStream enables transparent dynamic scaling and failure recovery by eliminating any network I/O and state-synchronization overhead. Our evaluation on dozens of computing nodes shows that ChronoStream can scale linearly and achieve transparent elasticity and high availability without sacrificing system performance or affecting collocated tenants.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yingjun Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yingjun", "Kian-Lee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian=Lee"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
