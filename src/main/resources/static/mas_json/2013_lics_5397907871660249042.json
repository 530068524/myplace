{"title": "Dynamic Logic of Propositional Assignments: A Well-Behaved Variant of PDL.", "fields": ["well formed formula", "resolution", "autoepistemic logic", "zeroth order logic", "propositional variable"], "abstract": "We study a version of Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) that we call Dynamic Logic of Propositional Assignments (DL-PA). The atomic programs of DL-PA are assignments of propositional variables to true or to false. We show that DL-PA behaves better than PDL, having e.g. compactness and eliminability of the Kleene star. We establish tight complexity results: both satisfiability and model checking are EXPTIME-complete.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["IRIT, Univ. de  ... oulouse, France", "IRIT, Univ. de  ... oulouse, France", "LOA, ISTC, Trento, Italy"], "authors": ["Philippe Balbiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balbiani:Philippe", "Andreas Herzig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herzig:Andreas", "Nicolas Troquard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Troquard:Nicolas"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
