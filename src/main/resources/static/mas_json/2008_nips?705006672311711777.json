In this paper, we extend the theory of CS to include signals that are concisely represented in terms of a graphical model. In particular, we use Markov Random Fields (MRFs) to represent sparse signals whose nonzero coefficients are clustered. Our new model-based recovery algorithm, dubbed Lattice Matching Pursuit (LaMP), stably recovers MRF-modeled signals using many fewer measurements and computations than the current state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (189)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University", "Rice University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Volkan Cevher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cevher:Volkan", "Marco F.
