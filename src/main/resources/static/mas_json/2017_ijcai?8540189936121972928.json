We describe an intuitionistic substructural logic that gives an account of layering. As in bunched systems, the logic includes the usual intuitionistic connectives, together with a non-commutative, non-associative conjunction used to capture layering and its associated implications. We give soundness and completeness theorems for labelled tableaux and Hilbert-type systems with respect to a Kripke semantics on graphs. To demonstrate the utility of the logic, we show how to represent a range of systems and security examples, illuminating the relationship between services/policies and the infrastructures/architectures to which they are applied.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Simon Docherty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Docherty:Simon", "David J.
