{"title": "Tiree Energy Pulse: Exploring Renewable Energy Forecasts on the Edge of the Grid.", "fields": ["feed in tariff", "mains electricity", "software deployment", "incentive", "renewable energy credit"], "abstract": "In many parts of the world, the electricity supply industry makes the task of dealing with unpredictable spikes and dips in production and demand invisible to consumers, maintaining a seemingly unlimited supply. A future increase in reliance on time-variable renewable sources of electricity may lead to greater fluctuations in supply. We engaged remote islanders as equal partners in a research project that investigated through technology-mediated enquiry the topic of synchronising energy consumption with supply, and together built a prototype renewable energy forecast display. A number of participants described a change in their practices, saving high energy tasks for times when local renewable energy was expected to be available, despite having no financial incentive to do so. The main contributions of this paper are in: 1) the results of co-development sessions exploring systems supporting synchronising consumption with supply and 2) the findings arising from the deployment of the prototype.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["William Simm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simm:William", "Maria Angela Ferrario.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferrario:Maria_Angela", "Adrian Friday.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friday:Adrian", "Peter Newman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Newman:Peter", "Stephen Forshaw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forshaw:Stephen", "Mike Hazas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazas:Mike", "Alan J.
