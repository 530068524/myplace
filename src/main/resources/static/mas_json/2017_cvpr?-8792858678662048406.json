By passively sensing this beat, we reveal new scene information which includes: the type of bulbs in the scene, the phases of the electric grid up to city scale, and the light transport matrix. This information yields unmixing of reflections and semi-reflections, nocturnal high dynamic range, and scene rendering with bulbs not observed during acquisition. The latter is facilitated by a database of bulb response functions for a range of sources, which we collected and provide. To do all this, we built a novel coded-exposure high-dynamic-range imaging technique, specifically designed to operate on the grids AC lighting.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Mark Sheinin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheinin:Mark", "Yoav Y.
