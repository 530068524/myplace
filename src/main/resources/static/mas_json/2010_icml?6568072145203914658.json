{"title": "Gaussian Covariance and Scalable Variational Inference.", "fields": ["bayesian experimental design", "approximate inference", "variational message passing", "covariance", "frequentist inference"], "abstract": "We analyze computational aspects of variational approximate inference techniques for sparse linear models, which have to be understood to allow for large scale applications. Gaussian covariances play a key role, whose approximation is computationally hard. While most previous methods gain scalability by not even representing most posterior dependencies, harmful factorization assumptions can be avoided by employing data-dependent low-rank approximations instead. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into algorithmic and statistical consequences of low-rank covariance approximation errors on decision outcomes in nonlinear sequential Bayesian experimental design.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Matthias W.
