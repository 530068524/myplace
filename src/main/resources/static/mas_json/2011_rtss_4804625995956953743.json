{"title": "Effective and Efficient Scheduling of Certifiable Mixed-Criticality Sporadic Task Systems.", "fields": ["metrical task system", "workload", "correctness", "mixed criticality", "criticality"], "abstract": "An increasing trend in embedded system design is to integrate components with different levels of criticality into a shared hardware platform for better cost and power efficiency. Such mixed-criticality systems are subject to certifications at different levels of rigorousness, for validating the correctness of different subsystems on various confidence levels. The real-time scheduling of certifiable mixed-criticality systems has been recognized to be a challenging problem, where using traditional scheduling techniques may result in unacceptable resource waste. In this paper we present an algorithm called PLRS to schedule certifiable mixed-criticality sporadic tasks systems. PLRS uses fixed-job-priority scheduling, and assigns job priorities by exploring and balancing the asymmetric effects between the workload on different criticality levels. Comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithm by Li and Baruah for such systems, which we refer to as LB, PLRS is both more effective and more efficient: (i) The schedulability test of PLRS not only theoretically dominates, but also on average significantly outperforms LB's. (ii) The run-time complexity of PLRS is polynomial (quadratic in the number of tasks), which is much more efficient than the pseudo-polynomial run-time complexity of LB.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Uppsala University", "Uppsala University", "Uppsala University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Nan Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Nan", "Pontus Ekberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ekberg:Pontus", "Martin Stigge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stigge:Martin", "Wang Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi_0001:Wang"], "pages": 11}
