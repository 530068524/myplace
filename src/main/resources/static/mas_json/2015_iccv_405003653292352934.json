Optical flow estimation has not been among the tasks CNNs succeeded at. In this paper we construct CNNs which are capable of solving the optical flow estimation problem as a supervised learning task. We propose and compare two architectures: a generic architecture and another one including a layer that correlates feature vectors at different image locations. Since existing ground truth data sets are not sufficiently large to train a CNN, we generate a large synthetic Flying Chairs dataset. We show that networks trained on this unrealistic data still generalize very well to existing datasets such as Sintel and KITTI, achieving competitive accuracy at frame rates of 5 to 10 fps.", "citation": "Citations (493)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Alexey Dosovitskiy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dosovitskiy:Alexey", "Philipp Fischer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischer:Philipp", "Eddy Ilg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilg:Eddy", "Philip H\u00e4usser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=auml=usser:Philip", "Caner Hazirbas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazirbas:Caner", "Vladimir Golkov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golkov:Vladimir", "Patrick van der Smagt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smagt:Patrick_van_der", "Daniel Cremers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cremers:Daniel", "Thomas Brox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brox:Thomas"], "pages": 9}
