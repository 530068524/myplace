Unlike related previous models, our\ngenerative model is fully tractable: both the likelihood\nand the posterior estimates of latent variables\ncan readily be computed with analytically\nsimple formulae. The model is particularly simple\nin the case of complex-valued data since\nthe pooling can be reduced to taking the modulus\nof complex numbers. Experiments on electroencephalography\n(EEG) and natural images\ndemonstrate the validity of the method.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "University of Helsinki", "Fraunhofer Society"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Junichiro Hirayama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirayama:Junichiro", "Aapo Hyv\u00e4rinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hyv=auml=rinen:Aapo", "Motoaki Kawanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawanabe:Motoaki"], "pages": 10}
