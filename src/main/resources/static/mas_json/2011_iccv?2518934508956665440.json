{"title": "Extracting adaptive contextual cues from unlabeled regions.", "fields": ["context model", "contextual image classification", "exploit", "granularity", "commit"], "abstract": "Existing approaches to contextual reasoning for enhanced object detection typically utilize other labeled categories in the images to provide contextual information. As a consequence, they inadvertently commit to the granularity of information implicit in the labels. Moreover, large portions of the images may not belong to any of the manually-chosen categories, and these unlabeled regions are typically neglected. In this paper, we overcome both these drawbacks and propose a contextual cue that exploits unlabeled regions in images. Our approach adaptively determines the granularity (scene, inter-object, intra-object, etc.) at which contextual information is captured. In order to extract the proposed contextual cue, we consider a scene to be a structured configuration of objects and regions; just as an object is a composition of parts. We thus learn our proposed \u201ccontextual meta-objects\u201d using any off-the-shelf object detector, which makes our proposed cue widely accessible to the community. Our results show that incorporating our proposed cue provides a relative improvement of 12% over a state-of-the-art object detector on the challenging PASCAL dataset.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Toyota Technological Institute", "Cornell University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Congcong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Congcong", "Devi Parikh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parikh:Devi", "Tsuhan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Tsuhan"], "pages": 8}
