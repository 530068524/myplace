{"title": "The algebraic dichotomy conjecture for infinite domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems.", "fields": ["bounded function", "conjecture", "algebraic number", "topological property", "if and only if"], "abstract": "We prove that an \u03c9-categorical core structure primitively positively interprets all finite structures with parameters if and only if some stabilizer of its polymorphism clone has a homomorphism to the clone of projections, and that this happens if and only if its polymorphism clone does not contain operations \u03b1, \u03b2, s satisfying the identity \u03b1s(x, y, x, z, y, z) \u2248 \u03b2s(y, x, z, x, z, y).   This establishes an algebraic criterion equivalent to the conjectured borderline between P and NP-complete CSPs over reducts of finitely bounded homogenous structures, and accomplishes one of the steps of a proposed strategy for reducing the infinite domain CSP dichotomy conjecture to the finite case.   Our theorem is also of independent mathematical interest, characterizing a topological property of any \u03c9-categorical core structure (the existence of a continuous homomorphism of a stabilizer of its polymorphism clone to the projections) in purely algebraic terms (the failure of an identity as above).", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Charles University in Prague", "Charles University in Prague"], "authors": ["Libor Barto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barto:Libor", "Michael Pinsker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinsker:Michael"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
