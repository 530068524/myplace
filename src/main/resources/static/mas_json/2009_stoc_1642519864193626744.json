{"title": "On cryptography with auxiliary input.", "fields": ["symmetric key algorithm", "extractor", "obfuscation", "error detection and correction", "cryptography"], "abstract": "We study the question of designing cryptographic schemes which are secure even if an  arbitrary  function f(sk) of the secret key is leaked, as long as the secret key sk is still (exponentially) hard to compute from this auxiliary input. This setting of auxiliary input is more general than the more traditional setting, which assumes that some of information about the secret key sk may be leaked, but sk still has high min-entropy left. In particular, we deal with situations where f(sk)  information-theoretically determines  the entire secret key sk.   As our main result, we construct CPA/CCA secure symmetric encryption schemes that remain secure with exponentially hard-to-invert auxiliary input. We give several applications of such schemes. * We construct an average-case obfuscator for the class of point functions, which remains secure with exponentially hard-to-invert auxiliary input, and is reusable. * We construct a  reusable  and  robust  extractor that remains secure with exponentially hard-to-invert auxiliary input. Our results rely on a new cryptographic assumption, Learning Subspace-with-Noise (LSN), which is related to the well known Learning Parity-with-Noise (LPN) assumption.", "citation": "Citations (201)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "NYU, NY, NY, USA"], "authors": ["Yevgeniy Dodis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dodis:Yevgeniy", "Yael Tauman Kalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalai:Yael_Tauman", "Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
