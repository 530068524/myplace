Our model describes human behaviour at multiple levels of detail, ranging from low-level actions through to high-level events. We also include a model of social roles, the expected behaviours of certain people, or groups of people, in a scene. The hierarchical model includes these varied representations, and various forms of interactions between people present in a scene. The model is trained in a discriminative max-margin framework. Experimental results demonstrate that this model can improve performance at all considered levels of detail, on two challenging datasets.", "citation": "Citations (143)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Disney Research", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tian Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Tian", "Leonid Sigal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sigal:Leonid", "Greg Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Greg"], "pages": 8}
