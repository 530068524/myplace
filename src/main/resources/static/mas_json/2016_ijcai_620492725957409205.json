{"title": "Leviathan: A New LTL Satisfiability Checking Tool Based on a One-Pass Tree-Shaped Tableau.", "fields": ["computer science", "satisfiability", "algorithm", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "The paper presents Leviathan, an LTL satisfiability checking tool based on a novel one-pass, treelike tableau system, which is way simpler than existing solutions. Despite the simplicity of the algorithm, the tool has performance comparable in speed and memory consumption with other tools on a number of standard benchmark sets, and, in various cases, it outperforms the other tableau-based tools.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Udine", "University of Udine", "University of Udine", "University of Western Australia"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Matteo Bertello.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertello:Matteo", "Nicola Gigante.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gigante:Nicola", "Angelo Montanari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montanari:Angelo", "Mark Reynolds.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reynolds:Mark"], "pages": 7}
