{"title": "Insight into goal-directed movement strategies.", "fields": ["computer science", "computer vision", "artificial intelligence", "input device", "simulation"], "abstract": "The current paper proposes a novel method of analyzing goal-directed movements by dividing them into distinct movement intervals. We demonstrate how the description of the first and second most prominent movement intervals in terms of duration and length can provide insight into the applied movement strategies under different conditions. This method, although demonstrated for goal-directed movements, has the potential to be generalized to other types of movements, such as steering movements.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Philips", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "authors": ["Karin Nieuwenhuizen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nieuwenhuizen:Karin", "Dzmitry Aliakseyeu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aliakseyeu:Dzmitry", "Jean-Bernard Martens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martens:Jean=Bernard"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
