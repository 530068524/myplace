Since the number of possible bounding boxes in an image is very large O(#pixels2), even a single linear scan to perform the greedy augmentation for submodular maximization is intractable. Thus, we formulate the greedy augmentation step as a Branch-and-Bound scheme. In order to speed up repeated application of B&B, we propose a novel generalization of Minoux's 'lazy greedy' algorithm to the B&B tree. Theoretically, our proposed formulation provides a new understanding to the problem, and contains classic heuristic approaches such as Sliding Window+Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) and and Efficient Subwindow Search (ESS) as special cases. Empirically, we show that our approach leads to a state-of-art performance on object proposal generation via a novel diversity measure.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Qing Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Qing", "Dhruv Batra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Batra:Dhruv"], "pages": 9}
