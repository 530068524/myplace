Different from the asynchronous and online based SNGs, we present  Surprise Grabber  to see how tangible gesture interface could benefit the synchronous co-located social game. In  Surprise Grabber , users control a virtual grabber's moving in 3D game to catch the gifts by using their camera phone. An efficient code running on the phone detects hand motion, delivers results to Serve PC and provides feedbacks in real time. Distinguished from online SNGS, all players stand together in front of a public display. The results of the pilot user studies showed that: 1) Gesture interface was easy to catch up and made the game more immersive; 2) Occasionally inaccuracy in hand motion detection made the game more competitive instead of frustrating players; 3) Players' performances were obviously influenced by the social atmosphere; 4) In most cases, players' performances became better or worse at the same time.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Mingming Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan_0001:Mingming", "Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xin", "Yu Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong:Yu", "Li Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Li", "Yuanchun Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Yuanchun", "Hao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hao"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
