{"title": "Identification of Speakers in Novels.", "fields": ["speech recognition", "natural language processing", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "narrative"], "abstract": "Speaker identification is the task of attributing utterances to characters in a literary narrative. It is challenging to automate because the speakers of the majority of utterances are not explicitly identified in novels. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning approach for the task that incorporates several novel features. The experimental results show that our method is more accurate and general than previous approaches to the problem.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Alberta", "University of Alberta"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hua He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Hua", "Denilson Barbosa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barbosa:Denilson", "Grzegorz Kondrak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kondrak:Grzegorz"], "pages": 9}
