This paper describes MAQS, a personalized mobile sensing system for IAQ monitoring. In contrast with existing stationary or outdoor air quality sensing systems, MAQS users carry portable, indoor location tracking sensors that provide personalized IAQ information. To improve accuracy and energy efficiency, MAQS incorporates three novel techniques: (1) an accurate temporal n-gram augmented Bayesian room localization method that requires few Wi-Fi fingerprints; (2) an air exchange rate based IAQ sensing method, which measures general IAQ using only CO 2  sensors; and (3) a zone-based proximity detection method for collaborative sensing, which saves energy and enables data sharing among users. MAQS has been deployed and evaluated via user study. Detailed evaluation results demonstrate that MAQS supports accurate personalized IAQ monitoring and quantitative analysis with high energy efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Yifei Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yifei", "Kun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Kun", "Lei Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Lei", "Ricardo Piedrahita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piedrahita:Ricardo", "Xiang Yun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yun:Xiang", "Omkar Mansata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mansata:Omkar", "Qin Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Qin", "Robert P.
