{"title": "The Way They Move: Tracking Multiple Targets with Similar Appearance.", "fields": ["object detection", "computer vision", "field of view", "missing data", "computational complexity theory"], "abstract": "We introduce a computationally efficient algorithm for multi-object tracking by detection that addresses four main challenges: appearance similarity among targets, missing data due to targets being out of the field of view or occluded behind other objects, crossing trajectories, and camera motion. The proposed method uses motion dynamics as a cue to distinguish targets with similar appearance, minimize target mis-identification and recover missing data. Computational efficiency is achieved by using a Generalized Linear Assignment (GLA) coupled with efficient procedures to recover missing data and estimate the complexity of the underlying dynamics. The proposed approach works with track lets of arbitrary length and does not assume a dynamical model a priori, yet it captures the overall motion dynamics of the targets. Experiments using challenging videos show that this framework can handle complex target motions, non-stationary cameras and long occlusions, on scenarios where appearance cues are not available or poor.", "citation": "Citations (157)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Caglayan Dicle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dicle:Caglayan", "Octavia I.
