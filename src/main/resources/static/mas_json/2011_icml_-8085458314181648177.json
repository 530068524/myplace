To address the scalability problem of NPKL, we propose a novel algorithm called BCDNPKL, which is very efficient and scalable. Superior to most existing approaches, BCDNPKL keeps away from semidefinite programming (SDP) and eigen-decomposition, which benefits from two findings: 1) The original SDP framework of NPKL can be reduced into a far smaller-sized counterpart which is corresponding to the sub-kernel (referred to as boundary kernel) learning; 2) The sub-kernel learning can be efficiently solved by using the proposed block coordinate descent (BCD) technique. We provide a formal proof of global convergence for our BCDNPKL algorithm. The extensive experiments verify the scalability and effectiveness of BCDNPKL, compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Yunnan Normal University", "Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Enliang Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Enliang", "Bo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0022:Bo", "Songcan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Songcan"], "pages": 8}
