In a URL  http://www.example.com/path/ , for instance, the protocol  http , the host  www.example.com , and the path  path  would be handled by different functions and stored in different variables. Given a set of sample inputs, we use  dynamic tainting  to trace the data flow of each input character, and aggregate those input fragments that would be handled by the same function into lexical and syntactical entities. The result is a  context-free grammar  that reflects valid input structure. In its evaluation, our AUTOGRAM prototype automatically produced readable and structurally accurate grammars for inputs like URLs, spreadsheets or configuration files. The resulting grammars not only allow simple reverse engineering of input formats, but can also directly serve as input for test generators.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "authors": ["Matthias H\u00f6schele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=schele:Matthias", "Andreas Zeller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeller:Andreas"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2016", "pages": 6}
