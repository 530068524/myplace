By treating each detector as an agent, we present the first collaborative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for joint active object localization, which effectively exploits such beneficial contextual information. We learn inter-agent communication through cross connections with gates between the Q-networks, which is facilitated by a novel multi-agent deep Q-learning algorithm with joint exploitation sampling. We verify our proposed method on multiple object detection benchmarks. Not only does our model help to improve the performance of state-of-the-art active localization models, it also reveals interesting co-detection patterns that are intuitively interpretable.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Peking University", "Microsoft", "Peking University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xiangyu Kong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kong:Xiangyu", "Bo Xin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xin:Bo", "Yizhou Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yizhou", "Gang Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Gang"], "pages": 10}
