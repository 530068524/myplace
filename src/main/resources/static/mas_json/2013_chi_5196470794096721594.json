{"title": "NailDisplay: bringing an always available visual display to fingertips.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "graphical user interface elements", "display device", "the imaginary", "computer hardware"], "abstract": "This work presents a novel and always-available nail mounted display known as  NailDisplay . The proposed display augments the use of a finger by allowing for always-available visual feedback owing to its fast accessibility and binding user controls with the display,  i.e.  what you control is what you see (through the display). Potential benefits of  NailDisplay  are demonstrated in three applications: from displaying to combining it with user controls. In the first application,  NailDisplay  can reveal what is occluded under a finger touch, making it a solution to operate small UI elements. In the second application,  NailDisplay  is complementary to an imaginary interface, helping users to learn an imaginary interface ( e.g. , on the users' arms) and allowing them to reassure the interface when their memory of it becomes unclear. In the third application,  NailDisplay  is integrated with rich finger interactions, such as swiping in the air. We also report users' feedbacks gathered from an explorative user study.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "Academia Sinica", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Chao-Huai Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Chao=Huai", "Li-Wei Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Li=Wei", "Chien-Ting Weng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weng:Chien=Ting", "Rong-Hao Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Rong=Hao", "Kai-Yin Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Kai=Yin", "Bing-Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Bing=Yu"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
