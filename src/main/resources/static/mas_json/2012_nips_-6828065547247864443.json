{"title": "Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation with Non-Parametric Copulas.", "fields": ["copula", "marginal distribution", "bivariate analysis", "vine copula"], "abstract": "A new framework based on the theory of copulas is proposed to address semi-supervised domain adaptation problems. The presented method factorizes any multivariate density into a product of marginal distributions and bivariate copula functions. Therefore, changes in each of these factors can be detected and corrected to adapt a density model accross different learning domains. Importantly, we introduce a novel vine copula model, which allows for this factorization in a non-parametric manner. Experimental results on regression problems with real-world data illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach when compared to state-of-the-art techniques.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "University of Cambridge", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["David L\u00f3pez-Paz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=oacute=pez=Paz:David", "Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hern=aacute=ndez=Lobato:Jos=eacute=_Miguel", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
