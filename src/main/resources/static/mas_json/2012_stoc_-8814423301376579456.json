We show an efficient randomized algorithm that routes \u03a9(OPT/poly log k) demand pairs with congestion at most 14, where OPT is the maximum number of pairs that can be simultaneously routed on edge-disjoint paths. The best previous algorithm that routed \u03a9(OPT/poly log n) pairs required congestion poly(log log n), and for the setting where the maximum allowed congestion is bounded by a constant c, the best previous algorithms could only guarantee the routing of OPT/n O(1/c)  pairs.   We also introduce a new type of vertex sparsifiers that we call  integral flow sparsifiers , which approximately preserve both fractional and integral routings, and show an algorithm to construct such sparsifiers.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Julia Chuzhoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuzhoy:Julia"], "pages": 20}
