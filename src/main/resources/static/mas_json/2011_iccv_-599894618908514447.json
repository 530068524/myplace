To discover the manifold structure hidden among mid-level features, we develop spectral embedding approaches based on graphs and hypergraphs, without the need to tune any parameter for graph construction which is a key step of manifold learning. In particular, the traditional graphs are constructed by linear reconstruction with sparse coding. In the new embedding space, we learn high-level latent semantics automatically from abundant mid-level features through spectral clustering. The learnt latent semantics can be readily used for action recognition with SVM by defining a histogram intersection kernel. Different from the traditional latent semantic analysis based on topic models, our two spectral methods for semantic learning can discover the manifold structure hidden among mid-level features, which results in compact but discriminative high-level features. The experimental results on two standard action datasets have shown the superior performance of our spectral methods.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "City University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Zhiwu Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhiwu", "Yuxin Peng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peng:Yuxin", "Horace Ho-Shing Ip.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ip:Horace_Ho=Shing"], "pages": 8}
