We say that the relaxation is totally half-integral if f ? ( x ) is a polyhedral function with half-integral extreme points x , and this property is preserved after adding an arbitrary combination of constraints of the form x i = x j , x i = 1 - x j , and x i = \u03b3 where \u03b3 ? { 0 , 1 , 1 2 } is a constant. A well-known example is the roof duality relaxation for quadratic pseudo-Boolean functions f . We argue that total half-integrality is a natural requirement for generalizations of roof duality to arbitrary pseudo-Boolean functions.Our contributions are as follows. First, we provide a complete characterization of totally half-integral relaxations f ? by establishing a one-to-one correspondence with bisubmodular functions. Second, we give a new characterization of bisubmodular functions. Finally, we show some relationships between general totally half-integral relaxations and relaxations based on the roof duality.On the conceptual level, our results show that bisubmodular functions provide a natural generalization of the roof duality approach to higher-order terms. This can be viewed as a non-submodular analogue of the fact that submodular functions generalize the s - t minimum cut problem with non-negative weights to higher-order terms.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "University College London"], "authors": ["Vladimir Kolmogorov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolmogorov:Vladimir"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
