However, the effect of elastic stiffness has not been thoroughly investigated nor its interaction with control gain. In a controlled experiment, these factors are investigated along with user feedback regarding ease-of-use and fatigue. The results reveal a U-shaped profile of control gain vs. movement time, with different profiles for different stiffness levels. Using the optimum control gain for each stiffness level, performance across stiffness levels were similar. However, users preferred lower stiffness and lower control gain levels due to increased controller displacement. Based on these results, design guidelines for elastic rate control devices are given.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["university of lille", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["G\u00e9ry Casiez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casiez:G=eacute=ry", "Daniel Vogel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogel_0001:Daniel"], "pages": 10}
