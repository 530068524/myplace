We describe an end-to-end discriminative probabilistic model for coreference that, along with standard pairwise features, enforces structural agreement constraints between specified properties of coreferent mentions. This model can be represented as a factor graph for each document that admits efficient inference via belief propagation. We show that our method can use entity-level information to outperform a basic pairwise system.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Greg Durrett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durrett:Greg", "David Leo Wright Hall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hall:David_Leo_Wright", "Dan Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Dan"], "pages": 11}
