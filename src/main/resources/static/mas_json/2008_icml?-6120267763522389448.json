{"title": "A unified architecture for natural language processing: deep neural networks with multitask learning.", "fields": ["convolutional neural network", "word embedding", "language identification", "semantic role labeling", "multi task learning"], "abstract": "We describe a single convolutional neural network architecture that, given a sentence, outputs a host of language processing predictions: part-of-speech tags, chunks, named entity tags, semantic roles, semantically similar words and the likelihood that the sentence makes sense (grammatically and semantically) using a language model. The entire network is trained  jointly  on all these tasks using weight-sharing, an instance of  multitask learning . All the tasks use labeled data except the language model which is learnt from unlabeled text and represents a novel form of  semi-supervised learning  for the shared tasks. We show how both  multitask learning  and  semi-supervised learning  improve the generalization of the shared tasks, resulting in state-of-the-art-performance.", "citation": "Citations (2,744)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ronan Collobert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collobert:Ronan", "Jason Weston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weston:Jason"], "pages": 8}
