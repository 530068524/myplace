{"title": "A Formal Foundation for Secure Remote Execution of Enclaves.", "fields": ["secure two party computation", "adversary model", "adversary", "mathematical proof", "parameterized complexity"], "abstract": "Recent proposals for trusted hardware platforms, such as Intel SGX and the MIT Sanctum processor, offer compelling security features but lack formal guarantees. We introduce a verification methodology based on a trusted abstract platform (TAP), a formalization of idealized enclave platforms along with a parameterized adversary. We also formalize the notion of secure remote execution and present machine-checked proofs showing that the TAP satisfies the three key security properties that entail secure remote execution: integrity, confidentiality and secure measurement. We then present machine-checked proofs showing that SGX and Sanctum are refinements of the TAP under certain parameterizations of the adversary, demonstrating that these systems implement secure enclaves for the stated adversary models.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Pramod Subramanyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanyan:Pramod", "Rohit Sinha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinha_0001:Rohit", "Ilia A.
