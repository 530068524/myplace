{"title": "280 Birds With One Stone: Inducing Multilingual Taxonomies From Wikipedia Using Character-Level Classification.", "fields": ["computer science", "machine learning", "interlanguage", "artificial intelligence", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We propose a simple, yet effective, approach towards inducing multilingual taxonomies from Wikipedia. Given an English taxonomy, our approach leverages the interlanguage links of Wikipedia followed by character-level classifiers to induce high-precision, high-coverage taxonomies in other languages. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, heuristics-heavy approaches for six languages. As a consequence of our work, we release presumably the largest and the most accurate multilingual taxonomic resource spanning over 280 languages.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Amit Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Amit", "R\u00e9mi Lebret.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lebret:R=eacute=mi", "Hamza Harkous.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harkous:Hamza", "Karl Aberer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aberer:Karl"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
