{"title": "Inferring Same-As Facts from Linked Data: An Iterative Import-by-Query Approach.", "fields": ["rewriting", "linked data", "data mining", "cloud computing", "machine learning"], "abstract": "In this paper we model the problem of data linkage in Linked Data as a reasoning problem on possibly decentralized data. We describe a novel import-by-query algorithm that alternates steps of sub-query rewriting and of tailored querying the Linked Data cloud in order to import data as specific as possible for inferring or contradicting given target same-as facts. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach and its usefulness in practice for data linkage and disambiguation.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Institut Universitaire de France", "Institut Nation ... -Marne, France"], "authors": ["Mustafa Al-Bakri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Al=Bakri:Mustafa", "Manuel Atencia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atencia:Manuel", "Steffen Lalande.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lalande:Steffen", "Marie-Christine Rousset.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rousset:Marie=Christine"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
