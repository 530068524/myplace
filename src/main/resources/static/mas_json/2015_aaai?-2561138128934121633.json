Such problems can be naturally modeled as constrained partially observable Markov decision processes (CPOMDPs) when the environment is partially observable. In this work, we describe a technique based on approximate linear programming to optimize policies in CPOMDPs. The optimization is performed offline and produces a finite state controller with desirable performance guarantees. The approach outperforms a constrained version of point-based value iteration on a suite of benchmark problems.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Department of C ... hnology, Korea", "Department of C ... hnology, Korea"], "authors": ["Pascal Poupart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poupart:Pascal", "Aarti Malhotra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malhotra:Aarti", "Pei Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Pei", "Kee-Eung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kee=Eung", "Bongseok Goh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goh:Bongseok", "Michael Bowling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bowling:Michael"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
