{"title": "Interactive data exploration using semantic windows.", "fields": ["computation", "semantics", "stars", "big data", "data exploration"], "abstract": "We present a new interactive data exploration approach, called Semantic Windows (SW), in which users query for multidimensional \"windows\" of interest via standard DBMS-style queries enhanced with exploration constructs. Users can specify SWs using (i) shape-based properties, e.g., \"identify all 3-by-3 windows\", as well as (ii) content-based properties, e.g., \"identify all windows in which the average brightness of stars exceeds 0.8\". This SW approach enables the interactive processing of a host of useful exploratory queries that are difficult to express and optimize using standard DBMS techniques. SW uses a sampling-guided, data-driven search strategy to explore the underlying data set and quickly identify windows of interest. To facilitate human-in-the-loop style interactive processing, SW is optimized to produce online results during query execution. To control the tension between online performance and query completion time, it uses a tunable, adaptive prefetching technique. To enable exploration of big data, the framework supports distributed computation.   We describe the semantics and implementation of SW as a distributed layer on top of PostgreSQL. The experimental results with real astronomical and artificial data reveal that SW can offer online results quickly and continuously with little or no degradation in query completion times.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Alexander Kalinin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalinin_0001:Alexander", "Ugur \u00c7etintemel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ccedil=etintemel:Ugur", "Stanley B.
