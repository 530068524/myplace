In this work, we consider the sensor selection problem in a general time-dependent and location-aware participatory sensing system, taking the long-term user participation incentive into explicit consideration. We study the problem systematically under different information scenarios, regarding both future information and current information (realization). In particular, we propose a Lyapunov-based VCG auction policy for the on-line sensor selection, which converges asymptotically to the optimal off-line benchmark performance, even with no future information and under asymmetry of current information. Extensive numerical results show that our proposed policy outperforms the state-of-art policies in the literature, in terms of both user participation (e.g., reducing the user dropping probability by 25% \u223c 90%) and social performance (e.g., increasing the social welfare by 15% \u223c 80%).", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of Macau", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Lin Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao_0001:Lin", "Fen Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:Fen", "Jianwei Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jianwei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
