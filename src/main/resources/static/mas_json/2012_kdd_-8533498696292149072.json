However, there are no clear guidelines on how to set e to satisfy a privacy policy. We give an alternate formulation,  Differential Identifiability , parameterized by the probability of individual identification. This provides the strong privacy guarantees of differential privacy, while letting policy makers set parameters based on the established privacy concept of individual identifiability.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Jaewoo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jaewoo", "Chris Clifton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clifton:Chris"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
