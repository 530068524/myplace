An EDF-based scheduling algorithm is proved optimal under the speedup factor metric, and a speedup-optimal sufficient schedulability test is derived.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Abhishek Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Abhishek", "Sanjoy Baruah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baruah:Sanjoy"], "pages": 12}
