In this demonstration, we show the overall system architecture, explain in detail the implementation of the components that crawl, classify, and rank tweets and extract location from tweets, and present some interesting results of our system.", "citation": "Citations (357)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Brigham Young University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "National Center for Supercomputing Applications"], "authors": ["Rui Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Rui", "Kin Hou Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Kin_Hou", "Ravi Khadiwala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khadiwala:Ravi", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kevin_Chen=Chuan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
