The main idea is formalized as a new, factored state-transition representation that supports efficient online-learning of the relevant features. We construct the transition models through predicting how the actions change the world. We introduce an online sparse coding learning technique for feature selection in high-dimensional spaces. We derive theoretical guarantees for our framework and empirically demonstrate its practicality in both simulated and real robotics domains.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Trung Thanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen_0005:Trung_Thanh", "Zhuoru Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zhuoru", "Tomi Silander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silander:Tomi", "Tze-Yun Leong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leong:Tze=Yun"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
