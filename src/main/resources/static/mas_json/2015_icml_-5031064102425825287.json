This paper presents a novel degree prior to study the inference of scale-free networks, which are widely used to model social and biological networks. In particular, this paper formulates scale-free network inference using Gaussian Graphical model (GGM) regularized by a node degree prior. Our degree prior not only promotes a desirable global degree distribution, but also exploits the estimated degree of an individual node and the relative strength of all the edges of a single node. To fulfill this, this paper proposes a ranking-based method to dynamically estimate the degree of a node, which makes the resultant optimization problem challenging to solve. To deal with this, this paper presents a novel ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) procedure. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real data show that our prior not only yields a scalefree network, but also produces many more correctly predicted edges than existing scale-free inducing prior, hub-inducing prior and the l1 norm.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Qingming Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Qingming", "Siqi Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Siqi", "Jinbo Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jinbo"], "pages": 9}
