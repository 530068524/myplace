A  revocable  timed-release encryption is one where, before the time  T  is over, the sender can \u201cgive back\u201d the timed-release encryption, provably loosing all access to the data. We show that revocable timed-release encryption without trusted parties is possible using quantum cryptography (while trivially impossible classically).   Along the way, we develop two proof techniques in the quantum random oracle model that we believe may have applications also for other protocols.   Finally, we also develop another new primitive,  unknown recipient encryption , which allows us to send a message to an unknown/unspecified recipient over an insecure network in such a way that at most one recipient will get the message.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Tartu", "University of Tartu"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Dominique Unruh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Unruh:Dominique"], "pages": 18}
