Drawing on ethnographic observations at a local technology goods market in Bangalore, India, the study details the use of a landline telephone intercom system as the primary tool for business communication in the market. Through analyzing how the intercom system relates to informality and physical space, the paper argues that it bridges the formal with the informal, and helps facilitate informal business practices while also allowing them to remain hidden from the formal regulatory gaze of the state.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Priyank Chandra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandra:Priyank"], "pages": 11}
