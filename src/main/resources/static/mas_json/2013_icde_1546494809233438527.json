Increasing concerns about data security and privacy in the cloud, however, have arisen. Ensuring security and privacy for data management and query processing in the cloud is critical for better and broader uses of the cloud. This tutorial covers recent research on cloud security and privacy, while focusing on the works that protect data confidentiality and query access privacy for sensitive data being stored and queried in the cloud. We provide a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art schemes and techniques for protecting data confidentiality and access privacy, and explain their tradeoffs in security, privacy, functionality and performance.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Divyakant Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Divyakant", "Amr El Abbadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbadi:Amr_El", "Shiyuan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shiyuan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
