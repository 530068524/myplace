In this work we present a novel approach to learn a forward simulation model via simple search over pixel input. We make use of a video game, Super Mario Bros., as an initial test of our approach as it represents a physics system that is significantly less complex than reality. We demonstrate the significant improvement of our approach in predicting future states compared with a baseline CNN and apply the learned model to train a game playing agent. Thus we evaluate the algorithm in terms of the accuracy and value of its output model.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Matthew Guzdial.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guzdial:Matthew", "Boyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Boyang", "Mark O.
