In this paper, we present a new branching-time temporal logic, called Substructure Temporal Logic (STL*, for short), whose distinctive feature is to allow for quantifying over the possible substructure of a given structure. This logic is obtained by adding two new operators to CTL*, whose interpretation is given relative to the partial order induced by a suitable substructure relation. STL* turns out to be very expressive and allows to capture in a very natural way many well known problems, such as module checking, reactive synthesis and reasoning about games. A formal account of the model theoretic properties of the new logic and results about (un)decidability and complexity of related decision problems are also provided.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Univ. degli Stu ... , Naples, Italy", "Univ. degli Stu ... , Naples, Italy", "Univ. degli Stu ... , Naples, Italy", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... oli Federico II", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... oli Federico II", "Universit\u00e0 degl ... oli Federico II"], "authors": ["Massimo Benerecetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benerecetti:Massimo", "Fabio Mogavero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mogavero:Fabio", "Aniello Murano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murano:Aniello"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
