Our approach represents a scene as a collection of region models (\u201cparts\u201d) arranged in a reconfigurable pattern. We partition an image into a predefined set of regions and use a latent variable to specify which region model is assigned to each image region. In our current implementation we use a bag of words representation to capture the appearance of an image region. The resulting method generalizes a spatial bag of words approach that relies on a fixed model for the bag of words in each image region. Our models can be trained using both generative and discriminative methods. In the generative setting we use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate model parameters from a collection of images with category labels. In the discriminative setting we use a latent structural SVM (LSSVM). We note that LSSVMs can be very sensitive to initialization and demonstrate that generative training with EM provides a good initialization for discriminative training with LSSVM.", "citation": "Citations (151)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Brown University", "Brown University", "Brown University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sobhan Naderi Parizi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parizi:Sobhan_Naderi", "John G.
