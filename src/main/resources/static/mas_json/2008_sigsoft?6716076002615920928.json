This paper makes a step towards this goal by describing an efficient technique for synthesizing pipeline configurations of feature-based systems. We identify and formalize a design pattern that is commonly used in featurebased development. We show that this pattern enables  compositional  synthesis of feature arrangements. In particular, the pattern allows us to add or remove features from an existing system without having to reconfigure the system from scratch. We describe an implementation of our technique and evaluate its applicability and effectiveness using a set of telecommunication features from AT&T, arranged within the DFC architecture.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "Imperial College London", "AT&T Labs"], "authors": ["Shiva Nejati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nejati:Shiva", "Mehrdad Sabetzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabetzadeh:Mehrdad", "Marsha Chechik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechik:Marsha", "Sebasti\u00e1n Uchitel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uchitel:Sebasti=aacute=n", "Pamela Zave.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zave:Pamela"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
