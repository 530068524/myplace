{"title": "A Three-Stage Load-Balancing Switch.", "fields": ["bounded function", "load balancing", "throughput", "optical switch", "schedule"], "abstract": "Recently there has been a great deal of interest in load-balancing switches due to their simple architecture and high bandwidth. In this paper we propose a three-stage load- balancing switch along with output load-balancing to address the mis-sequencing problem. We show that our proposed scheme provides a delay guarantee bounded by the delay of an OQ switch with the same input traffic plus a constant while achieving 100% throughput for admissible traffic with (sigma, rho) -upper constraint.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Analog Devices", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Xiaolin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaolin", "Yan Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai_0002:Yan", "Sheng Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Sheng", "Weibo Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Weibo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
