Indeed, it allows clause sharing between multiple processing units working on related (sub) problems. However, without limitation, sharing clauses might lead to an exponential blow up in communication or to the sharing of irrelevant clauses. This paper, proposes two innovative policies to dynamically adjust the size of shared clauses between any pair of processing units. The first approach controls the overall number of exchanged clauses whereas the second additionally exploits the relevance quality of shared clauses. Experimental results show important improvements of the state-of the-art parallel SAT solver.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Youssef Hamadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamadi:Youssef", "Sa\u00efd Jabbour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jabbour:Sa=iuml=d", "Lakhdar Sais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sais:Lakhdar"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
