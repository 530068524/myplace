{"title": "Clip: a tool for mapping hierarchical schemas.", "fields": ["document structure description", "star schema", "xquery", "xml schema", "xml schema editor"], "abstract": "Many data integration solutions in the market today include visual tools for schema mapping. Users connect schema elements with lines that are interpreted as high-level logical expressions capturing the relationship between source and target data-sets. These expressions are compiled into queries or programs that convert source-side data instances into target-side instances. In this demo we showcase Clip, an XML Schema mapping tool. Clip is distinguished from existing tools in that mappings explicitly specify structural transformations in addition to value correspondences. We show how Clip's users enter mappings by drawing lines and how these lines are translated into XQuery.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "IBM", "Universit\u00e0 Roma ... re, Roma, Italy"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Alessandro Raffio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raffio:Alessandro", "Daniele Braga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braga:Daniele", "Stefano Ceri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceri:Stefano", "Paolo Papotti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papotti:Paolo", "Mauricio A.
