The major novelty of our proposal stems from measuring distributional relationships between the labeled and unlabeled data. This is achieved from a stochastic translation model between data distributions that is estimated from a mixture model. The proposed classifier is defined from the combination of both the translation model and a kernel logistic regression on labeled data. Experimental results obtained over synthetic and real-world data sets validate the usefulness of our proposal.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["James I University", "James I University", "James I University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Henry Anaya-S\u00e1nchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anaya=S=aacute=nchez:Henry", "Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Sotoca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sotoca:Jos=eacute=_Mart=iacute=nez", "Adolfo Mart\u00ednez Us\u00f3.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Us=oacute=:Adolfo_Mart=iacute=nez"], "pages": 6}
