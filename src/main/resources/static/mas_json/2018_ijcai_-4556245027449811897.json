{"title": "Enhanced-alignment Measure for Binary Foreground Map Evaluation.", "fields": ["pixel", "ranking", "gaussian noise", "cognition", "binary number"], "abstract": "The existing binary foreground map (FM) measures to address various types of errors in either pixel-wise or structural ways. These measures consider pixel-level match or image-level information independently, while cognitive vision studies have shown that human vision is highly sensitive to both global information and local details in scenes. In this paper, we take a detailed look at current binary FM evaluation measures and propose a novel and effective E-measure (Enhanced-alignment measure). Our measure combines local pixel values with the image-level mean value in one term, jointly capturing image-level statistics and local pixel matching information. We demonstrate the superiority of our measure over the available measures on 4 popular datasets via 5 meta-measures, including ranking models for applications, demoting generic, random Gaussian noise maps, ground-truth switch, as well as human judgments. We find large improvements in almost all the meta-measures. For instance, in terms of application ranking, we observe improvementrangingfrom9.08% to 19.65% compared with other popular measures.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Nankai University", "Nankai University", "Nankai University", "Nankai University", "Nankai University"], "authors": ["Deng-Ping Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Deng=Ping", "Cheng Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Cheng", "Yang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yang", "Bo Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Bo", "Ming-Ming Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Ming=Ming", "Ali Borji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borji:Ali"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
