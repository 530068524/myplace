Informed by our own experience with such largescale pipelines, we focus on issues related to understanding, validating, cleaning, and enriching training data. The goal of the tutorial is to bring forth these issues, draw connections to prior work in the database literature, and outline the open research questions that are not addressed by prior art.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Neoklis Polyzotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polyzotis:Neoklis", "Sudip Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy_0002:Sudip", "Steven Euijong Whang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whang:Steven_Euijong", "Martin Zinkevich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zinkevich:Martin"], "pages": 4}
