{"title": "The Knowledge Accelerator: Big Picture Thinking in Small Pieces.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "software design pattern", "small number", "ranging", "scaffold"], "abstract": "Crowdsourcing offers a powerful new paradigm for online work. However, real world tasks are often interdependent, requiring a big picture view of the difference pieces involved. Existing crowdsourcing approaches that support such tasks -- ranging from Wikipedia to flash teams -- are bottlenecked by relying on a small number of individuals to maintain the big picture. In this paper, we explore the idea that a computational system can scaffold an emerging interdependent, big picture view entirely through the small contributions of individuals, each of whom sees only a part of the whole. To investigate the viability, strengths, and weaknesses of this approach we instantiate the idea in a prototype system for accomplishing distributed information synthesis and evaluate its output across a variety of topics. We also contribute a set of design patterns that may be informative for other systems aimed at supporting big picture thinking in small pieces.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Bosch", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Human-Computer  ... sburgh, PA, USA", "Human-Computer  ... sburgh, PA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Nathan Hahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hahn:Nathan", "Joseph Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Joseph", "Ji Eun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Ji_Eun", "Aniket Kittur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kittur:Aniket"], "pages": 13}
