In this process, matching of packet strings against signature patterns dominates the overall system performance. The MWM algorithm has been known as the fastest pattern matching algorithm when the patterns in a rule set rarely appear in packets. However, the matching time does not decrease if the length of the shortest pattern in a signature group is too short. In this paper, by extending the length of the shortest pattern, we minimize the pattern matching time of the algorithm which uses multi-byte unit. For example, when the length of the shortest pattern is less than 5, the proposed algorithm shows 38.87% enhancement in average.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University"], "authors": ["Yoon-Ho Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Yoon=Ho", "Moon-Young Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Moon=Young", "Seung-Woo Seo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seo:Seung=Woo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
