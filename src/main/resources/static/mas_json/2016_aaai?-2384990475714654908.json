{"title": "Approximation Algorithms for Route Planning with Nonlinear Objectives.", "fields": ["polynomial", "approximation algorithm", "monotonic function", "hop", "nonlinear system"], "abstract": "We consider optimal route planning when the objective function is a general nonlinear and non-monotonic function. Such an objective models user behavior more accurately, for example, when a user is risk-averse, or the utility function needs to capture a penalty for early arrival. It is known that as nonlinearity arises, the problem becomes NP-hard and little is known about computing optimal solutions when in addition there is no monotonicity guarantee. We show that an approximately optimal non-simple path can be efficiently computed under some natural constraints. In particular, we provide a fully polynomial approximation scheme under hop constraints. Our approximation algorithm can extend to run in pseudo-polynomial time under a more general linear constraint that sometimes is useful. As a by-product, we show that our algorithm can be applied to the problem of finding a path that is most likely to be on time for a given deadline.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Ger Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ger", "Evdokia Nikolova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikolova:Evdokia"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
