The notion that behavior in the natural world is in some sense optimal is explored by areas such as biomechanics and physical anthropology.  These fields propose a variety of candidate optimality criteria as possible formulations of the principles underlying natural motion.  Recent developments in computational biomechanics allow us to create articulated models of living creatures with a significant degree of biological realism.  I aim to bring these elements together in my research by using Reinforcement Learning to generate optimized behavior in biomechanical simulations.  Such a generative approach will allow us to examine critically postulated optimality criteria and investigate hypotheses that cannot be easily studied in the real world.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis"], "authors": ["Tom Erez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erez:Tom"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
