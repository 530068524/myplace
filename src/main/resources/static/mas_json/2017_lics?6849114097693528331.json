Our type theory is based on the definition of \u03c9-categories given by Maltsiniotis, himself inspired by Grothendieck's approach to the definition of \u03c9-groupoids. In this setup, \u03c9-categories are defined as presheaves preserving globular colimits over a certain category, called a coherator. The coherator encodes all operations required to be present in an \u03c9-category: both the compositions of pasting schemes as well as their coherences. Our main contribution is to provide a canonical type-theoretical characterization of pasting schemes as contexts which can be derived from inference rules. Finally, we present an implementation of a corresponding proof system.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique"], "authors": ["Eric Finster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finster:Eric", "Samuel Mimram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mimram:Samuel"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
