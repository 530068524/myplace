{"title": "A matrix expander Chernoff bound.", "fields": ["concentration inequality", "expander graph", "golden thompson inequality", "martingale", "chernoff bound"], "abstract": "We prove a Chernoff-type bound for sums of matrix-valued random variables sampled via a random walk on an expander, confirming a conjecture due to [Wigderson and Xiao 06]. Our proof is based on a new multi-matrix extension of the Golden-Thompson inequality which improves upon the inequality in [Sutter, Berta and Tomamichel 17], as well as an adaptation of an argument for the scalar case due to [Healy 08]. Our new multi-matrix Golden-Thompson inequality could be of independent interest. Secondarily, we also provide a generic reduction showing that any concentration inequality for vector-valued martingales implies a concentration inequality for the corresponding expander walk, with a weakening of parameters proportional to the squared mixing time.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Washington", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ankit Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Ankit", "Yin Tat Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yin_Tat", "Zhao Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Zhao", "Nikhil Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Nikhil"], "pages": 13}
