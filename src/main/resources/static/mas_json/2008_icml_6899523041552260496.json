We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite.", "citation": "Citations (2,664)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Pascal Vincent.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vincent:Pascal", "Hugo Larochelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larochelle:Hugo", "Yoshua Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Yoshua", "Pierre-Antoine Manzagol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manzagol:Pierre=Antoine"], "pages": 8}
