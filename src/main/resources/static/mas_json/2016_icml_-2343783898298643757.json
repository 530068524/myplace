{"title": "Recommendations as Treatments: Debiasing Learning and Evaluation.", "fields": ["estimation", "matrix decomposition", "debiasing", "causal inference", "estimator"], "abstract": "Most data for evaluating and training recommender systems is subject to selection biases, either through self-selection by the users or through the actions of the recommendation system itself. In this paper, we provide a principled approach to handle selection biases by adapting models and estimation techniques from causal inference. The approach leads to unbiased performance estimators despite biased data, and to a matrix factorization method that provides substantially improved prediction performance on real-world data. We theoretically and empirically characterize the robustness of the approach, and find that it is highly practical and scalable.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Tobias Schnabel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schnabel:Tobias", "Adith Swaminathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swaminathan:Adith", "Ashudeep Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Ashudeep", "Navin Chandak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandak:Navin", "Thorsten Joachims.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joachims:Thorsten"], "pages": 10}
