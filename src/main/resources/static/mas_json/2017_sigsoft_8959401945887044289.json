But do these approaches relate to the way practitioners actually locate, understand, and fix bugs? To help answer this question, we have collected a dataset named DBGBENCH --- the correct fault locations, bug diagnoses, and software patches of 27 real errors in open-source C projects that were consolidated from hundreds of debugging sessions of professional software engineers. Moreover, we shed light on the entire debugging process, from constructing a hypothesis to submitting a patch, and how debugging time, difficulty, and strategies vary across practitioners and types of errors. Most notably, DBGBENCH can serve as reality check for novel automated debugging and repair techniques.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Saarland University", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Saarland University", "SAP, Germany"], "authors": ["Marcel B\u00f6hme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hme:Marcel", "Ezekiel O.
