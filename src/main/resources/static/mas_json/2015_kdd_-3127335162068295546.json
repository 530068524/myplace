{"title": "Visual Search at Pinterest.", "fields": ["web service", "scratch", "visual search engine", "visual search", "computation"], "abstract": "We demonstrate that, with the availability of distributed computation platforms such as Amazon Web Services and open-source tools, it is possible for a small engineering team to build, launch and maintain a cost-effective, large-scale visual search system. We also demonstrate, through a comprehensive set of live experiments at Pinterest, that content recommendation powered by visual search improves user engagement. By sharing our implementation details and learnings from launching a commercial visual search engine from scratch, we hope visual search becomes more widely incorporated into today's commercial applications.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Pinterest, San  ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Pinterest, San  ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Pinterest, San  ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Pinterest, San  ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Pinterest, San  ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Yushi Jing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jing:Yushi", "David C.
