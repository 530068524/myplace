{"title": "One sketch for all: Theory and Application of Conditional Random Sampling.", "fields": ["pairwise comparison", "hamming distance", "estimator", "hamming code", "random projection"], "abstract": "Conditional Random Sampling (CRS) was originally proposed for efficiently computing pairwise (l2, l1) distances, in static, large-scale, and sparse data. This study modifies the original CRS and extends CRS to handle dynamic or streaming data, which much better reflect the real-world situation than assuming static data. Compared with many other sketching algorithms for dimension reductions such as stable random projections, CRS exhibits a significant advantage in that it is \"one-sketch-for-all.\" In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CRS in efficiently computing the Hamming norm, the Hamming distance, the lp distance, and the \u03c72 distance. A generic estimator and an approximate variance formula are also provided, for approximating any type of distances.\n\nWe recommend CRS as a promising tool for building highly scalable systems, in machine learning, data mining, recommender systems, and information retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Microsoft", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ping Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Ping", "Kenneth Ward Church.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Church:Kenneth_Ward", "Trevor Hastie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hastie:Trevor"], "pages": 8}
