For recognition, we use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) grounded via a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) onto the video. Training of LSTM is regularized using the output of another encoder LSTM (eLSTM) grounded on 3D human-skeleton training data. For such regularized training of LSTM, we modify the standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) in order to address the wellknown issues with gradient descent in constraint optimization. Our evaluation on three benchmark datasets \u2013 Sports-1M, HMDB-51, and UCF101 \u2013 shows accuracy improvements from 1.7% up to 14.8% relative to the state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (39)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Behrooz Mahasseni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahasseni:Behrooz", "Sinisa Todorovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Todorovic:Sinisa"], "pages": 9}
