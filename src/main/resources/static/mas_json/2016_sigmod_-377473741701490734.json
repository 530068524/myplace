{"title": "Top-k Relevant Semantic Place Retrieval on Spatial RDF Data.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "cwm", "simple knowledge organization system", "rdf schema", "rdf xml"], "abstract": "RDF data are traditionally accessed using structured query languages, such as SPARQL. However, this requires users to understand the language as well as the RDF schema. Keyword search on RDF data aims at relieving the user from these requirements; the user only inputs a set of keywords and the goal is to find small RDF subgraphs which contain all keywords. At the same time, popular RDF knowledge bases also include spatial semantics, which opens the road to location-based search operations. In this work, we propose and study a novel location-based keyword search query on RDF data. The objective of top-k relevant semantic places (kSP) retrieval is to find RDF subgraphs which contain the query keywords and are rooted at spatial entities close to the query location. The novelty of kSP queries is that they are location-aware and that they do not rely on the use of structured query languages. We design a basic method for the processing of kSP queries. To further accelerate kSP retrieval, two pruning approaches and a data preprocessing technique are proposed. Extensive empirical studies on two real datasets demonstrate the superior and robust performance of our proposals compared to the basic method.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "Shenzhen University", "University of Ioannina"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jieming Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jieming", "Dingming Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Dingming", "Nikos Mamoulis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mamoulis:Nikos"], "pages": 14}
