Our formative research revealed numerous ways to provide serendipitous and task-critical information for both sighted and visually impaired users as they navigate through an urban environment on foot. Based on this, we developed a prototype system comprised of the following: an unobtrusive mobile device to present the user with contextual information; a socially maintained online database containing information about POIs; software that is accessible via both a graphical and a speech user interface; and location \"tags\" to be detected by the unobtrusive device. This socially maintained urban orientation and contextual information system offers relevant, dynamic, and up-to-date information, a combination which may not otherwise be accessible.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Jason Stewart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stewart:Jason", "Sara Bauman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauman:Sara", "Michelle Escobar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Escobar:Michelle", "Jakob Hilden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hilden:Jakob", "Kumud Bihani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bihani:Kumud", "Mark W.
