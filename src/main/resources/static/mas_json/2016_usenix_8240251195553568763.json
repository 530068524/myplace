When applications execute in multiple geographic regions, coordination service deployments trade-off between performance, (achieved by using independent services in separate regions), and consistency.\n\nWe present a system design for modular composition of services that addresses this trade-off. We implement ZooNet, a prototype of this concept over ZooKeeper. ZooNet allows users to compose multiple instances of the service in a consistent fashion, facilitating applications that execute in multiple regions. In ZooNet, clients that access only local data suffer no performance penalty compared to working with a standard single ZooKeeper. Clients that use remote and local ZooKeepers show up to 7x performance improvement compared to consistent solutions available today.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Google"], "authors": ["Kfir Lev-Ari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lev=Ari:Kfir", "Edward Bortnikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bortnikov:Edward", "Idit Keidar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keidar:Idit", "Alexander Shraer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shraer:Alexander"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
