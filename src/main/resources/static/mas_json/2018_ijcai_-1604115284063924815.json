{"title": "An Operational Semantics for a Fragment of PRS.", "fields": ["expressive power", "centrality", "formal semantics", "operational semantics", "procedural reasoning system"], "abstract": "The Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) is arguably the \ufb01rst implementation of the Belief\u2013Desire\u2013Intention (BDI) approach to agent programming. PRS remains extremely in\ufb02uential, directly or indirectly inspiring the development of subsequent BDI agent programming languages. However, perhaps surprisingly given its centrality in the BDI paradigm, PRS lacks a formal operational semantics, making it dif\ufb01cult to determine its expressive power relative to other agent programming languages. This paper takes a \ufb01rst step towards closing this gap, by giving a formal semantics for a signi\ufb01cant fragment of PRS. We prove key properties of the semantics relating to PRS-speci\ufb01c programming constructs, and show that even the fragment of PRS we consider is strictly more expressive than the plan constructs found in typical BDI languages.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Nottingham", "Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Lavindra de Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silva:Lavindra_de", "Felipe Meneguzzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meneguzzi:Felipe", "Brian Logan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Logan:Brian"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
