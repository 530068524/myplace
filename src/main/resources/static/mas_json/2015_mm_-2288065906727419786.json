It has a wide range of real-world applications, including cross-platform event analysis, cross-domain multi-event tracking, cross-domain video recommendation, etc. It is also very challenging because the data have multi-modal and multi-domain properties, and there are no explicit correlations to link different domains. To deal with these issues, we propose a generic Cross-Domain Collaborative Learning (CDCL) framework based on non-parametric Bayesian dictionary learning model for cross-domain data analysis. In the proposed CDCL model, it can make use of the shared domain priors and modality priors to collaboratively learn the data's representations by considering the domain discrepancy and the multi-modal property. As a result, our CDCL model can effectively explore the virtues of different information sources to complement and enhance each other for cross-domain data analysis. To evaluate the proposed model, we apply it for two different applications: cross-platform event recognition and cross-network video recommendation. The extensive experimental evaluations well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for cross-domain data analysis.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Hefei University of Technology", "National Lab of ...
