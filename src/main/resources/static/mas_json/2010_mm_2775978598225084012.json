We propose a novel clustering based filtering method to filter those junk images. Firstly we apply K-way min-max cut to cluster images returned by Google into multiple clusters based on the mixture of feature kernels, with kernel weights being determined automatically instead of hard fix. Secondly we select the best cluster in a robust way, and rank all the rest clusters according to their similarity with the best one. Finally those low-rank clusters can be filtered out as junk clusters. In experiments we obtain very comparative filtering performance to the current state-of-the-art, and improve Google Images search results significantly.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Feng Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Feng", "Yi Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yi", "Xiaofei He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaofei"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
