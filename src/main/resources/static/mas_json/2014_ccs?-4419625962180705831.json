{"title": "A Critical Evaluation of Website Fingerprinting Attacks.", "fields": ["base rate fallacy", "false positive paradox", "adversary", "internet privacy", "bundle"], "abstract": "Recent studies on Website Fingerprinting (WF) claim to have found highly effective attacks on Tor. However, these studies make assumptions about user settings, adversary capabilities, and the nature of the Web that do not necessarily hold in practical scenarios. The following study critically evaluates these assumptions by conducting the attack where the assumptions do not hold. We show that certain variables, for example, user's browsing habits, differences in location and version of Tor Browser Bundle, that are usually omitted from the current WF model have a significant impact on the efficacy of the attack. We also empirically show how prior work succumbs to the base rate fallacy in the open-world scenario. We address this problem by augmenting our classification method with a verification step. We conclude that even though this approach reduces the number of false positives over 63\\%, it does not completely solve the problem, which remains an open issue for WF attacks.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "University of California, Berkeley", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "Drexel University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Marc Ju\u00e1rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ju=aacute=rez:Marc", "Sadia Afroz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Afroz:Sadia", "Gunes Acar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acar:Gunes", "Claudia D\u00edaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/D=iacute=az:Claudia", "Rachel Greenstadt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenstadt:Rachel"], "pages": 12}
