{"title": "A pattern framework driven by the Hamming distance for structured light-based reconstruction with a single image.", "fields": ["hamming bound", "structured light", "hamming code", "perfect map", "depth of field"], "abstract": "Structured light based patterns provide a means to capture the state of an object shape. However it may be inefficient when the object is freely moving, when its surface contains high curvature parts or in out of depth of field situations. For image-based robotic guidance in unstructured and dynamic environment, only one shot is required for capturing the shape of a moving region-of-interest. Then robust patterns and real-time capabilities must be targeted. To this end, we have developed a novel technique for the generation of coded patterns directly driven by the Hamming distance. The counterpart is the big amount of codes the coding/decoding algorithms have to face with a high desired Hamming distance. We show that the mean Hamming distance is a useful criterion for driving the patterns generation process and we give a way to predict its value. Furthermore, to ensure local uniqueness of codewords with consideration of many incomplete ones, the Perfect Map theory is involved. Then, we describe a pseudorandom/exhaustive algorithm to build patterns with more than 200\u00d7200 features, in a very short time, thanks to a splitting strategy which performs the Hamming tests in the codeword space instead of the pattern array. This leads to a significant reduction of the computational complexity and it may be applied to other purposes. Finally, real-time reconstructions from single images are reported and results are compared to the best known which are outperformed in many cases.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Strasbourg", "University of Strasbourg", "University of Strasbourg"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xavier Maurice.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maurice:Xavier", "Pierre Graebling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Graebling:Pierre", "Christophe Doignon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doignon:Christophe"], "pages": 8}
