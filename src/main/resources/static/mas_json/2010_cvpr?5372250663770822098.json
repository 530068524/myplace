However, in real environment, appearance changes of individuals due to viewing angle changes cause many difficulties for gait recognition. This paper re-formulates this problem as a regression problem. A novel solution is proposed to create a View Transformation Model (VTM) from the different point of view using Support Vector Regression (SVR). To facilitate the process of regression, a new method is proposed to seek local Region of Interest (ROI) under one viewing angle for predicting the corresponding motion information under another viewing angle. Thus, the well constructed VTM is able to transfer gait information under one viewing angle into another viewing angle. This proposal can achieve view-independent gait recognition. It normalizes gait features under various viewing angles into a common viewing angle before similarity measurement is carried out. The extensive experimental results based on widely adopted benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve significantly better performance than the existing methods in literature.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of Technology, Sydney", "University of New South Wales", "Australian National University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Worapan Kusakunniran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kusakunniran:Worapan", "Qiang Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Qiang", "Jian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Jian", "Hongdong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongdong"], "pages": 8}
