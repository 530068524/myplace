{"title": "Maximum-weighted subset of communication requests schedulable without spectral splitting.", "fields": ["approximation algorithm", "schedule", "channel", "transmission time", "channel allocation schemes"], "abstract": "Consider a set of point-to-point communication requests in a multi-channel multihop wireless network, each of which is associated with a traffic demand of at most one unit of transmission time, and a weight representing the utility if its demand is fully met. A subset of requests is said to be schedulable without spectral splitting if they can be scheduled within one unit of time subject to the constraint each request is assigned with a unique channel throughout its transmission. This paper develops efficient and provably good approximation algorithms for finding a maximum-weighted subset of communication requests schedulable without spectral splitting.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dongguan University of Technology", "Dongguan University of Technology", "City University of Hong Kong", "Tsinghua University", "State University of New York at Oneonta"], "authors": ["Peng-Jun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Peng=Jun", "Huaqiang Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Huaqiang", "Xiaohua Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Xiaohua", "Jiliang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jiliang", "Zhu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
