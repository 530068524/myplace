As a result, requirements for these systems become more comprehensive and complicated. In this setting, requirements engineers struggle to capture consistent and complete requirements of high quality. We propose a feedback-centric requirements editor to help analysts controlling the information overload. Our HeRA tool provides analysts with important data from various feedback facilities. The feedback is directly given based on the input to the editor. On the one hand, it is based on heuristic rules, on the other hand, on automatically derived models. Thus, when new requirements are added, the analyst gets important information on how consistent these requirements are with the existing ones.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Leibniz University of Hanover", "Leibniz University of Hanover", "Leibniz University of Hanover"], "authors": ["Eric Knauss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knauss:Eric", "Daniel L\u00fcbke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=uuml=bke:Daniel", "Sebastian Meyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meyer_0001:Sebastian"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
