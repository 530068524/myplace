Temporal graphs can be used to model many networks with time-related activities, but efficient algorithms for analyzing temporal graphs are severely inadequate. We study fundamental problems such as answering reachability and time-based path queries in a temporal graph, and propose an efficient indexing technique specifically designed for processing these queries in a temporal graph. Our results show that our method is efficient and scalable in both index construction and query processing.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Huanhuan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Huanhuan", "Yuzhen Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Yuzhen", "James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James", "Jinfeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jinfeng", "Yiping Ke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ke:Yiping"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
