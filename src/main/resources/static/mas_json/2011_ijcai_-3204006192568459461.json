Although it has been explored for several decades, most of the studies focus on improving the effectiveness of the problem, i.e., precision and recall. In this paper, we propose to address the efficiency issue, that given a collection of words, how to efficiently discover the top-k most semantic similar words to the query. This issue is very important for real applications yet the existing state-of-the-art strategies cannot satisfy users with reasonable performance. Efficient strategies on searching top-k semantic similar words are proposed. We provide an extensive comparative experimental evaluation demonstrating the advantages of the introduced strategies over the state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhenglu Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zhenglu", "Masaru Kitsuregawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kitsuregawa:Masaru"], "pages": 6}
