The focus in on the constant-bit-rate (CBR) traffic type flows (e.g., VoIP). Our approach is based on the continuous \"selfish\" optimization of resource allocation by each sector. No a priori frequency planning and/or inter-cell coordination is required. We show, both analytically (on a simple illustrative example) and by simulations (of a more realistic system), that the algorithm leads the system to \"self-organize\" into efficient frequency reuse patterns.", "citation": "Citations (231)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Alexander L.
