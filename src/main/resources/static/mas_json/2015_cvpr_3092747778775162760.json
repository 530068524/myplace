The performance of most existing crowd counting methods drops significantly when they are applied to an unseen scene. To address this problem, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for crowd counting, and it is trained alternatively with two related learning objectives, crowd density and crowd count. This proposed switchable learning approach is able to obtain better local optimum for both objectives. To handle an unseen target crowd scene, we present a data-driven method to finetune the trained CNN model for the target scene. A new dataset including 108 crowd scenes with nearly 200,000 head annotations is introduced to better evaluate the accuracy of cross-scene crowd counting methods. Extensive experiments on the proposed and another two existing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (231)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Cong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Cong", "Hongsheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongsheng", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang", "Xiaokang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiaokang"], "pages": 9}
