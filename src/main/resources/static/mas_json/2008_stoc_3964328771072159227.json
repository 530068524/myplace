Given as input a weighted graph G=(V,E,w) and a parameter e>0, we produce a weighted subgraph H=(V,~E,~w) of G such that |~E|=O(n log n/e 2 ) and for all vectors x in R V . (1-e) \u2211uv \u2208 E (x(u)-x(v)) 2 w uv \u2264 \u2211uv in ~E(x(u)-x(v)) 2 ~w uv  \u2264 (1+e)\u2211uv \u2208 E(x(u)-x(v)) 2 w uv . This improves upon the sparsifiers constructed by Spielman and Teng, which had O(n log c  n) edges for some large constant c, and upon those of Benczur and Karger, which only satisfied (1) for x in {0,1} V . We conjecture the existence of sparsifiers with O(n) edges, noting that these would generalize the notion of expander graphs, which are constant-degree sparsifiers for the complete graph. A key ingredient in our algorithm is a subroutine of independent interest: a nearly-linear time algorithm that builds a data structure from which we can query the approximate effective resistance between any two vertices in a graph in O(log n) time.", "citation": "Citations (257)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University", "Yale University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Daniel A.
