In this problem, we wish to predict future links in a growing network with the use of the existing network structure. However, most of the existing methods work well only if a significant number of links are already available in the network for the inference process. In many scenarios, the existing network may be too sparse, and may have too few links to enable meaningful learning mechanisms. This paucity of linkage information can be challenging for the link inference problem. However, in many cases, other (more densely linked) networks may be available which show similar linkage structure in terms of underlying attribute information in the nodes. The linkage information in the existing networks can be used in conjunction with the node attribute information in both networks in order to make meaningful link recommendations. Thus, this paper introduces the use of transfer learning methods for performing cross-network link inference. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "IBM", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Guo-Jun Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Guo=Jun", "Charu C.
