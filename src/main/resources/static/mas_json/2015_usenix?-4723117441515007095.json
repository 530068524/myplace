{"title": "Experience with Rules-Based Programming for Distributed, Concurrent, Fault-Tolerant Code.", "fields": ["nondeterministic algorithm", "special case", "complexity management", "information hiding", "polling"], "abstract": "This paper describes how a rules-based approach allowed us to solve a broad class of challenging distributed system problems in the RAMCloud storage system. In the rules-based approach, behavior is described with small sections of code that trigger independently based on system state; this provides a clean separation between the deterministic and nondeterministic parts of an algorithm. To simplify the implementation of rules-based modules, we developed a task abstraction for information hiding and complexity management, pools for grouping tasks and minimizing the cost of rule evaluation, and a polling-based asynchronous RPC system. The rules-based approach is a special case of an event-based state machine, but it encourages a cleaner factoring of code.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Utah", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Ryan Stutsman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stutsman:Ryan", "Collin Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Collin", "John K.
