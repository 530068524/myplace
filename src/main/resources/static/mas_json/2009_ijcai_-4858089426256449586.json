Starting from a density estimation view to clustering problems, we propose two general on-line frameworks. In the first framework, i.e., historical data dependent (HDD), current model distribution is designed to approximate both current and historical data distributions. In the second framework, i.e., historical model dependent (HMD), current model distribution is designed to approximate both current data distribution and historical model distribution. Both frameworks are based on the general exponential family mixture (EFM) model. As a result, all conventional clustering algorithms based on EFMs can be extended to evolutionary setting under the two frameworks. Empirical results validate the two frameworks.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jianwen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jianwen", "Yangqiu Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yangqiu", "Gang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0003:Gang", "Changshui Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Changshui"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
