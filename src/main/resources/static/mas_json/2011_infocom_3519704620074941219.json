In this paper we present TPD, a Tag-based scheme exploiting Path Diversity in a structured P2P network (DLG-Kautz) to satisfy source nodes' requirements. In TPD, nodes with certain property are tagged and routing messages requiring that property are forwarded only to tagged next-hops. The effectiveness of our proposals is demonstrated through theoretical analysis.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National Labora ... a 410073, China"], "authors": ["Yiming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yiming"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
