{"title": "Stop thinking, start tagging: tag semantics emerge from collaborative verbosity.", "fields": ["small set", "communication noise", "semantic similarity", "existential quantification", "folksonomy"], "abstract": "Recent research provides evidence for the presence of emergent semantics in collaborative tagging systems. While several methods have been proposed, little is known about the factors that influence the evolution of semantic structures in these systems. A natural hypothesis is that the quality of the emergent semantics depends on the pragmatics of tagging: Users with certain usage patterns might contribute more to the resulting semantics than others. In this work, we propose several measures which enable a pragmatic differentiation of taggers by their degree of contribution to emerging semantic structures. We distinguish between categorizers, who typically use a small set of tags as a replacement for hierarchical classification schemes, and describers, who are annotating resources with a wealth of freely associated, descriptive keywords. To study our hypothesis, we apply semantic similarity measures to 64 different partitions of a real-world and large-scale folksonomy containing different ratios of categorizers and describers. Our results not only show that \"verbose\" taggers are most useful for the emergence of tag semantics, but also that a subset containing only 40% of the most 'verbose' taggers can produce results that match and even outperform the semantic precision obtained from the whole dataset. Moreover, the results suggest that there exists a causal link between the pragmatics of tagging and resulting emergent semantics. This work is relevant for designers and analysts of tagging systems interested (i) in fostering the semantic development of their platforms, (ii) in identifying users introducing \"semantic noise\", and (iii) in learning ontologies.", "citation": "Citations (130)", "departments": ["Graz University of Technology", "University of Kassel", "University of W\u00fcrzburg", "Graz University of Technology", "University of Kassel"], "authors": ["Christian K\u00f6rner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=rner:Christian", "Dominik Benz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benz:Dominik", "Andreas Hotho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hotho:Andreas", "Markus Strohmaier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strohmaier:Markus", "Gerd Stumme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stumme:Gerd"], "conf": "www", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
