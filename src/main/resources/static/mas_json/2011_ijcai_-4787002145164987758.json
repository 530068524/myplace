We assume that the Bernoulli distributions are correlated. All evidence data comes in the form of successful or failed experiments at different points. Current state-of-the-art methods for expressing a distribution over a continuum of Bernoulli distributions use logistic Gaussian processes or Gaussian copula processes. However, both of these require computationally expensive matrix operations (cubic in the general case). We introduce a more intuitive approach, directly correlating beta distributions by sharing evidence between them according to a kernel function, an approach which has linear time complexity. The approach can easily be extended to multiple outcomes, giving a continuous correlated Dirichlet process, and can be used for both classification and learning the actual probabilities of the Bernoulli distributions. We show results for a number of data sets, as well as a case-study where a mixture of continuous beta processes is used as part of an automated stroke rehabilitation system.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Dundee", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Robby Goetschalckx.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goetschalckx:Robby", "Pascal Poupart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poupart:Pascal", "Jesse Hoey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoey:Jesse"], "pages": 6}
