Unpredictable changes and alterations in their environments can lead an invalid verification results and the decrease of confidence degree of these systems. However, current literature provides little account of addressing the uncertainty in formal verification. To address this problem, the goal of this research is to provide a method based on perturbation analysis for probabilistic model checking of nondeterministic systems which are modelled as Markov Decision Processes. And to apply our expected contributions to ubiquitous systems due to inherent presence of environment uncertainty and their resource limitations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yamilet R.
