{"title": "Graft: A Debugging Tool For Apache Giraph.", "fields": ["debugging", "distributed computing", "vertex", "copying", "database"], "abstract": "We address the problem of debugging programs written for Pregel-like systems. After interviewing Giraph and GPS users, we developed  Graft . Graft supports the debugging cycle that users typically go through: (1) Users describe programmatically the set of vertices they are interested in inspecting. During execution, Graft captures the context information of these vertices across supersteps. (2) Using Graft's GUI, users visualize how the values and messages of the captured vertices change from superstep to superstep,narrowing in suspicious vertices and supersteps. (3) Users replay the exact lines of the code vertex.compute() function that executed for the suspicious vertices and supersteps, by copying code that Graft generates into their development environments' line-by-line debuggers. Graft also has features to construct end-to-end tests for Giraph programs. Graft is open-source and fully integrated into Apache Giraph's main code base.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Semih Salihoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salihoglu:Semih", "Jaeho Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin_0001:Jaeho", "Vikesh Khanna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khanna:Vikesh", "Ba Quan Truong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Truong:Ba_Quan", "Jennifer Widom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Widom:Jennifer"], "pages": 6}
