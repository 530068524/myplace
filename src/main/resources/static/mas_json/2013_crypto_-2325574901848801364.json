Besides the plain cascade, existing works also consider its modification containing key-whitening steps between the invocations of the block cipher, called randomized cascade or XOR-cascade. We contribute to the understanding of the security of these two designs by giving the following attacks and security proofs, assuming an underlying ideal block cipher with key length k and block length n:", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Peter Gazi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gazi:Peter"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 20}
