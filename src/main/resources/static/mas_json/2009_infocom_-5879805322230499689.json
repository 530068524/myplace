{"title": "Distributed Construction of Fault Resilient High Capacity Wireless Networks with Bounded Node Degree.", "fields": ["ring network", "mobile radio", "local algorithm", "network topology", "point to point"], "abstract": "Embodiments described include methods of determining neighboring nodes with which to link a subject node in a wireless communication network. Depending on the network preferences, the links between neighbor nodes and the subject node may include high capacity links or fault resilient high capacity links. The number of neighboring nodes may be as high as ten in a fault resilient high capacity network and five or less for a high capacity network.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "University of Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Yigal Bejerano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bejerano:Yigal", "Qunfeng Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Qunfeng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
