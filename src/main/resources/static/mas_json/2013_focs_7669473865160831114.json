The special case of TSP in bounded-dimensional Euclidean spaces has been a particular focus of research: The celebrated results of Arora [Aro98] and Mitchell [Mit99] - along with subsequent improvements of Rao and Smith [RS98] - demonstrated a polynomial time approximation scheme for this problem, ultimately achieving a runtime of O d,e (n log n). In this paper, we present a linear time approximation scheme for Euclidean TSP, with runtime O d,e (n). This improvement resolves a 15 year old conjecture of Rao and Smith, and matches for Euclidean spaces the bound known for a broad class of planar graphs [Kle08].", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Ariel University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Yair Bartal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartal:Yair", "Lee-Ad Gottlieb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottlieb:Lee=Ad"], "pages": 9}
