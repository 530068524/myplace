{"title": "Ruby on semantic web.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "rdf schema", "semantic web rule language", "sparql", "language primitive"], "abstract": "The impedance mismatch problem that occurs when relational data is being processed by object-oriented (OO) programs, also occurs when OO programs process RDF data, on the Semantic Web. The impedance mismatch problem stems from the inherent differences between RDF and the data model of OO languages. In this paper, we illustrate a solution to this problem. Essentially, we modify an OO language so that RDF individuals become first-class citizens in the language, and objects of the language become first-class citizens in RDF. Three important benefits that follow from this modification are: (1) it becomes natural to use the language as a persistent programming language, (2) the language supports implicit integration of data from multiple data sources, and (3) SPARQL queries and inference can be applied to objects during the run of a program. This demo presents such a modified programming language, namely Ruby on Semantic Web, which is an extension of the Ruby programming language. The demo includes a system, where users can run applications, written in Ruby on Semantic Web, over multiple data sources. In the demo we run code examples. The effects of the execution on the data sources and on the state of the objects in memory are presented visually, in real time.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Vadim Eisenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisenberg:Vadim", "Yaron Kanza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanza:Yaron"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
