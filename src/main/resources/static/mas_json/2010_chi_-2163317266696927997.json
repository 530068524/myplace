{"title": "Understanding usability practices in complex domains.", "fields": ["usability inspection", "usability lab", "component based usability testing", "usability goals", "pluralistic walkthrough"], "abstract": "Although usability methods are widely used for evaluating conventional graphical user interfaces and websites, there is a growing concern that current approaches are inadequate for evaluating complex, domain-specific tools. We interviewed 21 experienced usability professionals, including in-house experts, external consultants, and managers working in a variety of complex domains, and uncovered the challenges commonly posed by domain complexity and how practitioners work around them. We found that despite the best efforts by usability professionals to get familiar with complex domains on their own, the lack of formal domain expertise can be a significant hurdle for carrying out effective usability evaluations. Partnerships with domain experts lead to effective results as long as domain experts are willing to be an integral part of the usability team. These findings suggest that for achieving usability in complex domains, some fundamental educational changes may be needed in the training of usability professionals.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Parmit K.
