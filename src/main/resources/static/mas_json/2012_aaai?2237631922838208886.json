We investigate the task of Nominal Semantic Role Labeling (NSRL) for tweets, which aims to identify predicate-argument structures defined by nominals in tweets. Studies of this task can help fine-grained information extraction and retrieval from tweets. There are two main challenges in this task: 1) The lack of information in a single tweet, rooted in the short and noisy nature of tweets; and 2) recovery of implicit arguments. We propose jointly conducting NSRL on multiple similar tweets using a graphical model, leveraging the redundancy in tweets to tackle these challenges. Extensive evaluations on a human annotated data set demonstrate that our method outperforms two baselines with an absolute gain of 2.7% in F1.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shandong University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Xiaohua Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaohua", "Zhongyang Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Zhongyang", "Furu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Furu", "Ming Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Ming"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
