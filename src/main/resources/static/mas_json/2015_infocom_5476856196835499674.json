{"title": "Fast RFID grouping protocols.", "fields": ["unicast", "filter", "multicast", "bloom filter", "polling"], "abstract": "In RFID systems, the grouping problem is to efficiently group all tags according to a given partition such that tags in the same group will have the same group ID. Unlike previous research on the unicast transmission from a reader to a tag, grouping provides a fundamental mechanism for efficient multicast transmissions and aggregate queries in large RFID-enabled applications. A message can be transmitted to a group of m tags simultaneously in multicast, which improves the efficiency by m times when comparing with unicast. We study fast grouping protocols in large RFID systems. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to tackle this practically important yet uninvestigated problem. We start with a straightforward solution called the Enhanced Polling Grouping (EPG) protocol. We then propose a time-efficient FIltering Grouping (FIG) protocol that uses Bloom filters to remove the costly ID transmissions. We point out the limitation of the Bloom-filter based solution due to its intrinsic false positive problem, which leads to our final ConCurrent Grouping (CCG) protocol. With a drastically different design, CCG is able to outperform FIG by exploiting collisions to inform multiple tags of their group ID simultaneously and by removing any wasteful slots in its frame-based execution. Simulation results demonstrate that our best protocol CCG can reduce the execution time by a factor of 11 when comparing with a baseline polling protocol.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "University of Florida", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Jia Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0008:Jia", "Bin Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao_0001:Bin", "Shigang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shigang", "Feng Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0003:Feng", "Lijun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0006:Lijun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
