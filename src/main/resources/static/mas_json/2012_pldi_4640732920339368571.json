They do not provide information about why the program spends those resources or about how resource consumption  would change  for different program inputs. In this paper we introduce the idea of  algorithmic profiling . While a traditional profiler determines a set of measured cost  values , an algorithmic profiler determines a cost  function . It does that by automatically determining the \"inputs\" of a program, by measuring the program's \"cost\" for any given input, and by inferring an empirical cost function.", "citation": "Citations (78)", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Lugano"], "authors": ["Dmitrijs Zaparanuks.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaparanuks:Dmitrijs", "Matthias Hauswirth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hauswirth:Matthias"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
