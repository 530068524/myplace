{"title": "CodePilot: Scaffolding End-to-End Collaborative Software Development for Novice Programmers.", "fields": ["software development", "installation", "situation awareness", "pair programming", "impromptu"], "abstract": "Novice programmers often have trouble installing, configuring, and managing disparate tools (e.g., version control systems, testing infrastructure, bug trackers) that are required to become productive in a modern collaborative software development environment. To lower the barriers to entry into software development, we created a prototype IDE for novices called CodePilot, which is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to integrate coding, testing, bug reporting, and version control management into a real-time collaborative system. CodePilot enables multiple users to connect to a web-based programming session and work together on several major phases of software development. An eight-subject exploratory user study found that first-time users of CodePilot spontaneously used it to assume roles such as developer/tester and developer/assistant when creating a web application together in pairs. Users felt that CodePilot could aid in scaffolding for novices, situational awareness, and lowering barriers to impromptu collaboration.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jeremy Warner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Warner:Jeremy", "Philip J.
