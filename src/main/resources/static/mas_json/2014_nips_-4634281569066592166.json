Our approach fits naturally into the kernel framework and can be interpreted as constructing new data-dependent kernels, which we call Fredholm kernels. We proceed to discuss the \"noise assumption\" for semi-supervised learning and provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that Fredholm kernels can effectively utilize unlabeled data under the noise assumption. We demonstrate that methods based on Fredholm learning show very competitive performance in the standard semi-supervised learning setting.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Qichao Que.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Que:Qichao", "Mikhail Belkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belkin:Mikhail", "Yusu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yusu"], "pages": 9}
