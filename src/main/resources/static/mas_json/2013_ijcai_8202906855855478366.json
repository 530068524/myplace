The former is supported with respect to constant and variable domain semantics. In addition, a sound and complete embedding of this framework in classical higher-order logic is presented. Using prominent examples from the literature it is demonstrated how this embedding enables effective automation of reasoning within (object-level) and about (meta-level) quantified conditional logics with off-the-shelf higher-order theorem provers and model finders.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Free University of Berlin"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Christoph Benzmueller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benzmueller:Christoph"], "pages": 8}
