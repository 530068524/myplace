{"title": "VisualCloud Demonstration: A DBMS for Virtual Reality.", "fields": ["fidelity", "virtual reality", "data transmission", "array dbms", "in memory database"], "abstract": "We demonstrate VisualCloud, a database management system designed to efficiently ingest, store, and deliver virtual reality (VR) content at scale. VisualCloud targets both live and prerecorded spherical panoramic (a.k.a. 360\u00b0) VR videos. It persists content as a multidimensional array that utilizes both dense (e.g., space and time) and sparse (e.g., bitrate) dimensions. VisualCloud uses orientation prediction to reduce data transfer by degrading out-of-view portions of the video. Content delivered through VisualCloud requires up to 60% less bandwidth than existing methods and scales to many concurrent connections.   This demonstration will allow attendees to view both live and prerecorded VR video content served through VisualCloud. Viewers will be able to dynamically adjust tuning parameters (e.g., bitrates and path prediction) and observe changes in visual fidelity.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Brandon Haynes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haynes:Brandon", "Artem Minyaylov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minyaylov:Artem", "Magdalena Balazinska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balazinska:Magdalena", "Luis Ceze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceze:Luis", "Alvin Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Alvin"], "pages": 4}
