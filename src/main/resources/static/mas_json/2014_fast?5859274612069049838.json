In this work, we developed multi-version B-tree with lazy split (LS-MVBT) to effectively address the Journaling of Journal anomaly in Android I/O. LS-MVBT is carefully crafted to minimize the write traffic caused by fsync() call of SQLite. The contribution of LS-MVBT consists of two key elements: (i) Multi-version B-tree effectively reduces \"the number of fsync() calls\" via weaving the crash recovery information within the database itself instead of maintaining a separate file, and (ii) it significantly reduces \"the number of dirty pages to be synchronized in a single fsync() call\" via optimizing the multi-version B-tree for Android I/O. The optimization of multi-version B-tree consists of three elements: lazy split, metadata embedding, and disabling sibling redistribution. We implemented LS-MVBT in Samsung Galaxy S4 with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. The results are impressive. For SQLite, the LS-MVBT exhibits 70% (704 insertions/sec vs. 416 insertions/sec), and 1,220% performance improvement against WAL mode and TRUNCATE mode (704 insertions/sec vs. 55 insertions/sec), respectively.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Hanyang University", "Hanyang University"], "authors": ["Wook-Hee Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Wook=Hee", "Beomseok Nam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nam:Beomseok", "Dongil Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Dongil", "Youjip Won.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Won:Youjip"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2014", "pages": 13}
