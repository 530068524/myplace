We achieve this by leveraging the illumination variations captured in Internet photo-collections. In order to depict and characterize the illumination spectrum of a scene, our method relies on building discrete representations of the image appearance space through connectivity graphs defined over a pairwise image distance function. The smooth appearance transitions are found as the shortest path in the similarity graph among images, and robust image alignment is achieved by leveraging scene semantics, multi-view geometry, and image warping techniques. The attained results present an insightful and compact visualization of the scene illuminations captured in crowd-sourced imagery.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Dinghuang Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Dinghuang", "Enrique Dunn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dunn:Enrique", "Jan-Michael Frahm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frahm:Jan=Michael"], "pages": 9}
