While various IM techniques proposed over the last decade have definitely enriched the field, unfortunately, experimental reports on existing techniques fall short in validity and integrity since many comparisons are not based on a common platform or merely discussed in theory. In this paper, we perform an in-depth benchmarking study of  IM  techniques on social networks. Specifically, we design a benchmarking platform, which enables us to evaluate and compare the existing techniques systematically and thoroughly under identical experimental conditions. Our benchmarking results analyze and diagnose the inherent deficiencies of the existing approaches and surface the open challenges in  IM  even after a decade of research. More fundamentally, we unearth and debunk a series of myths and establish that there is no single state-of-the-art technique in IM. At best, a technique is the state of the art in only one aspect.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Xerox", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Akhil Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora_0001:Akhil", "Sainyam Galhotra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galhotra:Sainyam", "Sayan Ranu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranu:Sayan"], "pages": 16}
