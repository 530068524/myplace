Our model is a tree-structured mixture of potentially exponentially many stochastic blockmodels. We describe a family of greedy agglomerative model selection algorithms that take just one pass through the data to learn a fully probabilistic, hierarchical community model. In the worst case, Our algorithms scale quadratically in the number of vertices of the network, but independent of the number of nested communities. In practice, the run time of our algorithms are two orders of magnitude faster than the Infinite Relational Model, achieving comparable or better accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University College London", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Charles Blundell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blundell:Charles", "Yee Whye Teh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teh:Yee_Whye"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
