However, the workers' performance might deteriorate due to stress. We argue that informing biofeedback to the instructor, can improve communication and lead to lower stress. This paper presents a thorough investigation on mental workload and stress perceived by twenty participants, paired up in an instructor-worker scenario, performing remote video-mediated tasks. The interface conditions differ in task, facial and biofeedback communication. Two self-report measures are used to assess mental workload and stress. Results show that pairs reported lower mental workload and stress when instructors are using the biofeedback as compared to using interfaces with facial view. Significant correlations were found on task performance with reducing stress (i.e. increased task engagement and decreased worry) for instructors and declining mental workload (i.e. increased performance) for workers. Our findings provide insights to advance video-mediated interfaces for remote collaborative work.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Hasselt", "University of Hasselt", "University of Hasselt", "University of Hasselt"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chiew Seng Sean Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chiew_Seng_Sean", "Johannes Sch\u00f6ning.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=ning:Johannes", "Kris Luyten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luyten:Kris", "Karin Coninx.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coninx:Karin"], "pages": 10}
