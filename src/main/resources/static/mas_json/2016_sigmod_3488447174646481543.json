{"title": "Functional Dependencies for Graphs.", "fields": ["functional dependency", "graph", "special case", "synthetic data", "scalability"], "abstract": "We propose a class of functional dependencies for graphs, referred to as GFDs. GFDs capture both attribute-value dependencies and topological structures of entities, and subsume conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) as a special case. We show that the satisfiability and implication problems for GFDs are coNP-complete and NP-complete, respectively, no worse than their CFD counterparts. We also show that the validation problem for GFDs is coNP-complete. Despite the intractability, we develop parallel scalable algorithms for catching violations of GFDs in large-scale graphs. Using real-life and synthetic data, we experimentally verify that GFDs provide an effective approach to detecting inconsistencies in knowledge and social graphs.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Washington State University", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Wenfei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Wenfei", "Yinghui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yinghui", "Jingbo Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jingbo"], "pages": 15}
