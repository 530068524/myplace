In contrast, we argue that selectively concealing whose movement controls which representation can facilitate engaging play experiences. We call this \"innominate movement representation\" and explore this opportunity through our game \"i-dentity\", where players have to guess who makes everyone's controller light up based on his/her movements. Our work reveals five dimensions for the design of innominate movement representation: concealing the association between movement and representation; number of represented movements; number of players with representations; location of representation in relation to the body and technical attributes of representation. We also present five strategies for how innominate representation can be embedded into a play experience. With our work we hope to expand the range of digital movement games.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["RMIT University", "Newcastle University", "RMIT University", "University of Salzburg", "RMIT University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jayden Garner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garner:Jayden", "Gavin Wood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wood:Gavin", "Sebastiaan Pijnappel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pijnappel:Sebastiaan", "Martin Murer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murer:Martin", "Florian Mueller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mueller_0001:Florian"], "pages": 10}
