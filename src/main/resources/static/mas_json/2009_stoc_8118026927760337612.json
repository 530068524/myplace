Prior cryptosystems with worst-case connections were based either on the shortest vector problem for a  special class  of lattices (Ajtai and Dwork, STOC 1997; Regev, J. ACM 2004), or on the conjectured hardness of lattice problems for  quantum  algorithms (Regev, STOC 2005). Our main technical innovation is a reduction from variants of the shortest vector problem to corresponding versions of the \"learning with errors\" (LWE) problem; previously, only a  quantum  reduction of this kind was known. As an additional contribution, we construct a natural  chosen ciphertext-secure  cryptosystem having a much simpler description and tighter underlying worst-case approximation factor than prior schemes.", "citation": "Citations (585)", "departments": ["SRI International"], "authors": ["Chris Peikert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peikert:Chris"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
