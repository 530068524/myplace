{"title": "Life scheduling to support multiple social roles.", "fields": ["collaborative software", "scheduling", "personally identifiable information", "knowledge management", "schedule"], "abstract": "We present the results of our study of 15 working parents, and how they manage their  life scheduling  needs, that is, how they manage their personal and professional schedules across settings and calendaring tools. In particular, we discuss how their dual roles of parent and employee compel them to record personal information on their professional calendars and we detail the tensions that arise in doing so. Finally, we present suggestions for future calendaring applications that better support working parents in managing their life scheduling needs.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Andrea Grimes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grimes:Andrea", "A.
