{"title": "Characterizing Question Facets for Complex Answer Retrieval.", "fields": ["facet", "ranking", "data mining", "architecture", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Complex answer retrieval (CAR) is the process of retrieving answers to questions that have multifaceted or nuanced answers. In this work, we present two novel approaches for CAR based on the observation that question facets can vary in utility: from structural (facets that can apply to many similar topics, such as 'History') to topical (facets that are specific to the question's topic, such as the 'Westward expansion' of the United States). We first explore a way to incorporate facet utility into ranking models during query term score combination. We then explore a general approach to reform the structure of ranking models to aid in learning of facet utility in the query-document term matching phase. When we use our techniques with a leading neural ranker on the TREC CAR dataset, our methods yield statistically significant improvements over both an unmodified neural architecture and submitted TREC runs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Georgetown University", "Max Planck Society", "Georgetown University", "Georgetown University", "SAP SE, Berlin, Germany"], "authors": ["Sean MacAvaney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/MacAvaney:Sean", "Andrew Yates.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yates:Andrew", "Arman Cohan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohan:Arman", "Luca Soldaini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soldaini:Luca", "Kai Hui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hui:Kai", "Nazli Goharian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goharian:Nazli", "Ophir Frieder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frieder:Ophir"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
