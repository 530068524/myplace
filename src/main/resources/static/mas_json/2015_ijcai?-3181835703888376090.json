{"title": "Regularizing Flat Latent Variables with Hierarchical Structures.", "fields": ["data set", "hierarchy", "hierarchical clustering", "topic model", "latent variable"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a stratified topic model (STM). Instead of directly modeling and inferring flat topics or hierarchically structured topics, we use the stratified relationships in topic hierarchies to regularize the flat topics. The topic structures are captured by a hierarchical clustering method and play as constraints during the learning process. We propose two theoretically sound and practical inference methods to solve the model. Experimental results with two real world data sets and various evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "Hefei University of Technology", "Nanjing University of Finance and Economics", "Institute for I ... ocomm Research"], "authors": ["Rongcheng Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Rongcheng", "Huayu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Huayu", "Xiaojun Quan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quan:Xiaojun", "Richang Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong:Richang", "Zhiang Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Zhiang", "Yong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Yong"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
