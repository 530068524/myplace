{"title": "Fast Matrix Multiplication: Limitations of the Coppersmith-Winograd Method.", "fields": ["coppersmith winograd algorithm", "matrix", "matrix multiplication", "conjecture", "tensor"], "abstract": "Until a few years ago, the fastest known matrix multiplication algorithm, due to Coppersmith and Winograd (1990), ran in time O(n 2.3755 ). Recently, a surge of activity by Stothers, Vassilevska-Williams, and Le~Gall has led to an improved algorithm running in time O(n 2.3729 ). These algorithms are obtained by analyzing higher and higher tensor powers of a certain identity of Coppersmith and Winograd. We show that this exact approach cannot result in an algorithm with running time O(n 2.3725 ), and identify a wide class of variants of this approach which cannot result in an algorithm with running time $O(n^{2.3078}); in particular, this approach cannot prove the conjecture that for every e > 0, two n x n matrices can be multiplied in time O(n 2+e ).   We describe a new framework extending the original laser method, which is the method underlying the previously mentioned algorithms. Our framework accommodates the algorithms by Coppersmith and Winograd, Stothers, Vassilevska-Williams and Le~Gall. We obtain our main result by analyzing this framework. The framework also explains why taking tensor powers of the Coppersmith--Winograd identity results in faster algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Latvia", "Institute for Advanced Study", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Andris Ambainis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ambainis:Andris", "Yuval Filmus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filmus:Yuval", "Fran\u00e7ois Le Gall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gall:Fran=ccedil=ois_Le"], "pages": 9}
