{"title": "Resilient die-stacked DRAM caches.", "fields": ["checksum", "dirty data", "cache", "cas latency", "bit error rate"], "abstract": "Die-stacked DRAM can provide large amounts of in-package, high-bandwidth cache storage. For server and high-performance computing markets, however, such DRAM caches must also provide sufficient support for reliability and fault tolerance. While conventional off-chip memory provides ECC support by adding one or more extra chips, this may not be practical in a 3D stack. In this paper, we present a DRAM cache organization that uses error-correcting codes (ECCs), strong checksums (CRCs), and dirty data duplication to detect  and  correct a wide range of stacked DRAM failures, from traditional bit errors to large-scale row, column, bank, and channel failures. With only a modest performance degradation compared to a DRAM cache with no ECC support, our proposal can correct all single-bit failures, and 99.9993% of all row, column, and bank failures, providing more than a 54,000x improvement in the FIT rate of silent-data corruptions compared to basic SECDED ECC protection.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "RAS Architectur ... , Devices, Inc."], "conf": "isca", "authors": ["Jaewoong Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Jaewoong", "Gabriel H.
