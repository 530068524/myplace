Using recordings from a single, low-resolution room overview camera and a single far-field microphone, a state-of-the art audio-only speaker localization system (traditionally called speaker diarization) is extended so that both acoustic and visual models are estimated as part of a joint unsupervised optimization problem. The speaker diarization system first automatically determines the number of speakers and estimates \"who spoke when\", then, in a second step, the visual models are used to infer the location of the speakers in the video. The experiments were performed on real-world meetings using 4.5 hours of the publicly available AMI meeting corpus. The proposed system is able to exploit audio-visual integration to not only improve the accuracy of a state-of-the-art (audio-only) speaker diarization, but also adds visual speaker locationing at little incremental engineering and computation costs.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["International Computer Science Institute", "University of California, Berkeley", "Idiap Research Institute"], "authors": ["Gerald Friedland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedland:Gerald", "Chuohao Yeo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeo:Chuohao", "Hayley Hung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hung:Hayley"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
