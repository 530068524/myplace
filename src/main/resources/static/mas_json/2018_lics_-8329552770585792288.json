A direct corollary of this result is the equivalence of the notions of CMSO1-definability and recognizability on graphs of bounded linear cliquewidth.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "RWTH Aachen University", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Mikolaj Bojanczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bojanczyk:Mikolaj", "Martin Grohe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grohe:Martin", "Michal Pilipczuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilipczuk:Michal"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
