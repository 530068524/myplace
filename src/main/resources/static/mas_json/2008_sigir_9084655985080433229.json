{"title": "TF-IDF uncovered: a study of theories and probabilities.", "fields": ["relevance feedback", "odds", "analogy", "disjoint sets", "tf idf"], "abstract": "Interpretations of TF-IDF are based on binary independence retrieval, Poisson, information theory, and language modelling. This paper contributes a review of existing interpretations, and then, TF-IDF is systematically related to the probabilities  P ( q | d ) and  P ( d | q ). Two approaches are explored: a space of  independent , and a space of  disjoint  terms. For  independent  terms, an \"extreme\" query/non-query term assumption uncovers TF-IDF, and an analogy of  P ( d | q ) and the probabilistic odds  O ( r | d ,  q ) mirrors relevance feedback. For  disjoint  terms, a relationship between probability theory and TF-IDF is established through the integral + 1/ x  d x  = log  x . This study uncovers components such as divergence from randomness and pivoted document length to be inherent parts of a document-query independence (DQI) measure, and interestingly, an integral of the DQI over the term occurrence probability leads to TF-IDF.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "Queen Mary University of London"], "authors": ["Thomas Roelleke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roelleke:Thomas", "Jun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0032:Jun"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
