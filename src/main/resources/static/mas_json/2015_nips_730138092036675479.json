On target densities where classical HMC is not an option due to intractable gradients, KMC adaptively learns the target's gradient structure by fitting an exponential family model in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Computational costs are reduced by two novel efficient approximations to this gradient. While being asymptotically exact, KMC mimics HMC in terms of sampling efficiency, and offers substantial mixing improvements over state-of-the-art gradient free samplers. We support our claims with experimental studies on both toy and real-world applications, including Approximate Bayesian Computation and exact-approximate MCMC.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University College London", "University of Oxford", "University of Bristol", "University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Heiko Strathmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strathmann:Heiko", "Dino Sejdinovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sejdinovic:Dino", "Samuel Livingstone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Livingstone:Samuel", "Zolt\u00e1n Szab\u00f3.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Szab=oacute=_0001:Zolt=aacute=n", "Arthur Gretton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gretton:Arthur"], "pages": 9}
