Nevertheless, it is challenging to theoretically frame the variety of digital or immaterial, and physical materials. In order to contribute to this materiality discourse, we reflect on McLuhan's work on media analysis and on Latour's Actor-Network Theory in this paper. Both emphasize the  active role of the material  - be it media or any other kind of non-human actors - in the interplay with the human. Thus, we establish junctures between their findings and materials, as used in interaction design in HCI. We discuss McLuhan's claim to focus on new sensory effects and ways of interaction brought forth by new media. Furthermore, we illustrate how describing the connections between materials, designers, and users in terms of Latour's Actor-Networks can be beneficial for interaction design. Finally, we discuss the respective methodology and its relation to research through design.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg", "University of Salzburg"], "authors": ["Verena Fuchsberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuchsberger:Verena", "Martin Murer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murer:Martin", "Manfred Tscheligi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tscheligi:Manfred"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
