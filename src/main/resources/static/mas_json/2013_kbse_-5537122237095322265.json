In most cases, developers must be able to reproduce a reported failure using only a stack trace and/or some informal description of the failure. The problem becomes even harder for the large class of programs whose input is highly structured and strictly specified by a grammar. To address this problem, we present SBFR, a search-based failure-reproduction technique for programs with structured input. SBFR formulates failure reproduction as a search problem. Starting from a reported failure and a limited amount of dynamic information about the failure, SBFR exploits the potential of genetic programming to iteratively find legal inputs that can trigger the failure.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["fondazione bruno kessler", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "fondazione bruno kessler", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "fondazione bruno kessler"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Fitsum Meshesha Kifetew.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kifetew:Fitsum_Meshesha", "Wei Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin_0001:Wei", "Roberto Tiella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiella:Roberto", "Alessandro Orso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Orso:Alessandro", "Paolo Tonella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tonella:Paolo"], "pages": 6}
