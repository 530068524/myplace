We show feasibility of our approach by presenting experimental results on the verification of the fuel control system example in the Simulink distribution. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that (exhaustive) verification has been carried out for hybrid systems of such a size.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Toni Mancini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mancini:Toni", "Federico Mari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mari:Federico", "Annalisa Massini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Massini:Annalisa", "Igor Melatti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Melatti:Igor", "Fabio Merli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Merli:Fabio", "Enrico Tronci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tronci:Enrico"], "pages": 17}
