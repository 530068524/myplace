{"title": "ActivityNet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "object detection", "benchmark", "spite", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "In spite of many dataset efforts for human action recognition, current computer vision algorithms are still severely limited in terms of the variability and complexity of the actions that they can recognize. This is in part due to the simplicity of current benchmarks, which mostly focus on simple actions and movements occurring on manually trimmed videos. In this paper we introduce ActivityNet, a new large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding. Our benchmark aims at covering a wide range of complex human activities that are of interest to people in their daily living. In its current version, ActivityNet provides samples from 203 activity classes with an average of 137 untrimmed videos per class and 1.41 activity instances per video, for a total of 849 video hours. We illustrate three scenarios in which ActivityNet can be used to compare algorithms for human activity understanding: untrimmed video classification, trimmed activity classification and activity detection.", "citation": "Citations (312)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Universidad del Norte, Colombia", "Universidad del Norte, Colombia", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "Universidad del Norte, Colombia"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Fabian Caba Heilbron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heilbron:Fabian_Caba", "Victor Escorcia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Escorcia:Victor", "Bernard Ghanem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghanem:Bernard", "Juan Carlos Niebles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niebles:Juan_Carlos"], "pages": 10}
