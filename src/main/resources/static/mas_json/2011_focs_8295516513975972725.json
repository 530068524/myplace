In many of the models, a group of people in a social network, each holding a numerical opinion, arrive at a shared opinion through repeated averaging with their neighbors in the network. Motivated by the observation that in reality consensus is rarely reached, we study a related sociological model in which individuals' intrinsic beliefs counterbalance the averaging process and yield a diversity of opinions.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Microsoft", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["David Bindel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bindel:David", "Jon M.
