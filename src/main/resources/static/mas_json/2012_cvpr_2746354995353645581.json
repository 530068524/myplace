In the nonrigid ICP framework, a template surface is represented by a set of points, and the shape of the template is parametrized by a transformation matrix per one template point. In the proposed method, the statistics of the matrices are estimated based on a set of training surfaces, and the statistical shape model is incorporated into the nonrigid ICP framework by modifying the representation of the stiffness of the template. The statistical shape model and a noise model make it possible to discriminate outliers from inliers in given targets. Our proposed method detects the outliers, which are not represented by the models appropriately, based on their sparseness. The detected outliers are automatically excluded from the target to be registered, and the template is deformed to fit the inliers only. As the result, the accuracy of the registration is improved. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using synthetic data and clinical CT images.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hidekata Hontani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hontani:Hidekata", "Takamiti Matsuno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsuno:Takamiti", "Yoshihide Sawada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sawada:Yoshihide"], "pages": 8}
