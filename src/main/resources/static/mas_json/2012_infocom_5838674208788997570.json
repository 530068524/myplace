{"title": "Cooperative cognitive radio networking using quadrature signaling.", "fields": ["throughput", "cognitive radio", "maximization", "relay", "phase shift keying"], "abstract": "A quadrature signaling based two-phase cooperation framework for cooperative cognitive radio networking is proposed. By leveraging the degrees of freedom provided by orthogonal modulation, secondary users are able to relay the traffic of primary users and transmit their own in the same time slot without interference. To evaluate the cooperation performance of the proposed framework, a weighted sum throughput maximization problem is formulated, and closed-form solutions of the optimal power setting/allocation are obtained in the amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying modes. Simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed framework.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Princeton University", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Bin Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao_0003:Bin", "Lin X.
