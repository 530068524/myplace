{"title": "Clustering Financial Time Series: How Long Is Enough?.", "fields": ["random variable", "financial models with long tailed distributions and volatility clustering", "cluster analysis", "source data", "spurious relationship"], "abstract": "Researchers have used from 30 days to several years of daily returns as source data for clustering financial time series based on their correlations. This paper sets up a statistical framework to study the validity of such practices. We first show that clustering correlated random variables from their observed values is statistically consistent. Then, we also give a first empirical answer to the much debated question: How long should the time series be? If too short, the clusters found can be spurious; if too long, dynamics can be smoothed out.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "Hellebore Capit ... l Ltd., London"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Gautier Marti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marti:Gautier", "S\u00e9bastien Andler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andler:S=eacute=bastien", "Frank Nielsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nielsen:Frank", "Philippe Donnat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Donnat:Philippe"], "pages": 7}
