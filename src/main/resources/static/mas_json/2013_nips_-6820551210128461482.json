Many state-of-the-art robot learning successes are based MPs, due to their compact representation of the inherently continuous and high dimensional robot movements. A major goal in robot learning is to combine multiple MPs as building blocks in a modular control architecture to solve complex tasks. To this effect, a MP representation has to allow for blending between motions, adapting to altered task variables, and co-activating multiple MPs in parallel. We present a probabilistic formulation of the MP concept that maintains a distribution over trajectories. Our probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of new operations which are essential for implementing all aforementioned properties in one framework. In order to use such a trajectory distribution for robot movement control, we analytically derive a stochastic feedback controller which reproduces the given trajectory distribution. We evaluate and compare our approach to existing methods on several simulated as well as real robot scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Alexandros Paraschos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paraschos:Alexandros", "Christian Daniel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daniel:Christian", "Jan Peters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peters_0001:Jan", "Gerhard Neumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumann:Gerhard"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
