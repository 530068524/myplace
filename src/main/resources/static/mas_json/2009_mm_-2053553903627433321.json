In this paper, we present a face clustering system which automatically groups photos into clusters, with each cluster containing photos of the same person. This is done based on an advanced face recognition engine and a semi-supervised clustering approach. The system achieved good clustering accuracy when tested on different image sets and by different users. Moreover, features such as adding new images, face cluster navigation and face based image retrieval are added that greatly improve the usability of the system. It also facilitates efficient manual manipulations of clustering results. On top of this technology, image navigation systems have been built, including the \"face bubble\" visualization which provides one-glance view of a photo collection, and shows the relations among people.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Tong", "Jun Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Jun", "Di Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Di", "Xiaoqing Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Xiaoqing"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
