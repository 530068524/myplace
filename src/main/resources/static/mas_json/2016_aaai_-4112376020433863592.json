A way to compare them consists in using a ranking-based semantics which rank-order arguments from the most to the least acceptable ones. Recently, a number of such semantics have been proposed independently, often associated with some desirable properties. However, there is no comparative study which takes a broader perspective. This is what we propose in this work. We provide a general comparison of all these semantics with respect to the proposed properties. That allows to underline the differences of behavior between the existing semantics.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Paris Descartes University", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Paris"], "authors": ["Elise Bonzon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonzon:Elise", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delobelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delobelle:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "S\u00e9bastien Konieczny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konieczny:S=eacute=bastien", "Nicolas Maudet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maudet:Nicolas"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
