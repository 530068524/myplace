{"title": "How well do visual verbs work in daily communication for young and old adults?", "fields": ["animation", "verb", "visual communication", "sensory cue", "lexical verb"], "abstract": "In this paper we study how verbs are visually conveyed in daily communication contexts for both young and old adults. Four visual modes are compared: a single static image, a panel of four static images, an animation, and a video clip. The results reveal age effects, as well as performance differences introduced by lexical verb properties and visual cues. We also suggest guidelines for visual verb creation.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Xiaojuan Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiaojuan", "Perry R.
