{"title": "Multi-Agent Path Finding on Strongly Biconnected Digraphs.", "fields": ["block graph", "pathwidth", "longest path problem", "induced path", "pathfinding"], "abstract": "Much of the literature on multi-agent path finding focuses on undirected graphs, where motion is permitted in both directions along a graph edge. Despite this, travelling on directed graphs is relevant in navigation domains, such as pathfinding in games, and asymmetric communication networks.\n\nWe consider multi-agent path finding on strongly biconnected directed graphs. We show that all instances with at least two unoccupied positions can be solved or proven unsolvable. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for this class of problems, and analyze its complexity. Our work may be the first formal study of multi-agent path finding on directed graphs.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["IBM", "Charles University in Prague"], "authors": ["Adi Botea.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Botea:Adi", "Pavel Surynek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Surynek:Pavel"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
