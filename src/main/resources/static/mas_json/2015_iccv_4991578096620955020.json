The detailed spectral resolution is useful for many image analysis problems, but it comes at the cost of much lower spatial resolution. Hyperspectral super-resolution addresses this problem, by fusing a low-resolution hyperspectral image and a conventional high-resolution image into a product of both high spatial and high spectral resolution. In this paper, we propose a method which performs hyperspectral super-resolution by jointly unmixing the two input images into the pure reflectance spectra of the observed materials and the associated mixing coefficients. The formulation leads to a coupled matrix factorisation problem, with a number of useful constraints imposed by elementary physical properties of spectral mixing. In experiments with two benchmark datasets we show that the proposed approach delivers improved hyperspectral super-resolution.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Charis Lanaras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lanaras:Charis", "Emmanuel Baltsavias.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baltsavias:Emmanuel", "Konrad Schindler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schindler:Konrad"], "pages": 9}
