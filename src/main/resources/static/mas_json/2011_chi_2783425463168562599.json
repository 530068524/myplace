{"title": "Side effects and \"gateway\" tools: advocating a broader look at evaluating persuasive systems.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "default gateway", "multimedia", "persuasive technology", "computer science"], "abstract": "This paper argues for evaluating the impact of persuasive systems on users beyond metrics that focus on system usage, based on an interview study of 16 Wii Fit users. While exploring their experiences and reasons for abandoning the system, two main themes emerged: the tension between Wii Fit as a fitness tool and a game, and ways participants reacted to the system's feedback about their weight and performance. Some participants used Wii Fit as a \"gateway fitness\" tool, moving beyond it to other fitness routines. Additionally, some users had significant emotional reactions to the Wii Fitts feedback. We argue that these 'side effects' are crucial considerations for the design and long-term evaluation of persuasive technologies.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Victoria Schwanda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwanda:Victoria", "Steven Ibara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ibara:Steven", "Lindsay Reynolds.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reynolds:Lindsay", "Dan Cosley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cosley:Dan"], "pages": 4}
