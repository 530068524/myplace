While studies have found that users generally prefer personalized search results to non-personalized ones, recent surveys also indicate growing reservations with respect to personalization because of its privacy implications. In this paper, we take a deeper look at privacy considerations of users during web search and explore how users' preferences for privacy and personalization interact when undertaking this activity. We conduct an empirical study over Google search, involving 25 participants in India and their respective web search histories. Our finding is that users exhibit a slight preference for personalization in their search results but are usually willing to \"give up\" personalization when searching for topics they deem sensitive. We discuss implications of these results for the design of privacy-preserving tools for web search.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Saurabh Panjwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panjwani:Saurabh", "Nisheeth Shrivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrivastava:Nisheeth", "Saurabh Shukla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shukla:Saurabh", "Sharad Jaiswal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaiswal:Sharad"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
