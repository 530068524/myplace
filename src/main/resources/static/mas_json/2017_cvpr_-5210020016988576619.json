In this paper, we propose to solve the two tasks jointly for natural multi-person images, in which the estimated pose provides object-level shape prior to regularize part segments while the part-level segments constrain the variation of pose locations. Specifically, we first train two fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), namely Pose FCN and Part FCN, to provide initial estimation of pose joint potential and semantic part potential. Then, to refine pose joint location, the two types of potentials are fused with a fully-connected conditional random field (FCRF), where a novel segment-joint smoothness term is used to encourage semantic and spatial consistency between parts and joints. To refine part segments, the refined pose and the original part potential are integrated through a Part FCN, where the skeleton feature from pose serves as additional regularization cues for part segments. Finally, to reduce the complexity of the FCRF, we induce human detection boxes and infer the graph inside each box, making the inference forty times faster. Since theres no dataset that contains both part segments and pose labels, we extend the PASCAL VOC part dataset [6] with human pose joints and perform extensive experiments to compare our method against several most recent strategies. We show that our algorithm surpasses competing methods by 10.6% in pose estimation with much faster speed and by 1.5% in semantic part segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California", "University of California", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Fangting Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Fangting", "Peng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Peng", "Xianjie Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xianjie", "Alan L.
