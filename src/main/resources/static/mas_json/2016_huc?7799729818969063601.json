Specifically, we show that commodity input devices such as fingerprint sensors and touchpads can be used to transmit information to only wireless receivers that are in contact with the body. We characterize the propagation of the resulting transmissions across the whole body and run experiments with ten subjects to demonstrate that our approach generalizes across different body types and postures. We also evaluate our communication system in the presence of interference from other wearable devices such as smartwatches and nearby metallic surfaces. Finally, by modulating the operations of these input devices, we demonstrate bit rates of up to 50 bits per second over the human body.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Mehrdad Hessar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hessar:Mehrdad", "Vikram Iyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iyer:Vikram", "Shyamnath Gollakota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollakota:Shyamnath"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
