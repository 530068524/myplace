However, past user studies have indicated that this mechanism is counter-productive, as developers spend a significant amount of effort sifting through such feeds looking for items that are relevant to them. We present NeedFeed, a system that models code relevance by mining a project's software repository and highlights changes that a developer may need to review. We evaluate several techniques to model code relevance, from a naive TOUCH-based approach to generic HISTORY-based classifiers using temporal code metrics at file and method-level granularities, which are then improved by building developer-specific models using TEXT-based features from commit messages. NeedFeed reduces notification clutter by more than 90%, on average, with the best strategy giving an average precision and recall of more than 75%.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Rohan Padhye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padhye:Rohan", "Senthil Mani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mani:Senthil", "Vibha Singhal Sinha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sinha:Vibha_Singhal"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
