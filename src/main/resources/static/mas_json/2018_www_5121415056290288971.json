{"title": "\"Satisfaction with Failure\" or \"Unsatisfied Success\": Investigating the Relationship between Search Success and User Satisfaction.", "fields": ["subject matter expert", "credibility", "computer science", "readability", "data mining"], "abstract": "User satisfaction has been paid much attention to in recent Web search evaluation studies. Although satisfaction is often considered as an important symbol of search success, it doesn\u2019t guarantee success in many cases, especially for complex search task scenarios. In this study, we investigate the differences between user satisfaction and search success, and try to adopt the findings to predict search success in complex search tasks. To achieve these research goals, we conduct a laboratory study in which search success and user satisfaction are annotated by domain expert assessors and search users, respectively. We find that both \u201cSatisfaction with Failure\u201d and \u201cUnsatisfied Success\u201d cases happen in these search tasks and together they account for as many as 40.3% of all search sessions. The factors (e.g. document readability and credibility) that lead to the inconsistency of search success and user satisfaction are also investigated and adopted to predict whether one search task is successful. Experimental results show that our proposed prediction method is effective in predicting search success.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Mengyang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Mengyang", "Yiqun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yiqun", "Jiaxin Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Jiaxin", "Cheng Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Cheng", "Min Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Min", "Shaoping Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Shaoping"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
