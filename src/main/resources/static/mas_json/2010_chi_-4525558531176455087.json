Through comparison with a concurrent control trial using an identical game without the enhanced social information, it was shown that the additional contextual data increased the frequency of social activity between players engaged in the game. Despite this increase in activity, there was little increase in growth of the player-base when compared to the control condition. These findings corroborate previous work that showed how socio-contextual enhancement can increase performance on task-driven games, whilst also suggesting that it can increase activity and engagement when provided as context for non task-driven game environments.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["University of Lincoln", "University of Lincoln", "University of Lincoln", "University of Padua", "University of Padua"], "authors": ["Ben Kirman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kirman:Ben", "Shaun W.
