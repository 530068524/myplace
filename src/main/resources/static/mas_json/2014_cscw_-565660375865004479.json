We explore the effects of social, learning, and financial strategies, and their combinations, on increasing worker retention across tasks and change in the quality of worker output. Through three experiments, we show that 1) using these strategies together increased workers' engagement and the quality of their work; 2) a social strategy was most effective for increasing engagement; 3) a learning strategy was most effective in improving quality. The findings of this paper provide strategies for harnessing the crowd to perform complex tasks, as well as insight into crowd workers' motivation.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Lixiu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Lixiu", "Paul Andr\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andr=eacute=:Paul", "Aniket Kittur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kittur:Aniket", "Robert E.
