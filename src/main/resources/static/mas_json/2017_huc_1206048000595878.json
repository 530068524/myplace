It shows upcoming daily schedules and the time through the quiet, ambient motions of a clock hand and light through the concrete touch interface. The results of an in-field user observation of 10 participants over 3 days showed the possibilities of using concrete as a unique and attractive material for designing a tangible interface due to its unexpected haptic feeling. We also found that Quietto provides an intuitive and effective representation of its users' daily schedules and can be used as a private, personal device. Through its distinctive design, Quietto can provide a new way of understanding scheduling through its concrete texture and amusing interaction qualities.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology", "Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Kyung-Ryong Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kyung=Ryong", "Geon-il Goh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goh:Geon=il", "Young Woo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Young_Woo"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
