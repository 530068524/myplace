{"title": "Generating VR Live Videos with Tripod Panoramic Rig.", "fields": ["stereopsis", "panorama", "frame rate", "tripod", "image stitching"], "abstract": "Recent breakthrough in consumer-level virtual reality (VR) devices brings an increasing demand of VR live content. As converting real life content into VR need complex computations, current techniques can not synthesize 360\u00b0 3D VR content with high performance, not to mention real time. We propose an end-to-end system that records a scene using a tripod panoramic rig and broadcasts 360\u00b0 stereo panorama videos in real time. The system performs a panorama stitching technique which pre-compute 3 stitching seam candidates for dynamic seam switching in the live broadcasting. This technique achieves high frame rates (>30fps) with minimum foreground cutoff and temporal jittering artifacts. Stereo vision quality is also better preserved by a proposed weighting-based image alignment scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of videos delivering live events. And our system has been successfully used in broadcasting live shows to mobile phone users on a professional live broadcasting platform with about 390 million user visits per month.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Feng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Feng", "Tianqi Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Tianqi", "Bicheng Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Bicheng", "Qionghai Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Qionghai"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2018", "pages": 5}
