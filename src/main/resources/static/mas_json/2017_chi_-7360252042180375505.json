After the game was launched globally in July 2016, it quickly became the most successful mobile game in both popularity and revenue generation at the time, and the first location-based augmented reality game to reach a mainstream status. We explore the game experiences through a qualitative survey (n=1000) in Finland focusing on the positive and the negative aspects of  Pokemon GO  as told by the players. The positive experiences are related to movement, sociability, game mechanics, and brand while the negative experiences emerge from technical problems, unequal gaming opportunities, bad behavior of other players and non-players, and unpolished game design. Interestingly, the augmented reality features, safety issues or the free-to-play revenue model did not receive considerable feedback. The findings are useful for academics and industry practitioners for studying and designing location-based augmented reality game experiences.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Tampere", "University of Tampere", "University of Tampere", "University of Tampere", "University of Tampere"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Janne Paavilainen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paavilainen:Janne", "Hannu Korhonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korhonen:Hannu", "Kati Alha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alha:Kati", "Jaakko Stenros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stenros:Jaakko", "Elina Koskinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koskinen:Elina", "Frans M\u00e4yr\u00e4.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=auml=yr=auml=:Frans"], "pages": 6}
