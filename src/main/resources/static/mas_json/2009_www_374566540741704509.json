{"title": "Triplify: light-weight linked data publication from relational databases.", "fields": ["semi structured data", "data web", "web modeling", "change data capture", "web mapping"], "abstract": "In this paper we present Triplify - a simplistic but effective approach to publish Linked Data from relational databases. Triplify is based on mapping HTTP-URI requests onto relational database queries. Triplify transforms the resulting relations into RDF statements and publishes the data on the Web in various RDF serializations, in particular as Linked Data. The rationale for developing Triplify is that the largest part of information on the Web is already stored in structured form, often as data contained in relational databases, but usually published by Web applications only as HTML mixing structure, layout and content. In order to reveal the pure structured information behind the current Web, we have implemented Triplify as a light-weight software component, which can be easily integrated into and deployed by the numerous, widely installed Web applications. Our approach includes a method for publishing update logs to enable incremental crawling of linked data sources. Triplify is complemented by a library of configurations for common relational schemata and a REST-enabled data source registry. Triplify configurations containing mappings are provided for many popular Web applications, including osCommerce, WordPress, Drupal, Gallery, and phpBB. We will show that despite its light-weight architecture Triplify is usable to publish very large datasets, such as 160GB of geo data from the OpenStreetMap project.", "citation": "Citations (395)", "departments": ["Leipzig University", "Leipzig University", "Leipzig University", "Leipzig University", "Leipzig University"], "authors": ["S\u00f6ren Auer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Auer:S=ouml=ren", "Sebastian Dietzold.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dietzold:Sebastian", "Jens Lehmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehmann:Jens", "Sebastian Hellmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hellmann:Sebastian", "David Aumueller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aumueller:David"], "conf": "www", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
