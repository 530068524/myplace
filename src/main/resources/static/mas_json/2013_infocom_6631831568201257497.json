{"title": "Can P2P networks be super-scalable?", "fields": ["download", "fluid limit", "stochastic geometry", "phenomenon", "locality"], "abstract": "We propose a new model for peer-to-peer networking which takes the network bottlenecks into account beyond the access. This model can cope with key features of P2P networking like degree or locality constraints together with the fact that distant peers often have a smaller rate than nearby peers. Using a network model based on rate functions, we give a closed form expression of peers download performance in the system's fluid limit, as well as approximations for the other cases. Our results show the existence of realistic settings for which the average download time is a decreasing function of the load, a phenomenon that we call super-scalability.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Baccelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baccelli:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Fabien Mathieu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mathieu:Fabien", "Ilkka Norros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norros:Ilkka", "R\u00e9mi Varloot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varloot:R=eacute=mi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
