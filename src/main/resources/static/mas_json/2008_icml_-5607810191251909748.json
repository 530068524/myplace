Grid clustering partitions the parameter space in the form of a Cartesian product of partitions for each of the parameters. The derived bound provides a means to evaluate clustering solutions in terms of the generalization power of a built-on classifier. For classification based on a single feature the bound serves to find a globally optimal classification rule. Comparison of the generalization power of individual features can then be used for feature ranking. Our experiments show that in this role the bound is much more precise than mutual information or normalized correlation indices.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yevgeny Seldin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seldin:Yevgeny", "Naftali Tishby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tishby:Naftali"], "pages": 8}
