{"title": "Transitively Relational Partial Meet Horn Contraction.", "fields": ["belief revision", "discrete mathematics", "propositional calculus", "transitive relation", "contraction"], "abstract": "Following the recent trend of studying the theory of belief revision under the Horn fragment of propositional logic this paper develops a fully characterised Horn contraction which is analogous to the traditional transitively relational partial meet contraction [Alchourron et al., 1985]. This Horn contraction extends the partial meet Horn contraction studied in [Delgrande and Wassermann, 2010] so that it is guided by a transitive relation that models the ordering of plausibility over sets of beliefs.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhi Qiang Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Zhi_Qiang", "Maurice Pagnucco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pagnucco:Maurice"], "pages": 7}
