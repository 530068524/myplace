{"title": "Reading the Videos: Temporal Labeling for Crowdsourced Time-Sync Videos Based on Semantic Embedding.", "fields": ["semantic data model", "timestamp", "popularity", "sync", "baseline"], "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the boom of online sharing media contents, which raise significant challenges in effective management and retrieval. Though a large amount of efforts have been made, precise retrieval on video shots with certain topics has been largely ignored. At the same time, due to the popularity of novel time-sync comments, or so-called \"bullet-screen comments\", video semantics could be now combined with timestamps to support further research on temporal video labeling. In this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework to assign temporal labels on highlighted video shots. To be specific, due to the informal expression of bullet-screen comments, we first propose a temporal deep structured semantic model (T-DSSM) to represent comments into semantic vectors by taking advantage of their temporal correlation. Then, video highlights are recognized and labeled via semantic vectors in a supervised way. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset prove that our framework could effectively label video highlights with a significant margin compared with baselines, which clearly validates the potential of our framework on video understanding, as well as bullet-screen comments interpretation.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Ant Financial Services Group"], "authors": ["Guangyi Lv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lv:Guangyi", "Tong Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Tong", "Enhong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Enhong", "Qi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0003:Qi", "Yi Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Yi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
