Our approach is based on a high-level hierarchical programming model that results in both a very clean semantics of the application while at the same time creating well-defined interfaces for customization of application components. A prototypical implementation of a conference management system shows the efficacy of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Raphael M.
