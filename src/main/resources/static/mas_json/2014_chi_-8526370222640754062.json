Our device does not require any configuration and is intended for the development of wearable and tangible systems. Our approach allows a bi-directional power flow without any change in the circuit, such that the same circuit can be used for charging and discharging a battery. The contribution of this work is an enabling technology for researchers and practitioners in the fields of Wearable Electronics, Ubiquitous Computing and Human-Computer Interaction interested in exploring new interactions powered by watt-range inductive links. It enables smaller battery sizes, and therefore lighter devices, as the power can be distributed in a way that has not been feasible before. We discuss the motivations, technical details and the workshop evaluating our inductive approach.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Aalto University", "Aalto University", "Aalto University", "iCraft Oy, Tampere, Finland", "iCraft Oy, Tampere, Finland"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jussi Mikkonen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mikkonen:Jussi", "Ramyah Gowrishankar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gowrishankar:Ramyah", "Miia Oksanen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oksanen:Miia", "Harri Raittinen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raittinen:Harri", "Arto Kolinummi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolinummi:Arto"], "pages": 10}
