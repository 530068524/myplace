For $4$-bit messages, the attacks fully recover the target message using $2^{21}$ examples for the FF3 NIST standard and $2^{25}$ examples for the FF1 NIST standard. The examples include only three messages per tweak, which is what makes the attacks non-trivial even though the total number of examples exceeds the size of the domain. The attacks are rigorously analyzed in a new definitional framework of message-recovery security. The attacks are easily put out of reach by increasing the number of Feistel rounds in the standards.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Florida State University", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Viet Tung Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Viet_Tung", "Stefano Tessaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tessaro:Stefano"], "pages": 12}
