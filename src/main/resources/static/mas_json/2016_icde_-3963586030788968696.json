The task boils down to measuring the proximity between two nodes on a graph. Although most earlier studies deal with homogeneous or bipartite graphs only, many real-world graphs are heterogeneous with objects of various types, giving rise to different semantic classes of proximity. For instance, on a social network two users can be close for different reasons, such as being classmates or family members, which represent two distinct classes of proximity. Thus, it becomes inadequate to only measure a \u201cgeneric\u201d form of proximity as previous works have focused on. In this paper, we identify metagraphs as a novel and effective means to characterize the common structures for a desired class of proximity. Subsequently, we propose a family of metagraph-based proximity, and employ a supervised technique to automatically learn the right form of proximity within its family to suit the desired class. As it is expensive to match (i.e., find the instances of) a metagraph, we propose the novel approaches of dual-stage training and symmetry-based matching to speed up. Finally, our experiments reveal that our approach is significantly more accurate and efficient. For accuracy, we outperform the baselines by 11% and 16% in NDCG and MAP, respectively. For efficiency, dual-stage training reduces the overall matching cost by 83%, and symmetry-based matching further decreases the cost of individual metagraphs by 52%.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Institute for I ... arch, Singapore", "Institute for I ... arch, Singapore", "Institute for I ... arch, Singapore"], "authors": ["Yuan Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Yuan", "Wenqing Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Wenqing", "Vincent Wenchen Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Vincent_Wenchen", "Min Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0008:Min", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kevin_Chen=Chuan", "Xiaoli Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiaoli"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
