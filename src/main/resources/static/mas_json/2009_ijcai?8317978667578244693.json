RETRASE uses classical planning to create basis functions for value-function approximation and applies expected-utility analysis to this compact space. Our algorithm is memory-efficient and fast (due to its compact, approximate representation), returns high-quality solutions (due to the decision-theoretic framework) and does not require additional knowledge from domain engineers (since we apply classical planning to automatically construct the basis functions). Experiments demonstrate that RETRASE outperforms winners from the past three probabilistic-planning competitions on many hard problems.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Andrey Kolobov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolobov:Andrey", "Mausam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mausam:", "Daniel S.
