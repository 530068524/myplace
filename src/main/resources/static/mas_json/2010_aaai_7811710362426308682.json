However, agent programming systems that are accessible to behavioral scientists are too limited to create rich agents, and systems for creating rich agents are accessible mainly to computer scientists, not behavioral scientists.  We are solving this problem by engaging behavioral scientists in the design of a programming language, and integrating reinforcement learning into the programming language.  This strategy will help our language achieve adaptivity, modularity, and, most importantly, accessibility to behavioral scientists.  In addition to allowing behavioral scientist to write rich agent programs, our language \u2014 AFABL (A Friendly Behavior Language) \u2014 will enable a true discipline of modular agent software engineering with broad implications for games, interactive storytelling, and social simulations.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Christopher L.
