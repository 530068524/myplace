Recent work on formula compilation by prime implicate/implicant generation often assumes a Conjunctive/Disjunctive Normal Form (CNF/DNF) representation. However, in many settings propositional formulae are naturally expressed in non-clausal form. Despite a large body of work on compilation of non-clausal formulae, in practice existing approaches can only be applied to fairly small formulae, containing at most a few hundred variables. This paper describes two novel approaches for the compilation of non-clausal formulae either with prime implicants or implicates, that is based on propositional Satisfiability (SAT) solving. These novel algorithms also find application when computing all prime implicates of a CNF formula. The proposed approach is shown to allow the compilation of non-clausal formulae of size significantly larger than existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["INESC-ID", "INESC-ID", "INESC-ID", "UCD, CASL, Dublin, Ireland"], "authors": ["Alessandro Previti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Previti:Alessandro", "Alexey Ignatiev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ignatiev:Alexey", "Ant\u00f3nio Morgado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morgado:Ant=oacute=nio", "Jo\u00e3o Marques-Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marques=Silva:Jo=atilde=o"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
