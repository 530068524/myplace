{"title": "As Light as your Footsteps: Altering Walking Sounds to Change Perceived Body Weight, Emotional State and Gait.", "fields": ["sonification", "gait", "sedentary lifestyle", "heel", "swing"], "abstract": "An ever more sedentary lifestyle is a serious problem in our society. Enhancing people's exercise adherence through technology remains an important research challenge. We propose a novel approach for a system supporting walking that draws from basic findings in neuroscience research. Our shoe-based prototype senses a person's footsteps and alters in real-time the frequency spectra of the sound they produce while walking. The resulting sounds are consistent with those produced by either a lighter or heavier body. Our user study showed that modified walking sounds change one's own perceived body weight and lead to a related gait pattern. In particular, augmenting the high frequencies of the sound leads to the perception of having a thinner body and enhances the motivation for physical activity inducing a more dynamic swing and a shorter heel strike. We here discuss the opportunities and the questions our findings open.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University of London", "University of London", "University College London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ana Tajadura-Jim\u00e9nez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tajadura=Jim=eacute=nez:Ana", "Maria Basia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basia:Maria", "Ophelia Deroy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deroy:Ophelia", "Merle Fairhurst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fairhurst:Merle", "Nicolai Marquardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marquardt:Nicolai", "Nadia Bianchi-Berthouze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bianchi=Berthouze:Nadia"], "pages": 10}
