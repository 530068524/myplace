I.e. by approximating the similarity between x and x\u2032 as the hamming distance between f (x) and g(x\u2032), for two distinct binary codes f, g, rather than as the hamming distance between f (x) and f (x\u2032).", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "University of Toronto", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "authors": ["Behnam Neyshabur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neyshabur:Behnam", "Nati Srebro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebro:Nati", "Ruslan Salakhutdinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salakhutdinov:Ruslan", "Yury Makarychev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Makarychev:Yury", "Payman Yadollahpour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yadollahpour:Payman"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
