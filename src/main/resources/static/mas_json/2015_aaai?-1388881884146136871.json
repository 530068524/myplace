{"title": "Shift-Pessimistic Active Learning Using Robust Bias-Aware Prediction.", "fields": ["binary classification", "certainty", "semi supervised learning", "generalization error", "multi task learning"], "abstract": "Existing approaches to active learning are generally optimistic about their certainty with respect to data shift between labeled and unlabeled data. They assume that unknown datapoint labels follow the inductive biases of the active learner. As a result, the most useful data-point labels\u2014ones that refute current inductive biases\u2014 are rarely solicited. We propose a shift-pessimistic approach to active learning that assumes the worst-case about the unknown conditional label distribution. This closely aligns model uncertainty with generalization error, enabling more useful label solicitation. We investigate the theoretical benefits of this approach and demonstrate its empirical advantages on probabilistic binary classification tasks.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Anqi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Anqi", "Lev Reyzin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reyzin:Lev", "Brian D.
