Different from existing hand-crafted face descriptors such as local binary pattern (LBP) and Gabor features which require strong prior knowledge, our SLBFLE is an unsupervised feature learning approach which is automatically learned from raw pixels. Unlike existing binary face descriptors such as the LBP and discriminant face descriptor (DFD) which use a two-stage feature extraction approach, our SLBFLE jointly learns binary codes for local face patches and the codebook for feature encoding so that discriminative information from raw pixels can be simultaneously learned with a one-stage procedure. Experimental results on four widely used face datasets including LFW, YouTube Face (YTF), FERET and PaSC clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Jiwen Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Jiwen", "Venice Erin Liong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liong:Venice_Erin", "Jie Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Jie"], "pages": 9}
