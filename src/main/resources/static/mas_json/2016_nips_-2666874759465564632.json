Our approach is based on a recently proposed framework for optimal structure learning based on non-decomposable scores, which is general enough to accommodate ancestral constraints. The proposed framework exploits oracles for learning structures using decomposable scores, which cannot accommodate ancestral constraints since they are non-decomposable. We show how to empower these oracles by passing them decomposable constraints that they can handle, which are inferred from ancestral constraints that they cannot handle. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach can be orders-of-magnitude more efficient than alternative frameworks, such as those based on integer linear programming.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Eunice Yuh-Jie Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Eunice_Yuh=Jie", "Yujia Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Yujia", "Arthur Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Arthur", "Adnan Darwiche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darwiche:Adnan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
