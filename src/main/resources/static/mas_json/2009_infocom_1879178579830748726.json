{"title": "C-MAC: Model-Driven Concurrent Medium Access Control for Wireless Sensor Networks.", "fields": ["power control", "access control", "throughput", "channel", "signal to interference plus noise ratio"], "abstract": "This paper presents C-MAC, a new MAC protocol designed to achieve high-throughput bulk communication for data-intensive sensing applications. C-MAC exploits concurrent wireless channel access based on empirical power control and physical interference models. Nodes running C-MAC estimate the level of interference based on the physical signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) model and adjust the transmission power accordingly for concurrent channel access. C-MAC employs a block-based communication mode that not only amortizes the overhead of channel assessment, but also improves the probability that multiple nodes within the interference range of each other can transmit concurrently. C-MAC has been implemented in TinyOS-1.x and extensively evaluated on Tmote nodes. Our experiments show that C-MAC significantly outperforms the state-of-art CSMA protocol in TinyOS with respect to system throughput, delay and energy consumption.", "citation": "Citations (119)", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "College of William & Mary", "City University of Hong Kong", "University of Tennessee", "Computer Scienc ... and Engineering"], "authors": ["Mo Sha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sha_0001:Mo", "Guoliang Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Guoliang", "Gang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Gang", "Shucheng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Shucheng", "Xiaorui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaorui"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
