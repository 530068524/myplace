Following the intuition that an object part based representation and a suitable part selection process may help achieve our purpose, we formulate the part selection problem from a statistical manifold modeling perspective and treat part selection as adjusting the manifold of the object (parameterized by pose) by means of the manifold \u201calignment\u201d and \u201cexpansion\u201d operations. We show that manifold alignment and expansion are equivalent to minimizing the intra-class distance given a pose while increasing the inter-pose distance given an object instance respectively. We formulate and solve this (otherwise intractable) part selection problem as a combinatorial optimization problem using graph analysis techniques. Quantitative and qualitative experimental analysis validates our theoretical claims.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Liang Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Liang", "Jingen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jingen", "Alfred O.
