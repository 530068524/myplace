{"title": "Towards interactive mindfulness training using breathing based feedback.", "fields": ["interactivity", "meditation", "breathing", "feedback loop", "mindfulness"], "abstract": "Although regular meditation practice is linked to numerous mental health and cognitive benefits, it is often difficult for beginners to maintain focus during practice and persevere with the activity over time. To tackle this issue, we externalised the ability of self reporting loss of focus by developing a feedback loop that helps the user track and maintain their concentration levels in a non-invasive manner. We hypothesise that the change in breathing pattern can indicate a loss of concentration and the act of audibly amplifying a person's breathing sounds during meditation can help them regain and maintain focus on their breathing, leading to a more effective meditation session. We present experimental designs and findings towards this end.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Royal College of Art", "Keio University", "Royal College of Art", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Andrea M.
