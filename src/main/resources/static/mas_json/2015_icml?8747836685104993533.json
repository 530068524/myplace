{"title": "An Empirical Exploration of Recurrent Network Architectures.", "fields": ["machine learning", "network architecture", "pattern recognition", "recurrent neural network", "architecture"], "abstract": "The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is an extremely powerful sequence model that is often difficult to train. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a specific RNN architecture whose design makes it much easier to train. While wildly successful in practice, the LSTM's architecture appears to be ad-hoc so it is not clear if it is optimal, and the significance of its individual components is unclear.\n\nIn this work, we aim to determine whether the LSTM architecture is optimal or whether much better architectures exist. We conducted a thorough architecture search where we evaluated over ten thousand different RNN architectures, and identified an architecture that outperforms both the LSTM and the recently-introduced Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) on some but not all tasks. We found that adding a bias of 1 to the LSTM's forget gate closes the gap between the LSTM and the GRU.", "citation": "Citations (552)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Google", "New York University", "Facebook", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Rafal J\u00f3zefowicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=oacute=zefowicz:Rafal", "Wojciech Zaremba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaremba:Wojciech", "Ilya Sutskever.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sutskever:Ilya"], "pages": 9}
