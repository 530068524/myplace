In this study we explore how people use social network information, which is increasingly accessible on enterprise systems in organizations, to choose people with whom to collaborate. We conducted a scenario-based study of 459 respondents in a global high-tech company. Our data indicate cultural differences in how social network information was valued when choosing a collaborator. The Chinese, consistent with the cultural value of Guanxi, more closely followed a  closure  model, whereas Americans favored neither a  closure  nor a  structural holes  model. These results provide new insights into how needs for social network information may vary between cultures and how social networking sites might support workers in choosing collaborators from within and across national cultures.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Stanford University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Ge Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Ge", "Pamela J.
