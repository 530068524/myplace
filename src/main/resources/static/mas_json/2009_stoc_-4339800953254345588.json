While this problem is known to admit good approximation algorithms in the offline case, no algorithms were known for this problem in the online setting.   In this paper, we give a randomized O(r max  log 3  n) competitive online algorithm for this edge-connectivity network design problem, where r max  = max ij  r ij . Our algorithms use the standard embeddings of graphs into random subtrees (i.e., into singly connected subgraphs) as an intermediate step to get algorithms for higher connectivity.   Our results for the online problem give us approximation algorithms that admit strict cost-shares with the same strictness value. This, in turn, implies approximation algorithms for (a) the rent-or-buy version and (b) the (two-stage) stochastic version of the edge-connected network design problem with independent arrivals. For these two problems, if we are in the case when the underlying graph is complete and the edge-costs are metric (i.e., satisfy the triangle inequality), we improve our results to give O(1)-strict cost shares, which gives constant-factor rent-or-buy and stochastic algorithms for these instances.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Anupam Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Anupam", "Ravishankar Krishnaswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnaswamy:Ravishankar", "R.
