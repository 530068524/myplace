In order to automatically generate a novel and non-redundant community answer summary, we segment the complex original multi-sentence question into several sub questions and then propose a general Conditional Random Field (CRF) based answer summary method with group L1 regularization. Various textual and non-textual QA features are explored. Specifically, we explore four different types of contextual factors, namely, the information novelty and non-redundancy modeling for local and non-local sentence interactions under question segmentation. To further unleash the potential of the abundant cQA features, we introduce the group L1 regularization for feature learning. Experimental results on a Yahoo! Answers dataset show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cQA summarization task.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Wen Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Wen", "Xiangdong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiangdong", "Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0009:Wei", "Tat-Seng Chua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chua:Tat=Seng"], "pages": 10}
