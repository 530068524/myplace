{"title": "A user-guided approach to program analysis.", "fields": ["soundness", "program analysis", "theoretical computer science", "java", "solver"], "abstract": "Program analysis tools often produce undesirable output due to various approximations. We present an approach and a system EUGENE that allows user feedback to guide such approximations towards producing the desired output. We formulate the problem of user-guided program analysis in terms of solving a combination of hard rules and soft rules: hard rules capture soundness while soft rules capture degrees of approximations and preferences of users. Our technique solves the rules using an off-the-shelf solver in a manner that is sound (satisfies all hard rules), optimal (maximally satisfies soft rules), and scales to real-world analyses and programs. We evaluate EUGENE on two different analyses with labeled output on a suite of seven Java programs of size 131\u2013198 KLOC. We also report upon a user study involving nine users who employ EUGENE to guide an information-flow analysis on three Java micro-benchmarks. In our experiments, EUGENE significantly reduces misclassified reports upon providing limited amounts of feedback.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ravi Mangal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mangal:Ravi", "Xin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xin", "Aditya V.
