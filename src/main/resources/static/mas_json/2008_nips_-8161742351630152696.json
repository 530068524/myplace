These findings are inconsistent with standard models of motion integration which predict best performance for translation [6]. To explain this discrepancy, our theory formulates motion perception at two levels of inference: we first perform model selection between the competing models (e.g. translation, rotation, and expansion) and then estimate the velocity using the selected model. We define novel prior models for smooth rotation and expansion using techniques similar to those in the slow-and-smooth model [17] (e.g. Green functions of differential operators). The theory gives good agreement with the trends observed in human experiments.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shuang Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Shuang", "Hongjing Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Hongjing", "Alan L.
