With age can come difficulties or disabilities to carry out daily life tasks, alone. Studies show that the number of the elderly people in France will be multiplied by two, within the next thirty years. To postpone as long as possible the hospitalization of dependent persons and allow them to live with dignity, researchers have been working on home automation, smart-homes and ambient assisted living. Nowadays, houses are still evolving and have, within them, equipments always more smarter. It is not uncommon to see electronic devices such as computer, connected tv and smart sensors: as many powerful resources not completely used. However, those untapped capacities could be used for person monitoring, video processing and other greedy algorithms, without adding any new specialized component. Thus it could ensure the quality of services required by the user and the dependability of its home automation system.   This paper presents a method of service deployment in an environment for handicap persons, based on ontologies and supervision.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de B ...
