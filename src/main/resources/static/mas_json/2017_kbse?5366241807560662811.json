In JavaScript applications, events may be generated, triggered and consumed non-deterministically. Thus, JavaScript applications may suffer from non-deterministic bugs, when events are triggered and consumed in an unexpected order. In this proposal, we aim to characterize and combat non-deterministic bugs in JavaScript applications. Specifically, we first perform a comprehensive study about real-world non-deterministic bugs in server-side JavaScript applications. In order to facilitate bug diagnosis, we further propose approaches to isolate the necessary events that are responsible for the occurrence of a failure. We also plan to design new techniques in detecting non-deterministic bugs in JavaScript applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "authors": ["Jie Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jie"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
