{"title": "Fast Graph Pattern Matching.", "fields": ["block graph", "distance hereditary graph", "complement graph", "null graph", "factor critical graph"], "abstract": "Due to rapid growth of the Internet technology and new scientific/technological advances, the number of applications that model data as graphs increases, because graphs have high expressive power to model complicated structures. The dominance of graphs in real-world applications asks for new graph data management so that users can access graph data effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we study a graph pattern matching problem over a large data graph. The problem is to find all patterns in a large data graph that match a user-given graph pattern. We propose a new two-step R-join (reachability join) algorithm with filter step and fetch step based on a cluster- based join-index with graph codes. We consider the filter step as an R-semijoin, and propose a new optimization approach by interleaving R-joins with R-semijoins. We conducted extensive performance studies, and confirm the efficiency of our proposed new approaches.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "IBM"], "authors": ["Jiefeng Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Jiefeng", "Jeffrey Xu Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Jeffrey_Xu", "Bolin Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Bolin", "Philip S.
