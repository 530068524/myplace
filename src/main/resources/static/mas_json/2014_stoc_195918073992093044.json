{"title": "From hierarchical partitions to hierarchical covers: optimal fault-tolerant spanners for doubling metrics.", "fields": ["spanner", "long line", "binary logarithm", "complete graph", "vertex"], "abstract": "A (1+ e )- spanner  for a doubling metric ( X, \u0394 ) is a subgraph  H  of the complete graph corresponding to ( X, \u0394 ), which preserves all pairwise distances to within a factor of 1 +  e . A natural requirement from a spanner, which is essential for many applications (mainly in distributed systems or wireless networks), is to be robust against vertex and edge failures -- so that even when some vertices and edges in the network fail, we still have a (1 +  e )-spanner for what remains. The spanner  H  is called a  k-fault-tolerant  (1 +  e )- spanner , for 1 \u2264  k  \u2264  n  -- 2, if for any  F  \u2286  X  with | F | \u2264  k , the graph  H  --  F  (obtained by removing from  H  the vertices of  F  and their incident edges) is a (1 +  e )-spanner for  X  --  F .   In this paper we devise an optimal construction of fault-tolerant spanners for doubling metrics: For any  n -point doubling metric, any  e  > 0, and any integer 1 \u2264  k  \u2264  n  -- 2, our construction provides a  k -fault-tolerant (1+ e )-spanner with optimal degree  O ( k ) within optimal time  O ( n  log  n + kn ).   We then strengthen this result to provide near-optimal (up to a factor of log  k ) guarantees on the diameter and weight of our spanners, namely, diameter  O (log  n ) and weight  O ( k  2  +  k  log  n ) \u00b7  \u03c9 ( MST ), while preserving the optimal guarantees on the degree  O ( k ) and the runtime  O ( n  log  n + kn ).   Our result settles several fundamental open questions in this area, culminating a long line of research that started with the STOC'95 paper of Arya et al. and the STOC'98 paper of Levcopoulos et al.   On the way to this result we develop a new technique for constructing spanners in doubling metrics. In particular, our spanner construction is based on a novel  hierarchical cover  of the metric, whereas most previous constructions of spanners for doubling and Euclidean metrics (such as the net-tree spanner) are based on  hierarchical partitions  of the metric. We demonstrate the power of hierarchical covers in the context of geometric spanners by improving the state-of-the-art results in this area.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shay Solomon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solomon:Shay"], "pages": 10}
