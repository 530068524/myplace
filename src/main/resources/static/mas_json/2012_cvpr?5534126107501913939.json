Although various approaches are proposed to incorporate spatial constraints into the BoW model, most of them are either too strict or too loose so that they are only effective in limited cases. We propose a new spatially-constrained similarity measure (SCSM) to handle object rotation, scaling, view point change and appearance deformation. The similarity measure can be efficiently calculated by a voting-based method using inverted files. Object retrieval and localization are then simultaneously achieved without post-processing. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and robust re-ranking method with the k-nearest neighbors of the query for automatically refining the initial search results. Extensive performance evaluations on six public datasets show that SCSM significantly outperforms other spatial models, while k-NN re-ranking outperforms most state-of-the-art approaches using query expansion.", "citation": "Citations (177)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Tel Aviv University", "Northwestern University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xiaohui Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xiaohui", "Zhe Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin_0001:Zhe", "Jonathan Brandt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brandt:Jonathan", "Shai Avidan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avidan:Shai", "Ying Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ying"], "pages": 8}
