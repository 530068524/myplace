HOPE is built on top of a novel tuple-group based database partitioning model, which is able to minimize the number of distributed transactions as well as the extent of partition and workload skews during the workload execution. HOPE conducts the partitioning in an iterative manner in order to achieve better partitioning quality, save the user's time spent on partitioning design and increase its application scenes. HOPE is also highly interactive, as it provides rich opportunities for the user to help it further improve the partitioning quality by passing expertise and indirect domain knowledge.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["EMC Labs, USA", "EMC Labs, USA", "EMC Labs, USA", "EMC Labs, USA"], "authors": ["Yu Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yu", "Xiaoyan Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Xiaoyan", "Baoyao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Baoyao", "Stephen Todd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Todd:Stephen"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
