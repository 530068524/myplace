Exercise video games reach a wide audience and can be used to motivate increased physical activity. We have previously developed Astrojumper, an exergame exploring game mechanics that provide a fun experience and effective exercise, and have now developed a new version of Astrojumper that supports interval training through additional mechanics. We believe the new version will improve upon the first in player motivation, enjoyment and replayability, and also in the level of physical challenge the game affords its players.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "authors": ["Andrea Nickel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nickel:Andrea", "Hugh Kinsey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kinsey:Hugh", "Heidi Haack.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haack:Heidi", "Mykel Pendergrass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pendergrass:Mykel", "Tiffany Barnes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barnes:Tiffany"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
