This form factor impacts how users (1) notice the public display (2) develop motivation and (3) (socially) interact with the public display. In this paper, we present  Chained Displays , a combination of several screens to create different form factors for interactive public displays. We also present a design space based on two complementary concepts,  Focus  and  Nimbus , to describe and compare chained display configurations. Finally, we performed a field study comparing three chained displays:  Flat, Concave , and  Hexagonal . Results show that  Flat  triggers the strongest honeypot effect,  Hexagonal  causes low social learning, and  Concave  triggers the smallest amount of simultaneously interacting users among other findings.", "citation": "Citations (99)", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin"], "authors": ["Maurice Ten Koppel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koppel:Maurice_Ten", "Gilles Bailly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bailly:Gilles", "J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:J=ouml=rg", "Robert Walter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walter:Robert"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
