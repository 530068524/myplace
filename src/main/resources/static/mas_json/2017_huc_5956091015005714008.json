GTFS data is a common format for the public transportation schedules with associated geographic information The tool consists of two main parts: preprocessor and visualizer. The preprocessor retrieves and transfers the GTFS data into a new data format for the visualizer. The visualizer displays an animation of public transport movement according to its schedule specified in the GTFS data on a map. It also displays a graph of the number of public transport vehicles per hour, and allows the user to choose a specific transport route, trip, and stations to visualize. This is the first attempt to build a tool that preprocesses and visualizes GTFS data that is publically available in a format that is not so easy to process with existing standard data visualization tools.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chiang Mai University", "Chiang Mai University", "Chiang Mai University", "University of Calgary"], "authors": ["Narumon Kunama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kunama:Narumon", "Mudtana Worapan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Worapan:Mudtana", "Santi Phithakkitnukoon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phithakkitnukoon:Santi", "Merkebe Getachew Demissie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demissie:Merkebe_Getachew"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
