As every network is frequently exposed to many different threats causing network disruptions, network recovery is the prime capability needed to achieve this objective. After a brief introduction on the existing reactive recovery methods we present a new method of proactive detection and explain how the method can be applied to some recovery schemes and discuss its benefits.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Orange S.A.", "Orange S.A.", "Orange S.A.", "\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Bretagne", "\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Bretagne"], "authors": ["Jelena Pesic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pesic:Jelena", "Julien Meuric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meuric:Julien", "Esther Le Rouzic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rouzic:Esther_Le", "Laurent Dupont.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dupont:Laurent", "Michel Morvan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morvan:Michel"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
