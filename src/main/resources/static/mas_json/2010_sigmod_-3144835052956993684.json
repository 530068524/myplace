{"title": "Exploratory keyword search on data graphs.", "fields": ["ranking", "information retrieval", "question answering", "graph", "schema"], "abstract": "A system for keyword search on data graphs is demonstrated on two challenging datasets: the large DBLP and Mondial (which is highly cyclic and has a complex schema). The system supports search, exploration and question answering. The demonstration shows how the system copes with the main challenges in keywords search on data graphs. In particular, the system generates answers efficiently and completely (i.e., it does not miss answers). It has an effective ranking mechanism that also takes into account redundancies among answers. Finally, the system uses a novel technique for displaying multi-node subtrees in a compact graphical form that facilitates quick and easy understanding, which is essential for effective browsing of the answers.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "IBM", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Hilit Achiezra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achiezra:Hilit", "Konstantin Golenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golenberg:Konstantin", "Benny Kimelfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimelfeld:Benny", "Yehoshua Sagiv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sagiv:Yehoshua"], "pages": 4}
