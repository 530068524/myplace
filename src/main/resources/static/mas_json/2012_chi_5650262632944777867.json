In so doing, we illustrate the various levels at which agency can emerge in the context of intensive short-time prototyping sessions. In HCI, it is often assumed that the designer is the agent that acts intentionally in the design process. Contrary to this, recent notions of agency provide a way of analysing the performative role of design materials as intra-actions between components within a given phenomenon, rather than as meanings merely ascribed by actions of designers. The notion of agency puts focus on the emerging properties of materials and how they actively contribute to the way that design activity unfolds. The analyses showed how interaction design is to a large extent driven by emergent characteristics of available materials. The results have implications for understanding material interactions and materiality in interaction design.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "departments": ["Stockholm University", "Stockholm University", "Mobile Life Cen ... ockholm, Sweden"], "authors": ["Jakob Tholander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tholander:Jakob", "Maria Normark.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Normark:Maria", "Chiara Rossitto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossitto:Chiara"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
