Despite its often devastating impact on families, scant research has focused on how to facilitate the well-being of family caregivers. The aim of this paper is to uncover the challenges faced by family caregivers and support their well-being with the use of technologies. To understand the emotional and social burden of caregivers and how they handle their stress, we conducted in-depth interviews with 15 individuals who have cared for a depressed family member. Our findings reveal the multifaceted dilemma of caring for a depressed family member as well as the various strategies engaged in by caregivers to improve their own situations. Based on our findings, we suggest design implications for healthcare technologies to improve the wellness of caregivers who are looking after depressed family members.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Tsukuba", "Future University Hakodate", "Osaka University", "NTT Communicati ... n, Kyoto, Japan"], "authors": ["Naomi Yamashita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamashita:Naomi", "Hideaki Kuzuoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuzuoka:Hideaki", "Keiji Hirata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirata:Keiji", "Takashi Kudo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kudo:Takashi"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
