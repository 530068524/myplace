However, the performance of these methods degrades rapidly as the number of random accesses increases. In this paper, we propose a novel and general sequential access scheme for top- k  query evaluation, which outperforms existing methods. We extend this scheme to efficiently answer top- k  queries in subspace and on dynamic data. We also study the \"dual\" form of top- k  queries called \"ranking\" queries, which returns the rank of a specified record/object, and propose an exact as well as two approximate solutions. An extensive empirical evaluation validates the robustness and efficiency of our techniques.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Independent Con ... ncouver, Canada"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Wen Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Wen", "Jignesh M.
