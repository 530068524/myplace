{"title": "Robust Monocular Epipolar Flow Estimation.", "fields": ["optical flow", "epipolar geometry", "flow", "estimation theory", "monocular"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of computing optical flow in monocular video taken from a moving vehicle. In this setting, the vast majority of image flow is due to the vehicle's ego-motion. We propose to take advantage of this fact and estimate flow along the epipolar lines of the egomotion. Towards this goal, we derive a slanted-plane MRF model which explicitly reasons about the ordering of planes and their physical validity at junctions. Furthermore, we present a bottom-up grouping algorithm which produces over-segmentations that respect flow boundaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the challenging KITTI flow benchmark [11] achieving half the error of the best competing general flow algorithm and one third of the error of the best epipolar flow algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (106)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["TTI Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA", "TTI Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA", "TTI Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Koichiro Yamaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamaguchi:Koichiro", "David A.
