Privacy-preserving authentication in RFID systems is a very important problem. Existing protocols employ tree structures to achieve fast authentication. We observe that these protocols require a tag to transmit a large amount of data in each authentication, which costs significant bandwidth and energy overhead. Current protocols also impose heavy computational demand on the RFID reader. To address these issues, we design two privacy-preserving protocols based on a new technique called cryptographical encoding, which significantly reduces both authentication data transmitted by each tag and computation overhead incurred at the reader. Our analysis shows that the new protocols are able to reduce authentication data by more than an order of magnitude and reduce computational demand by about an order of magnitude, when comparing with the best existing protocol.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0013:Tao", "Wen Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Wen", "Zhen Mo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mo:Zhen", "Shigang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shigang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
