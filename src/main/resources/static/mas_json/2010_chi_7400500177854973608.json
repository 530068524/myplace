With the success of games like Left4Dead, many game designers and producers are currently exploring the addition of cooperative patterns within their games. Unfortunately, very little research investigated cooperative patterns or methods to evaluate them. In this paper, we present a set of cooperative patterns identified based on analysis of fourteen cooperative games. Additionally, we propose Cooperative Performance Metrics (CPM). To evaluate the use of these CPMs, we ran a study with a total of 60 participants, grouped in 2-3 participants per session. Participants were asked to play four cooperative games (Rock Band 2, Lego Star Wars, Kameo, and Little Big Planet). Videos of the play sessions were annotated using the CPMs, which were then mapped to cooperative patterns that caused them. Results, validated through inter-rater agreement, identify several effective cooperative patterns and lessons for future cooperative game designs.", "citation": "Citations (118)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Magy Seif El-Nasr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/El=Nasr:Magy_Seif", "Bardia Aghabeigi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aghabeigi:Bardia", "David Milam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milam:David", "Mona Erfani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Erfani:Mona", "Beth Lameman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lameman:Beth", "Hamid Maygoli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maygoli:Hamid", "Sang Mah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mah:Sang"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
