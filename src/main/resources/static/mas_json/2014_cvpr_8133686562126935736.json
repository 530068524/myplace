{"title": "Diffuse Mirrors: 3D Reconstruction from Diffuse Indirect Illumination Using Inexpensive Time-of-Flight Sensors.", "fields": ["time of flight", "global illumination", "albedo", "3d reconstruction", "reflection"], "abstract": "The functional difference between a diffuse wall and a mirror is well understood: one scatters back into all directions, and the other one preserves the directionality of reflected light. The temporal structure of the light, however, is left intact by both: assuming simple surface reflection, photons that arrive first are reflected first. In this paper, we exploit this insight to recover objects outside the line of sight from second-order diffuse reflections, effectively turning walls into mirrors. We formulate the reconstruction task as a linear inverse problem on the transient response of a scene, which we acquire using an affordable setup consisting of a modulated light source and a time-of-flight image sensor. By exploiting sparsity in the reconstruction domain, we achieve resolutions in the order of a few centimeters for object shape (depth and laterally) and albedo. Our method is robust to ambient light and works for large room-sized scenes. It is drastically faster and less expensive than previous approaches using femtosecond lasers and streak cameras, and does not require any moving parts.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "University of Bonn"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Felix Heide.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heide:Felix", "Lei Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Lei", "Wolfgang Heidrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heidrich:Wolfgang", "Matthias B.
