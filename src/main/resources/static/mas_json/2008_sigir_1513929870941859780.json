Although in principle any standard relevance feedback technique can be applied to negative relevance feedback, it may not perform well due to the lack of positive examples. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of methods for negative relevance feedback. We compare a set of representative negative feedback methods, covering vector-space models and language models, as well as several special heuristics for negative feedback. Evaluating negative feedback methods requires a test set with sufficient difficult topics, but there are not many naturally difficult topics in the existing test collections. We use two sampling strategies to adapt a test collection with easy topics to evaluate negative feedback. Experiment results on several TREC collections show that language model based negative feedback methods are generally more effective than those based on vector-space models, and using multiple negative models is an effective heuristic for negative feedback. Our results also show that it is feasible to adapt test collections with easy topics for evaluating negative feedback methods through sampling.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "OSU, Columbus, OH, USA"], "authors": ["Xuanhui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xuanhui", "Hui Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang_0001:Hui", "ChengXiang Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:ChengXiang"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
