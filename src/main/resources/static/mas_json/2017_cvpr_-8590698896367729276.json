{"title": "Superpixels and Polygons Using Simple Non-iterative Clustering.", "fields": ["image segmentation", "machine learning", "cluster analysis", "polygon", "memory management"], "abstract": "We present an improved version of the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) superpixel segmentation. Unlike SLIC, our algorithm is non-iterative, enforces connectivity from the start, requires lesser memory, and is faster. Relying on the superpixel boundaries obtained using our algorithm, we also present a polygonal partitioning algorithm. We demonstrate that our superpixels as well as the polygonal partitioning are superior to the respective state-of-the-art algorithms on quantitative benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Radhakrishna Achanta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achanta:Radhakrishna", "Sabine S\u00fcsstrunk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=uuml=sstrunk:Sabine"], "pages": 10}
