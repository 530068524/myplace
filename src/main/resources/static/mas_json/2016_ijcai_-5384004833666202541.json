{"title": "Achieving Proportional Representation in Conference Programs.", "fields": ["approximation algorithm", "proportional representation", "optimization problem", "randomized rounding", "graph"], "abstract": "We study the optimization problem of designing theprogram of a conference with parallel sessions, so that the intended participants are as happy as possible from the talks they can attend. Interestingly,this can be thought of as a two-dimensional ex-tension of a scheme proposed by Chamberlin and Courant [1983] for achieving proportional representation in multi-winner elections. We show that different variations of the problem are computa-ionally hard by exploiting relations of the problem with well-known hard graph problems. On the positive side, we present polynomial-time algorithms that compute conference programs that have a social utility that is provably close to the optimal one (within constant factors). Our algorithms are either combinatorial or based on linear programming and randomized rounding.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Patras", "Paris Dauphine University", "Paris Dauphine University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Ioannis Caragiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Caragiannis:Ioannis", "Laurent Gourv\u00e8s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gourv=egrave=s:Laurent", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Monnot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monnot:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me"], "pages": 7}
