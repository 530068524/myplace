Ideally, such cross-platform management would yield high performance at low cost, but in practice, the performance consequences of such decisions are often hard to predict. In this paper, we present an approach to guide cross-platform management for real-world Internet services. Our approach is driven by a novel performance model that predicts application-level performance across changes in platform parameters, such as processor cache sizes, processor speeds, etc., and can be calibrated with data commonly available in today's production environments. Our model is structured as a composition of several empirically observed, parsimonious sub-models. These sub-models have few free parameters and can be calibrated with lightweight passive observations on a current production platform. We demonstrate the usefulness of our cross-platform model in two management problems. First, our model provides accurate performance predictions when selecting the next generation of processors to enter a server farm. Second, our model can guide platform-aware load balancing across heterogeneous server farms.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard", "University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Christopher Stewart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stewart:Christopher", "Terence Kelly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelly:Terence", "Alex Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Alex", "Kai Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Kai"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2008", "pages": 14}
