The advantage is that we only require a prior distribution on a class of simulators. This is useful when a probabilistic model of the underlying process is too complex to formulate, but where detailed simulation models are available. ABC-RL allows the use of any Bayesian reinforcement learning technique in this case. It can be seen as an extension of simulation methods to both planning and inference. We experimentally demonstrate the potential of this approach in a comparison with LSPI. Finally, we introduce a theorem showing that ABC is sound.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Ioannina"], "authors": ["Christos Dimitrakakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dimitrakakis:Christos", "Nikolaos Tziortziotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tziortziotis:Nikolaos"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
