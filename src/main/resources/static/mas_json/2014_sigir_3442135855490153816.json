We observe a Markov chain in session search: user's judgment of retrieved documents in the previous search iteration affects user's actions in the next iteration. We thus propose to model session search as a dual-agent stochastic game: the user agent and the search engine agent work together to jointly maximize their long term rewards. The framework, which we term \"win-win search\", is based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We mathematically model dynamics in session search, including decision states, query changes, clicks, and rewards, as a cooperative game between the user and the search engine. The experiments on TREC 2012 and 2013 Session datasets show a statistically significant improvement over the state-of-the-art interactive search and session search algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["Georgetown University", "Georgetown University", "Georgetown University"], "authors": ["Jiyun Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Jiyun", "Sicong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Sicong", "Hui Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Hui"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
