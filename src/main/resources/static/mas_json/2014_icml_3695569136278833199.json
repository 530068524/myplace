When disagreements occur, the establishment of the correct label through trivial solutions such as majority voting may not be adequate, since without considering heterogeneity in the annotators, we risk generating a flawed model. In this paper, we generalize GP classification in order to account for multiple annotators with different levels expertise. By explicitly handling uncertainty, Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a natural framework for building proper multiple-annotator models. We empirically show that our model significantly outperforms other commonly used approaches, such as majority voting, without a significant increase in the computational cost of approximate Bayesian inference. Furthermore, an active learning methodology is proposed, which is able to reduce annotation cost even further.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Coimbra", "Singapore\u2013MIT alliance", "University of Coimbra"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Filipe Rodrigues.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodrigues:Filipe", "Francisco C.
