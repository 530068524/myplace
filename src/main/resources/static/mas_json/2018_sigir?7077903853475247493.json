{"title": "On Link Prediction in Knowledge Bases: Max-K Criterion and Prediction Protocols.", "fields": ["data mining", "artificial intelligence", "knowledge base", "embedding", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Building knowledge base embedding models for link prediction has achieved great success. We however argue that the conventional top-k criterion used for evaluating the model performance is inappropriate. This paper introduces a new criterion, referred to as max-k. Through theoretical analysis and experimental study, we show that the top-k criterion is fundamentally inferior to max-k. We also introduce two prediction protocols for the max-k criterion. These protocols are strongly justified theoretically. Various insights concerning the max-k criterion and the two protocols are obtained through extensive experiments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Beihang University", "Beihang University", "University of Ottawa", "Beihang University"], "authors": ["Jiajie Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Jiajie", "Richong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Richong", "Yongyi Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Yongyi", "Ting Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Ting"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
