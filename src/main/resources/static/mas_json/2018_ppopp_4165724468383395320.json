{"title": "A scalable distance-1 vertex coloring algorithm for power-law graphs.", "fields": ["mutual exclusion", "graph", "power law", "vertex", "scalability"], "abstract": "We propose a distributed, unordered, label-correcting distance-1 vertex coloring algorithm, called Distributed Control (DC) coloring algorithm. DC eliminates the need for vertex-centric barriers and global synchronization for color refinement, relying only on atomic operations and local termination detection to update vertex color. We implement our DC coloring algorithm and the well-known Jones-Plassmann algorithm in the AM++ AMT runtime and compare their performance. We show that, with runtime support, the elimination of waiting time of vertex-centric barriers and investing this time for local ordering results in better execution time for power-law graphs with dense local subgraphs.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["NIAC", "NIAC", "NIAC"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Jesun Sahariar Firoz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Firoz:Jesun_Sahariar", "Marcin Zalewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zalewski:Marcin", "Andrew Lumsdaine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lumsdaine:Andrew"], "pages": 2}
