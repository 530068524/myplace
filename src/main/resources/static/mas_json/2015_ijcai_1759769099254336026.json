We study the combined and data complexity of this inseparability problem for fragments of Horn-ALCHI, including the description logics underpinning OWL 2 QL and OWL 2 EL.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Birkbeck, University of London", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "University of Liverpool", "Birkbeck, University of London"], "authors": ["Elena Botoeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Botoeva:Elena", "Roman Kontchakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontchakov:Roman", "Vladislav Ryzhikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryzhikov:Vladislav", "Frank Wolter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolter:Frank", "Michael Zakharyaschev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zakharyaschev:Michael"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
