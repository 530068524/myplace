{"title": "Cross-VM side channels and their use to extract private keys.", "fields": ["elgamal encryption", "sandbox", "timing attack", "virtualization", "side channel attack"], "abstract": "This paper details the construction of an access-driven side-channel attack by which a malicious virtual machine (VM) extracts fine-grained information from a victim VM running on the same physical computer. This attack is the first such attack demonstrated on a symmetric multiprocessing system virtualized using a modern VMM (Xen). Such systems are very common today, ranging from desktops that use virtualization to sandbox application or OS compromises, to clouds that co-locate the workloads of mutually distrustful customers. Constructing such a side-channel requires overcoming challenges including core migration, numerous sources of channel noise, and the difficulty of preempting the victim with sufficient frequency to extract fine-grained information from it. This paper addresses these challenges and demonstrates the attack in a lab setting by extracting an ElGamal decryption key from a victim using the most recent version of the libgcrypt cryptographic library.", "citation": "Citations (590)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "RSA Laboratorie ... bridge, MA, USA"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Yinqian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yinqian", "Ari Juels.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juels:Ari", "Michael K.
