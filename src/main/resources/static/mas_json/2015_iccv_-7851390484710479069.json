However, to manually design useful features requires a lot of effort. In this paper, to reduce this effort, a deep learning technique, which is regarded as a tool to automatically extract useful features from raw data, is adopted. Our deep network is based on two different models. The first deep network extracts temporal appearance features from image sequences, while the other deep network extracts temporal geometry features from temporal facial landmark points. These two models are combined using a new integration method in order to boost the performance of the facial expression recognition. Through several experiments, we show that the two models cooperate with each other. As a result, we achieve superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods in the CK+ and Oulu-CASIA databases. Furthermore, we show that our new integration method gives more accurate results than traditional methods, such as a weighted summation and a feature concatenation method.", "citation": "Citations (143)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Heechul Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Heechul", "Sihaeng Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sihaeng", "Junho Yim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yim:Junho", "Sunjeong Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Sunjeong", "Junmo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Junmo"], "pages": 9}
