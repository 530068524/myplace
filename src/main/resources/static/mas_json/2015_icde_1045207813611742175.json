Despite the significant progress towards building such query interfaces to simplify visual subgraph query formulation task, construction of current generation visual interfaces is not data-driven. That is, it does not exploit the underlying data graphs to automatically generate the contents of various panels in the interface. Such data-driven construction has several benefits such as superior support for subgraph query formulation and portability of the interface across different graph databases. In this demonstration, we present a novel data-driven visual subgraph query interface construction engine called DaVinci. Specifically, it automatically generates from the underlying database two key components of the visual interface to aid subgraph query formulation, namely canned patterns and node labels.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Singapore Management University"], "authors": ["Jinbo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jinbo", "Sourav S.
