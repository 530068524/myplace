Let $H$ be a subgraph of a network $G$ where each vertex of $G$ knows which edges incident on it are in $H$. We would like to verify whether $H$ has some properties, e.g., if it is a tree or if it is connected (every node knows at the end of the process whether $H$ has the specified property or not). We would like to perform this verification in a decentralized fashion via a distributed algorithm. The time complexity of verification is measured as the number of rounds of distributed communication. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of distributed verification and give almost tight lower bounds on the running time of distributed verification algorithms for many fundamental problems such as connectivity, spanning connected subgraph, and $s$-$t$ cut verification. We then show applications of these results in deriving strong unconditional time lower bounds on the hardness of distributed approximation for many classical opt...", "citation": "Citations (188)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Google", "ETH Zurich", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Atish Das Sarma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarma:Atish_Das", "Stephan Holzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Holzer:Stephan", "Liah Kor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kor:Liah", "Amos Korman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korman:Amos", "Danupon Nanongkai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nanongkai:Danupon", "Gopal Pandurangan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandurangan:Gopal", "David Peleg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peleg:David", "Roger Wattenhofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wattenhofer:Roger"], "pages": 10}
