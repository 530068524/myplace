Personalized security indicators may help users to detect phishing attacks, but rely on the user's alertness. Previous studies in the context of website phishing have shown that users tend to ignore personalized security indicators and fall victim to attacks despite their deployment. Consequently, the research community has deemed personalized security indicators an ineffective phishing detection mechanism. We revisit the question of personalized security indicator effectiveness and evaluate them in the previously unexplored and increasingly important context of mobile applications. We conducted a user study with 221 participants and found that the deployment of personalized security indicators decreased the phishing attack success rate to 50%. Personalized security indicators can, therefore, help phishing detection in mobile applications and their reputation as an anti-phishing mechanism in the mobile context should be reconsidered.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Telef\u00f3nica", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Claudio Marforio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marforio:Claudio", "Ramya Jayaram Masti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masti:Ramya_Jayaram", "Claudio Soriente.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soriente:Claudio", "Kari Kostiainen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostiainen:Kari", "Srdjan Capkun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Capkun:Srdjan"], "pages": 12}
