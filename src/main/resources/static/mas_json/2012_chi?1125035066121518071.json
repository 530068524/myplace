We present virtual projection (VP), an interaction metaphor inspired by how we intuitively control the position, size, and orientation of a handheld optical projector's image. VP is based on tracking a handheld device without an optical projector and allows selecting a target display on which to position, scale, and orient an item in a single gesture. By relaxing the optical projection metaphor, we can deviate from modeling perspective projection, for example, to constrain scale or orientation, create multiple copies, or offset the image. VP also supports dynamic filtering based on the projection frustum, creating overview and detail applications, and selecting portions of a larger display for zooming and panning. We show exemplary use cases implemented using our optical feature-tracking framework and present the results of a user study demonstrating the effectiveness of VP in complex interactions with large displays.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "University of Calgary", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Dominikus Baur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baur:Dominikus", "Sebastian Boring.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boring:Sebastian", "Steven Feiner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feiner:Steven"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
