At present the keypad layout for Korean mobile phones has not been standardized and different manufacturers produce phones with different layouts. Included in the evaluation are three of the dominant text entry methods: Chon-ji-in, EZ-Hangul, and SKY. The metrics used in the analysis are key strokes per character, words per minute, and total error rate. The results suggest that SKY offers a good balance between speed, effort, and accuracy. The paper also introduces a phrase set that has high correlation with the Korean language and could be used in other experiments on Korean text entry methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Gettysburg College", "Gettysburg College"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ivaylo Ilinkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilinkin:Ivaylo", "Sunghee Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Sunghee"], "pages": 4}
