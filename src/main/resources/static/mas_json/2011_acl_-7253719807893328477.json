Association is modeled using a query entity click graph, blending general query click logs with vertical query click logs. Smoothing techniques are proposed to address the inherent data sparsity in such graphs, including interpolation using a query synonymy model. A large-scale empirical analysis of the smoothing techniques, over a 2-year click graph collected from a commercial search engine, shows significant reductions in modeling error. The association models are then applied to the task of recommending products to web queries, by annotating queries with products from a large catalog and then mining query-product associations through web search session analysis. Experimental analysis shows that our smoothing techniques improve coverage while keeping precision stable, and overall, that our top-performing model affects 9% of general web queries with 94% precision.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Patrick Pantel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pantel:Patrick", "Ariel Fuxman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuxman:Ariel"], "pages": 10}
