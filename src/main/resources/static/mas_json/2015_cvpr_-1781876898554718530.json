However, as a first-order regularizer, it can lead to degenerate functions in high-dimensional manifolds. The iterated graph Laplacian enables high-order regularization, but it has a high computational complexity and so cannot be applied to large problems. We introduce a new regularizer which is globally high order and so does not suffer from the degeneracy of the graph Laplacian regularizer, but is also sparse for efficient computation in semi-supervised learning applications. We reduce computational complexity by building a local first-order approximation of the manifold as a surrogate geometry, and construct our high-order regularizer based on local derivative evaluations therein. Experiments on human body shape and pose analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "MPI for Informatics, Germany"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kwang In Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kwang_In", "James Tompkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tompkin:James", "Hanspeter Pfister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfister:Hanspeter", "Christian Theobalt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobalt:Christian"], "pages": 9}
