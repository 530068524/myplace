It is much easier for a company to deploy an algorithm that is safe, i.e., guaranteed to perform at least as well as a baseline. In this paper, we study the issue of safety in contextual linear bandits that have application in many different fields including personalized ad recommendation in online marketing. We formulate a notion of safety for this class of algorithms. We develop a safe contextual linear bandit algorithm, called conservative linear UCB (CLUCB), that simultaneously minimizes its regret and satisfies the safety constraint, i.e., maintains its performance above a fixed percentage of the performance of a baseline strategy, uniformly over time. We prove an upper-bound on the regret of CLUCB and show that it can be decomposed into two terms: 1) an upper-bound for the regret of the standard linear UCB algorithm that grows with the time horizon and 2) a constant term that accounts for the loss of being conservative in order to satisfy the safety constraint. We empirically show that our algorithm is safe and validate our theoretical analysis.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Adobe Systems", "Stanford University", "DeepMind"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Abbas Kazerouni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazerouni:Abbas", "Mohammad Ghavamzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghavamzadeh:Mohammad", "Yasin Abbasi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbasi:Yasin", "Benjamin Van Roy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roy:Benjamin_Van"], "pages": 10}
