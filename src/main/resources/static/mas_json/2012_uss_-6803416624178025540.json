Despite this critical role, attackers routinely exploit browser vulnerabilities to exfiltrate private data and take over the underlying system. We present QUARK, a browser whose kernel has been implemented and verified in Coq. We give a specification of our kernel, show that the implementation satisfies the specification, and finally show that the specification implies several security properties, including tab non-interference, cookie integrity and confidentiality, and address bar integrity.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Dongseok Jang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jang:Dongseok", "Zachary Tatlock.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tatlock:Zachary", "Sorin Lerner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerner:Sorin"], "pages": 16}
