This paper describes a method to estimate the CRF from a single image of a general two-coloured surface for which the albedo ratio between the coloured regions is known a priori. While other radiometric calibration methods either use multiple frames or require the light to be infinitely distant, the algorithm herein proposed makes no assumptions about lighting conditions and can handle cameras with strong vignetting. Although the approach is generic, in the sense that can be applied to any camera system, the method is particularly well suited for determining the CRF of near-lighting endoscopes in the operating room. This is a very pertinent problem for which no practical, effective solutions have been proposed. The robustness, repeatability, and accuracy of the algorithm is experimentally validated in real images acquired with different endoscopic set-ups.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Coimbra", "University of Coimbra"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Pedro Rodrigues.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodrigues:Pedro", "Jo\u00e3o Pedro Barreto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barreto_0001:Jo=atilde=o_Pedro"], "pages": 9}
