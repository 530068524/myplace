To gain a better understanding of such user motivations, we conducted an exploratory study with four focus groups, and suggest a classification of motivations for eyes-free interaction under four categories ( environmental, social, device features, and personal ). Exploring and analyzing these categories, we present early insights pointing to design implications for future eyes-free interactions.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Microsoft", "Chalmers University of Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Bo Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Bo", "Xiang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xiang", "Morten Fjeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fjeld:Morten", "Shengdong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shengdong"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
