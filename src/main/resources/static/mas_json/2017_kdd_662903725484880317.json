A promising way is to project users and items into a Hamming space and then recommend items via Hamming distance. However, previous studies didn't address the cold-start challenges and couldn't make the best use of preference data like implicit feedback. To fill this gap, we propose a Discrete Content-aware Matrix Factorization (DCMF) model, 1) to derive compact yet informative binary codes at the presence of user/item content information; 2) to support the classification task based on a local upper bound of logit loss; 3) to introduce an interaction regularization for dealing with the sparsity issue. We further develop an efficient discrete optimization algorithm for parameter learning. Based on extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we show that DCFM outperforms the state-of-the-arts on both regression and classification tasks.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "University of Arizona", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Defu Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Defu", "Rui Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Rui", "Yong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Yong", "Kai Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0001:Kai", "Xing Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie_0001:Xing", "Longbing Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Longbing"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
