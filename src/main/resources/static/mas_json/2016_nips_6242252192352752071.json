In this paper, we propose doubly convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which significantly improve the performance of CNNs by further exploring this idea. In stead of allocating a set of convolutional filters that are independently learned, a DCNN maintains groups of filters where filters within each group are translated versions of each other. Practically, a DCNN can be easily implemented by a two-step convolution procedure, which is supported by most modern deep learning libraries. We perform extensive experiments on three image classification benchmarks: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, and show that DCNNs consistently outperform other competing architectures. We have also verified that replacing a convolutional layer with a doubly convolutional layer at any depth of a CNN can improve its performance. Moreover, various design choices of DCNNs are demonstrated, which shows that DCNN can serve the dual purpose of building more accurate models and/or reducing the memory footprint without sacrificing the accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Binghamton University", "IBM", "Tsinghua University", "Binghamton University"], "authors": ["Shuangfei Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai:Shuangfei", "Yu Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Yu", "Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhongfei_=Mark=", "Weining Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Weining"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
