{"title": "In the Heat of the Moment: Subjective Interpretations of Thermal Feedback During Interaction.", "fields": ["mobile interaction", "digital content", "interaction design", "social media", "personal experience"], "abstract": "Research has shown that thermal feedback can be an engaging and convincing means of conveying experimenter-predefined meanings, e.g., material properties or message types. However, thermal perception is subjective and its meaning in interaction can be ambiguous. Interface designers may not be sure how users could naively interpret thermal feedback during interaction. Little is also known about how users would choose thermal cues to convey their own meanings. The research in this paper tested subjective interpretations of thermal stimuli in three different scenarios: social media activity, a colleague's presence and the extent of use of digital content. Participants were also asked to assign their own thermal stimuli to personal experiences, to help us understand what kinds of stimuli people associate with different meanings. The results showed strong agreement among participants concerning what warmth (presence, activity, quality) and cool mean (absence, poor quality). Guidelines for the design of thermal feedback are presented to help others create effective thermal interfaces.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Graham A.
