{"title": "Near Unanimity Constraints Have Bounded Pathwidth Duality.", "fields": ["bounded function", "pathwidth", "nondeterministic algorithm", "duality", "weak duality"], "abstract": "We show that if a finite relational structure has a near unanimity polymorphism, then the constraint satisfaction problem with that structure as its fixed template has bounded pathwidth duality, putting the problem in nondeterministic logspace. This generalizes the analogous result of Dalmau and Krokhin for majority polymorphisms and lends further support to a conjecture suggested by Larose and Tesson.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["McMaster University", "Jagiellonian University", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Libor Barto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barto:Libor", "Marcin Kozik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozik:Marcin", "Ross Willard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Willard:Ross"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
