Our framework can be applied to any setting which roughly satisfies the following assumptions: (i) agents' types are distributed independently (not necessarily identically), (ii) objective function is additively separable over the agents, and (iii) there are no interagent constraints except for the supply constraints (i.e., that the total allocation of each item should not exceed the supply). Our framework is general in the sense that it makes no direct assumption about agents' valuations, type distributions, or single agent constraints (e.g., budget, incentive compatibility, etc.). We present two generic multiagent mechanisms which use single agent mechanisms as black boxes. If an $\\alpha$-approximate single agent mechanism is available for each agent, and assuming no agent ever demands more than $\\frac{1}{k}$ of all unit...", "citation": "Citations (106)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Saeed Alaei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alaei:Saeed"], "pages": 10}
