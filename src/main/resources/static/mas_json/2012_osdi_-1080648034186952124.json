{"title": "Making Geo-Replicated Systems Fast as Possible, Consistent when Necessary.", "fields": ["geo replication", "low latency", "replicate", "eventual consistency", "strong consistency"], "abstract": "Online services distribute and replicate state across geographically diverse data centers and direct user requests to the closest or least loaded site. While effectively ensuring low latency responses, this approach is at odds with maintaining cross-site consistency. We make three contributions to address this tension. First, we propose RedBlue consistency, which enables blue operations to be fast (and eventually consistent) while the remaining red operations are strongly consistent (and slow). Second, to make use of fast operation whenever possible and only resort to strong consistency when needed, we identify conditions delineating when operations can be blue and must be red. Third, we introduce a method that increases the space of potential blue operations by breaking them into separate generator and shadow phases. We built a coordination infrastructure called Gemini that offers RedBlue consistency, and we report on our experience modifying the TPC-W and RUBiS benchmarks and an online social network to use Gemini. Our experimental results show that RedBlue consistency provides substantial performance gains without sacrificing consistency.", "citation": "Citations (209)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Cornell University", "Universidade Nova de Lisboa"], "authors": ["Cheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Cheng", "Daniel Porto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Porto:Daniel", "Allen Clement.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clement:Allen", "Johannes Gehrke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehrke:Johannes", "Nuno M.
