General EL-TBoxes.", "fields": ["polynomial", "p", "description logic", "generalization", "decidability"], "abstract": "In the area of Description Logics the least common subsumer (lcs) and the most specific concept (msc) are inferences that generalize a set of concepts or an individual, respectively, into a single concept. If computed w.r.t. a general EL-TBox neither the lcs nor the msc need to exist. So far in this setting no exact conditions for the existence of lcs-or msc-concepts are known. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these two kinds of concepts. For the lcs of a fixed number of concepts and the msc we show decidability of the existence in PTime and polynomial bounds on the maximal role-depth of the lcs-and msc-concepts. This bound allows to compute the lcs and the msc, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Benjamin Zarrie\u00df.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zarrie=szlig=:Benjamin", "Anni-Yasmin Turhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turhan:Anni=Yasmin"], "pages": 7}
