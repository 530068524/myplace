We speak of quantum fields, entanglement, or supersymmetry, and analyze the ridiculously small or conceptualize the incomprehensibly large. Just as Willie Sutton famously explained that he robbed banks because \u201cthat\u2019s where the money is,\u201d so we do these things because \u201cthat\u2019s where the Unknown is.\u201d It is an amazing and delightful fact, however, that occasionally this sophisticated work gives answers to child-like questions about familiar things. Here I\u2019d like to describe how my own work on subnuclear forces, the world of quarks and gluons, casts brilliant new light on one such child-like question: What is the origin of mass?", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Columbia University", "University of Glasgow", "CERN", "University of Salamanca", "Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo", "U. of Edinburgh, UK", "BNL, NY", "BNL, NY"], "authors": ["Peter A.
