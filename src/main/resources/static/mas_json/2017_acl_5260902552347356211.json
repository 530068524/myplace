{"title": "Universal Dependencies Parsing for Colloquial Singaporean English.", "fields": ["singlish", "treebank", "parsing", "dependency grammar", "sentiment analysis"], "abstract": "Singlish can be interesting to the ACL community both linguistically as a major creole based on English, and computationally for information extraction and sentiment analysis of regional social media. We investigate dependency parsing of Singlish by constructing a dependency treebank under the Universal Dependencies scheme, and then training a neural network model by integrating English syntactic knowledge into a state-of-the-art parser trained on the Singlish treebank. Results show that English knowledge can lead to 25% relative error reduction, resulting in a parser of 84.47% accuracies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use neural stacking to improve cross-lingual dependency parsing on low-resource languages. We make both our annotation and parser available for further research.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Singapore University of Technology and Design", "Singapore University of Technology and Design", "DSO National Laboratories"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hongmin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hongmin", "Yue Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yue", "GuangYong Leonard Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:GuangYong_Leonard", "Jie Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jie", "Hai Leong Chieu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chieu:Hai_Leong"], "pages": 13}
