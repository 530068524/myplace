{"title": "Strong NP-Hardness for Sparse Optimization with Concave Penalty Functions.", "fields": ["data point", "time complexity", "penalty method", "optimization problem", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "Consider the regularized sparse minimization problem, which involves empirical sums of loss functions for $n$ data points (each of dimension $d$) and a nonconvex sparsity penalty. We prove that finding an $\\mathcal{O}(n^{c_1}d^{c_2})$-optimal solution to the regularized sparse optimization problem is strongly NP-hard for any $c_1, c_2\\in [0,1)$ such that $c_1+c_2<1$. The result applies to a broad class of loss functions and sparse penalty functions. It suggests that one cannot even approximately solve the sparse optimization problem in polynomial time, unless P $=$ NP.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Shanghai University of Finance and Economics", "Princeton University", "University of Minnesota", "Stanford University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yichen Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yichen", "Dongdong Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Dongdong", "Mengdi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Mengdi", "Zizhuo Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zizhuo", "Yinyu Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Yinyu", "Hao Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Hao"], "pages": 8}
