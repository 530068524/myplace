A function $f:[m]^n\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$ is an $(m,n)$-combinatorial shape if there exist sets $A_1,\\ldots,A_n\\subseteq[m]$ and a symmetric function $h:\\{0,1\\}^n\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$ such that $f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=h(1_{A_1}(x_1),\\ldots,1_{A_n}(x_n))$. Our generator uses seed-length $O(\\log m+\\log n+\\log^2(1/\\varepsilon))$ to get error $\\varepsilon$. When $m=2$, this gives the first generator of seed-length $O(\\log n)$ that fools all weight-based tests, meaning that the distribution of the weight of any subset is $\\varepsilon$-close to the appropriate binomial distribution in statistical distance. Along the way, we give a generator for combinatorial rectangles with seed-length $O(\\log^{3/2}n)$ and error $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$, matching Lu's bound from ICALP 1998. For our proof we give a simple lemma which allows us to convert closene...", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Texas at Austin", "Microsoft", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Parikshit Gopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalan:Parikshit", "Raghu Meka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meka:Raghu", "Omer Reingold.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reingold:Omer", "David Zuckerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zuckerman:David"], "pages": 10}
