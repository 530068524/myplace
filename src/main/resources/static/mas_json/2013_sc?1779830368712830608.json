DNS is a technique in which the fluid flow equations are solved without subgrid modeling. Of particular interest are high Reynolds number ( Re ) turbulent flows over walls, because of their importance in technological applications. Simulating high  Re  turbulence is a challenging computational problem, due to the high spatial and temporal resolution requirements.   An optimized code was developed using spectral methods, the method of choice for turbulent flows. Optimization was performed to address three major issues: efficiency of banded matrix linear algebra, cache reuse and memory access, and communication for the global data transposes.   Results show that performance is highly dependent on characteristics of the communication network, rather than singlecore performance. In our tests, it exhibits approximately 80% strong scaling parallel efficiency at 786K cores relative to performance on 65K cores.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Myoungkyu Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Myoungkyu", "Nicholas Malaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malaya:Nicholas", "Robert D.
