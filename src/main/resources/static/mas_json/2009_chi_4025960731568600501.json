However, turning such awareness into practical community action and political change requires more than just collecting and presenting data. To inform research on mobile environmental sensing, we conducted design fieldwork with government, private, and public interest stakeholders. In parallel, we built an environmental air quality sensing system and deployed it on street sweeping vehicles in a major U.S. city; this served as a research vehicle\"by grounding our interviews and affording us status as environmental action researchers. In this paper, we present a qualitative analysis of the landscape of environmental action, focusing on insights that will help researchers frame meaningful technological interventions.", "citation": "Citations (176)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Isopod Design,  ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Paul M.
