Memory access scheduling reorders memory requests to improve system throughput and fairness. However, it cannot resolve the interference issue effectively. To reduce interference, memory partitioning divides memory resource among threads. Memory channel partitioning maps the data of threads that are likely to severely interfere with each other to different channels. However, it allocates memory resource unfairly and physically exacerbates memory contention of intensive threads, thus ultimately resulting in the increased slowdown of these threads and high system unfairness. Bank partitioning divides memory banks among cores and eliminates interference. However, previous equal bank partitioning restricts the number of banks available to individual thread and reduces bank level parallelism.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Mingli Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Mingli", "Dong Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong_0001:Dong", "Kan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Kan", "Xu Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng_0001:Xu"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
