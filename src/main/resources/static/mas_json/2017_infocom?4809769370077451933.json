{"title": "Knitter: Fast, resilient single-user indoor floor plan construction.", "fields": ["floor plan", "data collection", "topological map", "speedup", "crowdsensing"], "abstract": "Lacking of floor plans is a fundamental obstacle to ubiquitous indoor location-based services. Recent work have made significant progress to accuracy, but they largely rely on slow crowdsensing that may take weeks or even months to collect enough data. In this paper, we propose Knitter that can generate accurate floor maps by a single random user's one hour data collection efforts. Knitter extracts high quality floor layout information from single images, calibrates user trajectories and filters outliers. It uses a multi-hypothesis map fusion framework that updates landmark positions/orientations and accessible areas incrementally according to evidences from each measurement. Our experiments on 3 different large buildings and 30+ users show that Knitter produces correct map topology, and 90-percentile landmark location and orientation errors of 3 \u223c 5m and 4 \u223c 6\u00b0, comparable to the state-of-the-art at more than 20\u00d7 speed up: data collection can finish in about one hour even by a novice user trained just a few minutes.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Beijing Jiaotong University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Ruipeng Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Ruipeng", "Bing Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Bing", "Fan Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Fan", "Yizhou Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yizhou"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
