{"title": "Pulse: low bitrate wireless magnetic communication for smartphones.", "fields": ["magnetometer", "android", "communications protocol", "pulse", "channel"], "abstract": "We present  Pulse , a wireless magnetic communication protocol for smartphones. Pulse is designed for off-the-shelf Android smartphones with magnetometers, and encodes data in magnetic fields. We present the design and evaluation of Pulse in various conditions (e.g., different voltages, number of transfer channels). The system provides security due to its short range (~1 cm), it can reach a speed of up to 44 bits per second, and it is possible to run it on most mobile phones with a magnetometer. We present our evaluation and discuss practical use cases where Pulse can be used today.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu", "University of Oulu"], "authors": ["Weiwei Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Weiwei", "Denzil Ferreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferreira:Denzil", "Jani Ylioja.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ylioja:Jani", "Jorge Gon\u00e7alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gon=ccedil=alves:Jorge", "Vassilis Kostakos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kostakos:Vassilis"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 5}
