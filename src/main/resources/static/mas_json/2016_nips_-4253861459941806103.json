We reduce the complexity of algorithm design for machine learning by reductions: we develop reductions that take a method developed for one setting and apply it to the entire spectrum of smoothness and strong-convexity in applications. Furthermore, unlike existing results, our new reductions are OPTIMAL and more PRACTICAL. We show how these new reductions give rise to new and faster running times on training linear classifiers for various families of loss functions, and conclude with experiments showing their successes also in practice.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Zeyuan Allen Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Zeyuan_Allen", "Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
