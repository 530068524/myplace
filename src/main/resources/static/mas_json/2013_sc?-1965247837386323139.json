We show that, for the codes and simulations we tested, compression levels of 3--5X can be applied without causing significant changes to important physical quantities.   Rather than applying signal processing error metrics, we utilize physics-based metrics appropriate for each code to assess the impact of compression. We evaluate three different simulation codes: a Lagrangian shock-hydrodynamics code, an Eulerian higher-order hydrodynamics turbulence modeling code, and an Eulerian coupled laser-plasma interaction code. We compress relevant quantities after each time-step to approximate the effects of tightly coupled compression and study the compression rates to estimate memory and disk-bandwidth reduction. We find that the error characteristics of compression algorithms must be carefully considered in the context of the underlying physics being modeled.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "Samplify"], "authors": ["Daniel E.
