The research method is a combination of the model-driven development (MDD) approach in software development and application of techniques in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) particularly on user- centered system design. This research involves developing a graphical modeling language which is specific to mobile applications and coming up with a generic algorithm for the conversion of this graphical model into code. The main focus of the research however, is on the design of the graphical model, and the interaction techniques which will allow non-expert people to create specialized mobile applications with case.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "authors": ["Florence T.
