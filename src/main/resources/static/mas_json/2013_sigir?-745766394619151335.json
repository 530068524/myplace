This task has been introduced at the TREC Knowledge Base Acceleration track in 2012, where two main families of approaches emerged: classification and ranking. In this paper we perform an experimental comparison of these two strategies using supervised learning with a rich feature set. Our main finding is that ranking outperforms classification on all evaluation settings and metrics. Our analysis also reveals that a ranking-based approach has more potential for future improvements.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Stavanger", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Krisztian Balog.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balog:Krisztian", "Heri Ramampiaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramampiaro:Heri"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
