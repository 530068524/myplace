Our work is inspired by Moser\u2019s entropic method proof of the Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL) for satisfiability and completely bypasses the Probabilistic Method formulation of the LLL. In particular, our method works when the underlying state space is entirely unstructured. Similarly to Moser\u2019s argument, the key point is that the inevitability of reaching a sink is established by bounding the entropy of the walk as a function of time.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Dimitris Achlioptas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achlioptas:Dimitris", "Fotis Iliopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iliopoulos:Fotis"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
