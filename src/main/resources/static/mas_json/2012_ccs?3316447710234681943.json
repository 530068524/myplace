Taking only a single round trip to perform a query, SR-ORAM has an online communication / computation cost of  O (log  n  log log  n ), and an offline, overall amortized per-query communication cost of  O (log 2   n  log log  n ), requiring under 2 round trips. The client folds an entire interactive sequence of Oblivious RAM requests into a single query object that the server can unlock incrementally, to satisfy a query without learning its result. This results in an Oblivious RAM secure against an  actively malicious  adversary, with unprecedented speeds in accessing large data sets over high-latency links. We show this to be the most efficient storage-free-client Oblivious RAM to date for today's Internet-scale network latencies.", "citation": "Citations (111)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Peter Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Peter", "Radu Sion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sion:Radu"], "pages": 12}
