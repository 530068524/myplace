The CCR task aims to detect potential citations of a set of target entities with priorities from a volume of temporally-ordered stream corpus. Previous approaches for CCR that build an individual relevance model for each entity fail to handle unseen entities without annotation. A baseline solution is to build a global entity-unspecific model for all entities regardless of the relationship information among entities, which cannot guarantee to achieve satisfactory result for each entity. In this paper, we propose a novel entity class-dependent discriminative mixture model by introducing a latent entity class layer to model the correlations between entities and latent entity classes. The model can better adjust to different types of entities and achieve better performance when dealing with a broad range of entities. An extensive set of experiments has been conducted on TREC-KBA-2013 dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Beijing Institute of Technology", "Beijing Institute of Technology", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Jingang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingang", "Dandan Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Dandan", "Qifan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qifan", "Zhiwei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhiwei", "Luo Si.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Si:Luo", "Lejian Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Lejian", "Chin-Yew Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Chin=Yew"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
