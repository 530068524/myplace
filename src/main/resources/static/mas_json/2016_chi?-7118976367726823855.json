{"title": "When Tablets meet Tabletops: The Effect of Tabletop Size on Around-the-Table Collaboration with Personal Tablets.", "fields": ["workspace", "multimedia", "group work", "display size", "sensemaking"], "abstract": "Cross-device collaboration with tablets is an increasingly popular topic in HCI. Previous work has shown that tablet-only collaboration can be improved by an additional shared workspace on an interactive tabletop. However, large tabletops are costly and need space, raising the question to what extent the physical size of shared horizontal surfaces really pays off. In order to analyse the suitability of smaller-than-tabletop devices (e.g. tablets) as a low-cost alternative, we studied the effect of the size of a shared horizontal interactive workspace on users' attention, awareness, and efficiency during cross-device collaboration. In our study, 15 groups of two users executed a sensemaking task with two personal tablets (9.7\") and a horizontal shared display of varying sizes (10.6\", 27\", and 55\"). Our findings show that different sizes lead to differences in participants' interaction with the tabletop and in the groups' communication styles. To our own surprise we found that larger tabletops do not necessarily improve collaboration or sensemaking results, because they can divert users' attention away from their collaborators and towards the shared display.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "University of Konstanz", "Aarhus University", "University of A ... s Upper Austria"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Johannes Zagermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zagermann:Johannes", "Ulrike Pfeil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfeil:Ulrike", "Roman R\u00e4dle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=dle:Roman", "Hans-Christian Jetter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jetter:Hans=Christian", "Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klokmose:Clemens_Nylandsted", "Harald Reiterer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reiterer:Harald"], "pages": 12}
