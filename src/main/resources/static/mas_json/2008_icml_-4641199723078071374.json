We investigate  structure compilation , where we replace structure with features, which are often computationally simpler but unfortunately statistically more complex. We analyze this tradeoff theoretically and empirically on three natural language processing tasks. We also introduce a simple method to transfer predictive power from structure to features via unlabeled data, while incurring a minimal statistical penalty.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Utah", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Percy Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Percy", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal", "Dan Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Dan"], "pages": 8}
