{"title": "Optimizing Quantiles in Preference-Based Markov Decision Processes.", "fields": ["optimal decision", "quantile", "partially observable markov decision process", "markov decision process", "markov model"], "abstract": "In the Markov decision process model, policies are usually evaluated by expected cumulative rewards. As this decision criterion is not always suitable, we propose in this paper an algorithm for computing a policy optimal for the quantile criterion. Both finite and infinite horizons are considered. Finally we experimentally evaluate our approach on random MDPs and on a data center control problem.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Hugo Gilbert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gilbert:Hugo", "Paul Weng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weng:Paul", "Yan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
