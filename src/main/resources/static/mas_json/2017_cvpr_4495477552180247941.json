{"title": "Context-Aware Captions from Context-Agnostic Supervision.", "fields": ["novelty", "generative grammar", "closed captioning", "discriminative model", "language model"], "abstract": "We introduce an inference technique to produce discriminative context-aware image captions (captions that describe differences between images or visual concepts) using only generic context-agnostic training data (captions that describe a concept or an image in isolation). For example, given images and captions of siamese cat and tiger cat, we generate language that describes the siamese cat in a way that distinguishes it from tiger cat. Our key novelty is that we show how to do joint inference over a language model that is context-agnostic and a listener which distinguishes closely-related concepts. We first apply our technique to a justification task, namely to describe why an image contains a particular fine-grained category as opposed to another closely-related category of the CUB-200-2011 dataset. We then study discriminative image captioning to generate language that uniquely refers to one of two semantically-similar images in the COCO dataset. Evaluations with discriminative ground truth for justification and human studies for discriminative image captioning reveal that our approach outperforms baseline generative and speaker-listener approaches for discrimination.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Idiap Research Institute", "Google", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Bar-Ilan University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ramakrishna Vedantam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vedantam:Ramakrishna", "Samy Bengio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bengio:Samy", "Kevin Murphy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murphy_0002:Kevin", "Devi Parikh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parikh:Devi", "Gal Chechik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chechik:Gal"], "pages": 10}
