{"title": "A Riemannian analysis of 3D nose shapes for partial human biometrics.", "fields": ["indexation", "stochastic process", "biometrics", "cluster analysis", "geodesic"], "abstract": "In this paper we explore the use of shapes of noses for performing partial human biometrics. The basic idea is to represent nasal surfaces using indexed collections of iso-curves, and to analyze shapes of noses by comparing their corresponding curves. We extend past work in Riemannian analysis of shapes of closed curves in \u211d 3  to obtain a similar Riemannian analysis for nasal surfaces. In particular, we obtain algorithms for computing geodesics, computing statistical means, and stochastic clustering. We demonstrate these ideas in two application contexts : authentication and identification. We evaluate performances on a large database involving 2000 scans from FRGC v2 database, and present a hierarchical organization of nose databases to allow for efficient searches.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Lille University of Science and Technology", "TELECOM Lille 1", "TELECOM Lille 1", "Departement of  ... , FL 32306, USA"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Hassen Drira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drira:Hassen", "Boulbaba Ben Amor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amor:Boulbaba_Ben", "Anuj Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Anuj", "Mohamed Daoudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daoudi:Mohamed"], "pages": 8}
