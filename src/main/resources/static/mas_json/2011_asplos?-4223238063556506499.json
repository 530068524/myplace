{"title": "Flikker: saving DRAM refresh-power through critical data partitioning.", "fields": ["total system power", "soft error", "correctness", "energy management", "runtime system"], "abstract": "Energy has become a first-class design constraint in computer systems. Memory is a significant contributor to total system power. This paper introduces Flikker, an application-level technique to reduce refresh power in DRAM memories. Flikker enables developers to specify critical and non-critical data in programs and the runtime system allocates this data in separate parts of memory. The portion of memory containing critical data is refreshed at the regular refresh-rate, while the portion containing non-critical data is refreshed at substantially lower rates. This partitioning saves energy at the cost of a modest increase in data corruption in the non-critical data. Flikker thus exposes and leverages an interesting trade-off between energy consumption and hardware correctness. We show that many applications are naturally tolerant to errors in the non-critical data, and in the vast majority of cases, the errors have little or no impact on the application's final outcome. We also find that Flikker can save between 20-25% of the power consumed by the memory sub-system in a mobile device, with negligible impact on application performance. Flikker is implemented almost entirely in software, and requires only modest changes to the hardware.", "citation": "Citations (391)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Northwestern University", "University of British Columbia", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Song Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Song", "Karthik Pattabiraman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pattabiraman:Karthik", "Thomas Moscibroda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moscibroda:Thomas", "Benjamin G.
