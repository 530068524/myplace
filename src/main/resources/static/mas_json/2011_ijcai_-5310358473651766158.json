{"title": "Expressiveness of the Interval Logics of Allen's Relations on the Class of All Linear Orders: Complete Classification.", "fields": ["computer program", "interval temporal logic", "expressivity", "discrete mathematics", "modal operator"], "abstract": "We compare the expressiveness of the fragments of Halpern and Shoham's interval logic (HS), i.e., of all interval logics with modal operators associated with Allen's relations between intervals in linear orders. We establish a complete set of inter-definability equations between these modal operators, and thus obtain a complete classification of the family of 212 fragments of HS with respect to their expressiveness. Using that result and a computer program, we have found that there are 1347 expressively different such interval logics over the class of all linear orders.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Salerno", "Technical University of Denmark", "University of Udine", "University of Murcia"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Dario Della Monica.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monica:Dario_Della", "Valentin Goranko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goranko:Valentin", "Angelo Montanari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montanari:Angelo", "Guido Sciavicco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sciavicco:Guido"], "pages": 6}
