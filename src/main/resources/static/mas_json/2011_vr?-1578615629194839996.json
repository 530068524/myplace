Our technique continuously computes visibility of pixels over the surfaces of the object and dynamically computes the per-pixel weights for each projector. This approach supports smooth transitions between areas of the object illuminated by different number of projectors, down to the illumination contribution of individual pixels within each polygon. To achieve real-time performance, we take advantage of graphics hardware, implementing much of the technique with a custom dynamic blending shader program within the GPU associated with each projector. We demonstrate the technique with some tracked objects being illuminated by three projectors.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Peter Lincoln.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lincoln:Peter", "Greg Welch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Welch:Greg", "Henry Fuchs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fuchs:Henry"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
