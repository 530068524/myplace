We have endeavored to select exhibits that achieved an interesting balance between technology and artistic intent. The techniques underpinning these artworks are relevant to several technical tracks of the conference, in particular those dealing with human-centered and interactive media. We briefly review how the various installations revisit current topics in Multimedia research, focusing more specifically on their approach to dynamic content generation, user experience, multimodality, and affective interfaces. Once again, the unique blend of technology and user experience does not limit itself to showcasing recent advances in interactive media, and should be of interest to all conference participants as well as the general public the exhibition space will be open to.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Teesside University", "InfoMus Researc ... a, Genoa, Italy"], "authors": ["Marc Cavazza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cavazza:Marc", "Antonio Camurri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camurri:Antonio"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
