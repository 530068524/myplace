Our research focuses on the longitudinal effects on performance with audio and tactile feedback, the impact of context such as location and situation on performance and personal modality preference. The results of this study indicate that crossmodal feedback can aid users in entering answers quickly and accurately using a variety of different widgets. Our study shows that there are times when audio is more appropriate than tactile and vice versa and for this reason devices should support both tactile and audio feedback to cover the widest range of environments, user preference, locations and tasks.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "authors": ["Eve E.
