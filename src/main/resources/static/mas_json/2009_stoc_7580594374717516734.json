{"title": "Non-monotone submodular maximization under matroid and knapsack constraints.", "fields": ["maximum cut", "knapsack problem", "matroid", "maximum coverage problem", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "Submodular function maximization is a central problem in combinatorial optimization, generalizing many important problems including Max Cut in directed/undirected graphs and in hypergraphs, certain constraint satisfaction problems, maximum entropy sampling, and maximum facility location problems. Unlike submodular minimization, submodular maximization is NP-hard. In this paper, we give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for maximizing any non-negative submodular function subject to multiple matroid or knapsack constraints. We emphasize that our results are for  non-monotone  submodular functions. In particular, for any constant k, we present a (1/k+2+1/k+e)-approximation for the submodular maximization problem under k matroid constraints, and a (1/5-e)-approximation algorithm for this problem subject to k knapsack constraints (e>0 is any constant). We improve the approximation guarantee of our algorithm to 1/k+1+{1/k-1}+e for k\u22652 partition matroid constraints. This idea also gives a ({1/k+e)-approximation for maximizing a  monotone  submodular function subject to k\u22652 partition matroids, which improves over the previously best known guarantee of 1/k+1.", "citation": "Citations (170)", "departments": ["IBM", "Google", "Carnegie Mellon University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Jon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Jon", "Vahab S.
