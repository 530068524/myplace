Inspired by recent work on Sobolev active contours we derive a Sobolev-type function space for polar curves. This so-called polar space is endowed with a metric that allows us to favor origin translations and scale changes over smooth deformations of the curve. Moreover, the resulting curve flow inherits the coarse-to-fine behavior of Sobolev active contours and is thus very robust to local minima. These properties make the resulting polar active contours a powerful segmentation tool for many medical applications, such as cross-sectional vessel segmentation, aneurysm analysis, or cell tracking.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Sabanc\u0131 University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Maximilian Baust.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baust:Maximilian", "Anthony J.
