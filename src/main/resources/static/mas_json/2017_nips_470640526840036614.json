By exploiting the noise correlations among different responses, we propose an alternating estimation (AltEst) procedure to estimate the model parameters based on the generalized Dantzig selector (GDS). Under suitable sample size and resampling assumptions, we show that the error of the estimates generated by AltEst, with high probability, converges linearly to certain minimum achievable level, which can be tersely expressed by a few geometric measures, such as Gaussian width of sets related to the parameter structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-asymptotic statistical guarantee for such AltEst-type algorithm applied to estimation with general structures.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Sheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Sheng", "Arindam Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Arindam"], "pages": 10}
