However, MBR targeting BLEU is prohibitively slow to optimize over k-best lists for large k. In this paper, we introduce and analyze an alternative to MBR that is equally effective at improving performance, yet is asymptotically faster --- running 80 times faster than MBR in experiments with 1000-best lists. Furthermore, our fast decoding procedure can select output sentences based on distributions over entire forests of translations, in addition to k-best lists. We evaluate our procedure on translation forests from two large-scale, state-of-the-art hierarchical machine translation systems. Our forest-based decoding objective consistently outperforms k-best list MBR, giving improvements of up to 1.0 BLEU.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["John DeNero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeNero:John", "David Chiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiang_0001:David", "Kevin Knight.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knight:Kevin"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
