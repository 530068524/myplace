Standard PIMC has well-known shortcomings in the accuracy of its decisions, but has the advantage of being simple, fast, robust and scalable, making it well-suited for imperfect information games with large state-spaces. We propose Presumed Value PIMC resolving the problem of overestimation of opponent's knowledge of hidden information in future game states. The resulting AI agent was tested against human experts in Schnapsen, a Central European 2-player trick-taking card game, and performs above human expert-level.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Florian Wisser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wisser:Florian"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
