However, such technique usually requires an expensive and professional setup and is time-consuming because a conventional hyperspectral image consists of a large number of observations. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of one-shot hyperspectral imaging using faced reflectors on which color filters are attached. The key idea is based on the principle that each of multiple reflections on the filters has a different spectrum, which allows us to observe multiple intensities through different spectra. Our technique can be implemented either by a coupled mirror or a kaleidoscope geometry. Experimental results show that our technique is capable of accurately capturing a hyperspectral image by using a coupled mirror setup which is readily available.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tsuyoshi Takatani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takatani:Tsuyoshi", "Takahito Aoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aoto_0002:Takahito", "Yasuhiro Mukaigawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukaigawa:Yasuhiro"], "pages": 9}
