{"title": "Multimodal Affective Analysis Using Hierarchical Attention Strategy with Word-Level Alignment.", "fields": ["affect", "natural language processing", "architecture", "affective computing", "modalities"], "abstract": "Multimodal affective computing, learning to recognize and interpret human affects and subjective information from multiple data sources, is still challenging because: (i) it is hard to extract informative features to represent human affects from heterogeneous inputs; (ii) current fusion strategies only fuse different modalities at abstract level, ignoring time-dependent interactions between modalities. Addressing such issues, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal architecture with attention and word-level fusion to classify utter-ance-level sentiment and emotion from text and audio data. Our introduced model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on published datasets and we demonstrated that our model is able to visualize and interpret the synchronized attention over modalities.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yue Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Yue", "Kangning Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Kangning", "Shiyu Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Shiyu", "Shuhong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shuhong", "Xinyu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xinyu", "Ivan Marsic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marsic:Ivan"], "pages": 11}
