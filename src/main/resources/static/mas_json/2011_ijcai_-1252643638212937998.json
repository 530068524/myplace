In this paper, we study the dynamics of coalition formation under bounded rationality. We consider settings whereby each team\u2019s profit is given by a submodular function and propose three profit-sharing schemes, each of which is based on the concept of marginal utility. The agents are assumed to be myopic, i.e., they keep changing teams as long as they can increase their payoff by doing so. We study the properties (such as closeness to Nash equilibrium or total profit) of the states that result after a polynomial number of such moves, and prove bounds on the price of anarchy and the price of stability of the corresponding games.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Madras", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["John Augustine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Augustine:John", "Ning Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ning", "Edith Elkind.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elkind:Edith", "Angelo Fanelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fanelli_0001:Angelo", "Nick Gravin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gravin:Nick", "Dmitry Shiryaev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shiryaev:Dmitry"], "pages": 6}
