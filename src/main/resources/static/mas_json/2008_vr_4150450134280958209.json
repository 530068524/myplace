{"title": "Evaluation of Reorientation Techniques for Walking in Large Virtual Environments.", "fields": ["virtual machine", "virtual reality", "redirected walking", "user interface", "interaction technique"], "abstract": "Virtual environments (VEs) that use a real-walking locomotion interface have typically been restricted in size to the area of the tracked lab space. Techniques proposed to lift this size constraint, enabling real walking in VEs that are larger than the tracked lab space, all require reorientation techniques (ROTs) in the worst-case situation-when a user is close to walking out of the tracked space. We propose a new ROT using distractors-objects in the VE for the user to focus on while the VE rotates and compare our method to current ROTs through two user studies. Our findings show ROTs using distractors were preferred and ranked more natural by users. Users were also less aware of the rotating VE, when ROTs with distractors were used.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Tabitha C.
