In this paper, we address this question by introducing a generalization of the maximum entropy principle. Applying this principle to sets of distributions with marginal on X constrained to be the empirical marginal, we provide a minimax interpretation of the maximum likelihood problem over generalized linear models as well as some popular regularization schemes. For quadratic and logarithmic loss functions we revisit well-known linear and logistic regression models. Moreover, for the 0-1 loss we derive a classifier which we call the minimax SVM. The minimax SVM minimizes the worst-case expected 0-1 loss over the proposed \u0393 by solving a tractable optimization problem. We perform several numerical experiments to show the power of the minimax SVM in outperforming the SVM.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Farzan Farnia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farnia:Farzan", "David Tse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tse:David"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
