It is important and necessary, therefore, to enhance our ability to computationally determine whether some statement of fact is true or false. We view this problem as a link-prediction task in a knowledge graph, and present a discriminative path-based method for fact checking in knowledge graphs that incorporates connectivity, type information, and predicate interactions. Given a statement S of the form (subject, predicate, object), for example, (Chicago, capitalOf, Illinois), our approach mines discriminative paths that alternatively define the generalized statement (U.S. city, predicate, U.S. state) and uses the mined rules to evaluate the veracity of statement S . We evaluate our approach by examining thousands of claims related to history, geography, biology, and politics using a public, million node knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia and PubMedDB. Not only does our approach significantly outperform related models, we also find that the discriminative predicate path model is easily interpretable and provides sensible reasons for the final determination.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Notre Dame", "University of Notre Dame", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Bar-Ilan University", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Academia Sinica", "Rutgers University", "University of Notre Dame", "University of Notre Dame", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Laboratoire d'I ... , France 13453", "1,CHEN Ying 2,Li Min-qiang 1"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Peter Niebert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niebert:Peter", "Doron A.
