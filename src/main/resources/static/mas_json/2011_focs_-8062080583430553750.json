{"title": "Privacy Amplification and Non-malleable Extractors via Character Sums.", "fields": ["prime number", "number theory", "randomness extractor", "character sum", "entropy rate"], "abstract": "In studying how to communicate over a public channel with an active adversary, Dodis and Wichs introduced the notion of a non-malleable extractor. A non-malleable extractor dramatically strengthens the notion of a strong extractor. A strong extractor takes two inputs, a weakly-random $x$ and a uniformly random seed $y$, and outputs a string which appears uniform, even given $y$. For a non-malleable extractor $\\nm$, the output $\\nm(x,y)$ should appear uniform given $y$ as well as $\\nm(x,\\adv(y))$, where $\\adv$ is an arbitrary function with $\\adv(y) \\neq y$. We show that an extractor introduced by Chor and Gold reich is non-malleable when the entropy rate is above half. It outputs a linear number of bits when the entropy rate is $1/2 + \\alpha$, for any $\\alpha>0$. Previously, no nontrivial parameters were known for any non-malleable extractor. To achieve a polynomial running time when outputting many bits, we rely on a widely-believed conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions. Our analysis involves a character sum estimate, which may be of independent interest. Using our non-malleable extractor, we obtain protocols for ``privacy amplification & quot;: key agreement between two parties who share a weakly-random secret. Our protocols work in the presence of an active adversary with unlimited computational power, and have asymptotically optimal entropy loss. When the secret has entropy rate greater than $1/2$, the protocol follows from a result of Dodis and Wichs, and takes two rounds. When the secret has entropy rate $\\delta$ for any constant~$\\delta>0$, our new protocol takes a constant (polynomial in $1/\\delta$) number of rounds. Our protocols run in polynomial time under the above well-known conjecture about primes.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["New York University", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "School of Mathematics"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Yevgeniy Dodis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dodis:Yevgeniy", "Xin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0006:Xin", "Trevor D.
