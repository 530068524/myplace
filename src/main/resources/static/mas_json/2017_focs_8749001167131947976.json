In particular, this means that many query complexity separations involving randomized models (e.g., classical vs. quantum) automatically imply analogous separations in communication complexity.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Memphis"], "authors": ["Mika G\u00f6\u00f6s.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml==ouml=s:Mika", "Toniann Pitassi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitassi:Toniann", "Thomas Watson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watson_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
