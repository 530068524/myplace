HE is designed to produce a ciphertext which, when decrypted with any of a number of incorrect keys, yields plausible-looking but bogus plaintexts called honey messages. A key benefit of HE is that it provides security in cases where too little entropy is available to withstand brute-force attacks that try every key; in this sense, HE provides security beyond conventional brute-force bounds. HE can also provide a hedge against partial disclosure of high min-entropy keys.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Ari Juels.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Juels:Ari", "Thomas Ristenpart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ristenpart:Thomas"], "pages": 18}
