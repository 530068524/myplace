{"title": "Transportability from Multiple Environments with Limited Experiments: Completeness Results.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "machine learning", "completeness", "artificial intelligence", "experimental data"], "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of mz-transportability, that is, transferring causal knowledge collected in several heterogeneous domains to a target domain in which only passive observations and limited experimental data can be collected. The paper first establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding the feasibility of mz-transportability, i.e., whether causal effects in the target domain are estimable from the information available. It further proves that a previously established algorithm for computing transport formula is in fact complete, that is, failure of the algorithm implies non-existence of a transport formula. Finally, the paper shows that the do-calculus is complete for the mz-transportability class.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Elias Bareinboim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bareinboim:Elias", "Judea Pearl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pearl:Judea"], "pages": 9}
