A preliminary experiment has been performed involving 10 tuba players. The recordings have been analysed by extracting a variety of features, which have been subsequently evaluated by combining both classic and machine learning statistical techniques. Results are reported and discussed.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Milan", "University of Milan", "University of Milan"], "authors": ["Alberto Introini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Introini:Alberto", "Giorgio Presti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Presti:Giorgio", "Giuseppe Boccignone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boccignone:Giuseppe"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
