We conducted a two-month field study of current behaviors and attitudes around printing, and the results confirmed the affordances of paper, but also revealed many problems associated with printing web content. We then designed and implemented a browser extension, PrintMarmoset, that targets these problems while simultaneously addressing user needs and environmental responsibility. It allows users to effortless select or remove web content for printing. We have also incorporated a data sharing mechanism into our solution to assist in the adoption of the tool and created visualizations to encourage user reflection and exploration.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Jun Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Jun", "Jian Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Jian"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
