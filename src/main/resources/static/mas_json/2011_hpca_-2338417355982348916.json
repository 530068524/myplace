Bug diagnosis is the most difficult step during post-silicon validation. Limited reproducibility and low testing speeds are common limitations in current testing techniques. Moreover, low observability defies full-speed testing approaches. Modern solutions like on-chip trace buffers alleviate these issues, but are unable to store long activity traces. As a consequence, the cost of post-Si validation now represents a large fraction of the total design cost. This work describes a hybrid post-Si approach to validate a modern load-store queue. We use an effective error detection mechanism and an expandable logging mechanism to observe the microarchitectural activity for long periods of time, at processor full-speed. Validation is performed by analyzing the log activity by means of a diagnosis algorithm. Correct memory ordering is checked to root the cause of errors.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia"], "authors": ["Javier Carretero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carretero:Javier", "Xavier Vera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vera:Xavier", "Jaume Abella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abella:Jaume", "Tanaus\u00fa Ram\u00edrez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ram=iacute=rez:Tanaus=uacute=", "Matteo Monchiero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monchiero:Matteo", "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonz=aacute=lez_0001:Antonio"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2011", "pages": 11}
