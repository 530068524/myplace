We introduce exchangeable variable models (EVMs) as a novel class of probabilistic models whose basic building blocks are partially exchangeable sequences, a generalization of exchangeable sequences. We prove that a family of tractable EVMs is optimal under zeroone loss for a large class of functions, including parity and threshold functions, and strictly subsumes existing tractable independence-based model families. Extensive experiments show that EVMs outperform state of the art classifiers such as SVMs and probabilistic models which are solely based on independence assumptions.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Mathias Niepert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niepert:Mathias", "Pedro M.
