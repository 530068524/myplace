The data in Freebase is collaboratively created, structured, and maintained. Freebase currently contains more than 125,000,000 tuples, more than 4000 types, and more than 7000 properties. Public read/write access to Freebase is allowed through an HTTP-based graph-query API using the Metaweb Query Language (MQL) as a data query and manipulation language. MQL provides an easy-to-use object-oriented interface to the tuple data in Freebase and is designed to facilitate the creation of collaborative, Web-based data-oriented applications.", "citation": "Citations (1,952)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Metaweb Technol ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Metaweb Technol ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Metaweb Technol ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Metaweb Technol ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Metaweb Technol ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kurt D.
