Compared with traditional markers with square pattern, our random dot markers have several significant advantages for flexible marker design, robustness against occlusion and user interaction. The retrieval and tracking of these markers are based on geometric feature based keypoint matching and tracking. We experimentally demonstrate that the discriminative ability of forty random dots per marker is applicable for retrieving up to one thousand markers.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["Keio University", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Hideaki Uchiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uchiyama:Hideaki", "Hideo Saito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saito:Hideo"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
