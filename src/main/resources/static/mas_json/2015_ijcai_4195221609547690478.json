In this problem, extracting effective features for identifying activities is a critical but challenging task. Most existing work relies on heuristic hand-crafted feature design and shallow feature learning architectures, which cannot find those distinguishing features to accurately classify different activities. In this paper, we propose a systematic feature learning method for HAR problem. This method adopts a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automate feature learning from the raw inputs in a systematic way. Through the deep architecture, the learned features are deemed as the higher level abstract representation of low level raw time series signals. By leveraging the labelled information via supervised learning, the learned features are endowed with more discriminative power. Unified in one model, feature learning and classification are mutually enhanced. All these unique advantages of the CNN make it outperform other HAR algorithms, as verified in the experiments on the Opportunity Activity Recognition Challenge and other benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Citations (186)", "departments": ["Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research"], "authors": ["Jianbo Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jianbo", "Minh Nhut Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Minh_Nhut", "Phyo Phyo San.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/San:Phyo_Phyo", "Xiaoli Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiaoli", "Shonali Krishnaswamy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnaswamy:Shonali"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
