Existing solutions provide multi- keyword exact search that does not tolerate keyword spelling error, or single keyword fuzzy search that tolerates typos to certain extent. The current fuzzy search schemes rely on building an expanded index that covers possible keyword misspelling, which lead to significantly larger index file size and higher search complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel multi- keyword fuzzy search scheme by exploiting the locality-sensitive hashing technique. Our proposed scheme achieves fuzzy matching through algorithmic design rather than expanding the index file. It also eliminates the need of a predefined dictionary and effectively supports multiple keyword fuzzy search without increasing the index or search complexity. Extensive analysis and experiments on real-world data show that our proposed scheme is secure, efficient and accurate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves multi-keyword fuzzy search over encrypted cloud data.", "citation": "Citations (225)", "departments": ["University of Arkansas at Little Rock", "Virginia Polyte ... ksburg, VA, USA", "Virginia Polyte ... ksburg, VA, USA", "Virginia Polyte ... ksburg, VA, USA"], "authors": ["Bing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0005:Bing", "Shucheng Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Shucheng", "Wenjing Lou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lou:Wenjing", "Y.
