{"title": "Bootstrapping Distantly Supervised IE Using Joint Learning and Small Well-Structured Corpora.", "fields": ["document structure description", "graph", "natural language processing", "relationship extraction", "bootstrapping"], "abstract": "We propose a framework to improve performance of distantly-supervised relation extraction, by jointly learning to solve two related tasks: concept-instance extraction and relation extraction. We combine this with a novel use of document structure: in some small, well-structured corpora, sections can be identified that correspond to relation arguments, and distantly-labeled examples from such sections tend to have good precision. Using these as seeds we extract additional relation examples by applying label propagation on a graph composed of noisy examples extracted from a large unstructured testing corpus. Combined with the soft constraint that concept examples should have the same type as the second argument of the relation, we get significant improvements over several state-of-the-art approaches to distantly-supervised relation extraction.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Qualcomm", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Lidong Bing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bing:Lidong", "Bhuwan Dhingra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhingra:Bhuwan", "Kathryn Mazaitis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazaitis:Kathryn", "Jong Hyuk Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jong_Hyuk", "William W.
