Sindbad supports three new services beyond traditional social networking services, namely,  location-aware news feed, location-aware recommender , and  location-aware ranking . These new services not only consider social relevance for its users, but they also consider spatial relevance. Since location-aware social networking systems have to deal with large number of users, large number of messages, and user mobility, efficiency and scalability are important issues. To this end, Sindbad encapsulates its three main services inside the query processing engine of PostgreSQL. Usage and internal functionality of Sindbad, implemented with PostgreSQL and Google Maps API, are demonstrated through user (i.e., web/phone) and system analyzer GUI interfaces, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "Microsoft", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Mohamed Sarwat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sarwat:Mohamed", "Jie Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao_0003:Jie", "Ahmed Eldawy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eldawy:Ahmed", "Justin J.
