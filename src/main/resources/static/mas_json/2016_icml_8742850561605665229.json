We then use these tasks to systematically compare and contrast existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architectures with our new memory-based DRL architectures. These tasks are designed to emphasize, in a controllable manner, issues that pose challenges for RL methods including partial observability (due to first-person visual observations), delayed rewards, high-dimensional visual observations, and the need to use active perception in a correct manner so as to perform well in the tasks. While these tasks are conceptually simple to describe, by virtue of having all of these challenges simultaneously they are difficult for current DRL architectures. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization performance of the architectures on environments not used during training. The experimental results show that our new architectures generalize to unseen environments better than existing DRL architectures.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Junhyuk Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Junhyuk", "Valliappa Chockalingam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chockalingam:Valliappa", "Satinder P.
