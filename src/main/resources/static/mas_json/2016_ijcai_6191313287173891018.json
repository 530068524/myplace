In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality hashing algorithm termed Supervised Matrix Factorization Hashing (SMFH) which tackles the multi-modal hashing problem with a collective non-negative matrix factorization across the different modalities. In particular, SMFH employs a well-designed binary code learning algorithm to preserve the similarities among multi-modal original features through a graph regularization. At the same time, semantic labels, when available, are incorporated into the learning procedure. We conjecture that all these would facilitate to preserve the most relevant information during the binary quantization process, and hence improve the retrieval accuracy. We demonstrate the superior performance of SMFH on three cross-modality visual search benchmarks, i.e., the PASCAL-Sentence, Wiki, and NUS-WIDE, with quantitative comparison to various state-of-the-art methods [Kumar and Udupa, 2011; Rastegari et al., 2013; Zhang and Li, 2014; Ding et al., 2014].", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Xiamen University", "Xiamen University", "Tencent", "Microsoft"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Hong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0009:Hong", "Rongrong Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Rongrong", "Yongjian Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yongjian", "Gang Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Gang"], "pages": 7}
