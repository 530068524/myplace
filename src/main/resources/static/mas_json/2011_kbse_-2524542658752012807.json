{"title": "Toward consistency checking of natural language temporal requirements.", "fields": ["natural language programming", "temporal annotation", "language of temporal ordering specification", "object language", "data control language"], "abstract": "We discuss the problem of identifying inconsistencies in temporal requirements expressed as natural language text. We propose a partially automated approach that aims to minimize analysts' workload and improve accuracy. As one of the ingredients of the approach, we introduce a formal language to represent temporal requirements precisely and unambiguously. We call this language Temporal Action Language (TAL).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Kentucky"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Wenbin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenbin"], "pages": 5}
