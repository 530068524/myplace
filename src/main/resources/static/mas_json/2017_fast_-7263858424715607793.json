For non-sequential workloads, these disks show bimodal behavior: After a short period of high throughput they enter a continuous period of low throughput.\n\nWe introduce ext4-lazy, a small change to the Linux ext4 file system that significantly improves the throughput in both modes. We present benchmarks on four different drive-managed SMR disks from two vendors, showing that ext4-lazy achieves 1.7-5.4\u00d7 improvement over ext4 on a metadata-light file server benchmark. On metadata-heavy benchmarks it achieves 2-13\u00d7 improvement over ext4 on drive-managed SMR disks as well as on conventional disks.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Google", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Abutalib Aghayev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aghayev:Abutalib", "Theodore Y.
