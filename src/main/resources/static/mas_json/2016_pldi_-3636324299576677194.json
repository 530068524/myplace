{"title": "GreenWeb: language extensions for energy-efficient mobile web computing.", "fields": ["mobile web", "mobile device", "energy budget", "android", "web modeling"], "abstract": "Web computing is gradually shifting toward mobile devices, in which the energy budget is severely constrained. As a result, Web developers must be conscious of energy efficiency. However, current Web languages provide developers little control over energy consumption. In this paper, we take a first step toward language-level research to enable energy-efficient Web computing. Our key motivation is that mobile systems can wisely budget energy usage if informed with user quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. To do this, programmers need new abstractions. We propose two language abstractions, QoS type and QoS target, to capture two fundamental aspects of user QoS experience. We then present GreenWeb, a set of language extensions that empower developers to easily express the QoS abstractions as program annotations. As a proof of concept, we develop a GreenWeb runtime, which intelligently determines how to deliver specified user QoS expectation while minimizing energy consumption. Overall, GreenWeb shows significant energy savings (29.2% \u223c 66.0%) over Android\u2019s default Interactive governor with few QoS violations. Our work demonstrates a promising first step toward language innovations for energy-efficient Web computing.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Yuhao Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yuhao", "Vijay Janapa Reddi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reddi:Vijay_Janapa"], "conf": "pldi", "year": "2016", "pages": 16}
