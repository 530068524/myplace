This result immediately gives a polynomial-time, truthful (in expectation) mechanism whose approximation guarantee attains the best-possible one for all polynomial-time algorithms (assuming P not equal to NP). Our algorithmic techniques are flexible and also yield, among other results, a monotone deterministic quasi-PTAS for Q||C max  and a monotone randomized PTAS for max-min scheduling on related machines.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Peerapong Dhangwatnotai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhangwatnotai:Peerapong", "Shahar Dobzinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobzinski:Shahar", "Shaddin Dughmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dughmi:Shaddin", "Tim Roughgarden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roughgarden:Tim"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
