In this paper, we propose the next hop of strict partial order to construct and aggregate the Nexthop-Selectable FIB (NSFIB). We control the path stretch caused by NSFIB aggregation by setting an upper limit number of next hops. According to our simulation, our aggregation algorithms shrink the FIB to 5-15%, compared with 20-60% of single-nexthop FIB aggregation algorithms; our method works very well in controlling the path stretch.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Qing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0006:Qing", "Mingwei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Mingwei", "Meng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Meng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
