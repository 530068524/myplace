However, there exists no overarching account of what children are doing when they learn about preferences or how they use that knowledge. We use a rational model of preference learning, drawing on ideas from economics and computer science, to explain the behavior of children in several recent experiments. Specifically, we show how a simple econometric model can be extended to capture two- to four-year-olds' use of statistical information in inferring preferences, and their generalization of these preferences.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of British Columbia", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Christopher G.
