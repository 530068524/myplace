The main concern for network operators and vendors is the unfavorable propagation characteristics due to short wavelength and high directionality, which renders the 60 GHz links highly vulnerable to blockage and mobility. However, the advent of multi-band chipsets opens the possibility of leveraging the more robust WiFi technology to assist 60 GHz in order to provide seamless, Gbps connectivity. In this paper, we design and implement MUST, an IEEE 802.11-compliant system that provides seamless, high-speed connectivity over multi-band 60 GHz and WiFi devices. MUST has two key design components: (1) a WiFi-assisted 60 GHz link adaptation algorithm, which can instantaneously predict the best beam and PHY rate setting, with zero probing overhead; and (2) a proactive blockage detection and switching algorithm which can re-direct ongoing user traffic to the robust interface within sub-10 ms latency. Our experiments with off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware show that MUST can achieve 25-60% throughput gain over state-of-the-art solutions, while bringing almost 2 orders of magnitude cross-band switching latency improvement.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Hewlett-Packard", "University of California, San Diego", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Sanjib Sur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sur:Sanjib", "Ioannis Pefkianakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pefkianakis:Ioannis", "Xinyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xinyu", "Kyu-Han Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kyu=Han"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
