The construction generalizes the way degree-d, univariate polynomials evaluated over the q-element field (also known as Reed-Solomon codes) are \"lifted\" to degree-d, m-variate polynomials (Reed-Muller codes). A number of properties are established: The rate of the degree-lifted code is approximately a 1/m!-fraction of the rate of the base-code. The relative distance of the degree-lifted code is at least as large as that of the base-code. This is proved using a generalization of the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma to degree-lifted Algebraic-Geometry codes. [Local correction] If the base code is invariant under a group that is \"close\" to being doubly-transitive (in a precise manner defined later then the degree-lifted code is locally correctable with query complexity at most q 2 . The automorphisms of the base-code are crucially used to generate query-sets, abstracting the use of affine-lines in the local correction procedure of Reed-Muller codes. Taking a concrete illustrating example, we show that degree-lifted Hermitian codes form a family of locally correctable codes over an alphabet that is significantly smaller than that obtained by Reed-Muller codes of similar constant rate, message length, and distance.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Eli Ben-Sasson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Sasson:Eli", "Ariel Gabizon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gabizon:Ariel", "Yohay Kaplan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaplan:Yohay", "Swastik Kopparty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopparty:Swastik", "Shubhangi Saraf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saraf:Shubhangi"], "pages": 10}
