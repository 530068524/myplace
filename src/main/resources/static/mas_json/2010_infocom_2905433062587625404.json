The major challenge in realizing the strategy is how to minimize the system maintenance cost, especially the frequency in replacing sensor nodes with limited number of backup nodes. New duty cycle scheduling schemes are required in order to address the challenge. Tong et al. have proposed a staircase-based scheme to address the problem based on ideal assumptions of sensor nodes that are free of failure and have regular energy consumption rate. Since sensor nodes are often deployed in outdoor unattended environment, node failures are inevitable. Energy consumption rates of sensor nodes are irregular due to manufacture or environmental reasons. Hence, this paper proposes several new schemes to achieve reliable scheduling for node reclamation and replacement. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify that the proposed scheme is effective and efficient.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Bin Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Bin", "Zi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zi", "Guiling Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Guiling", "Wensheng Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Wensheng"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
