Our mode of operation performs twice as fast as the original double-piped mode of operation of Lucks [15] while providing comparable security. Our construction, which uses a class of polynomial-based compression functions proposed by Stam [22,23], makes a single call to a 3n-bit to n-bit primitive at each iteration and uses a finalization function f2 at the last iteration, producing an n-bit hash function H[f1,f2] satisfying the following properties.\n\nH[f1,f2] is unforgeable up to O(2n/n) query complexity as long as f1 and f2 are unforgeable.\n\nH[f1,f2] is pseudorandom up to O(2n/n) query complexity as long as f1 is unforgeable and f2 is pseudorandom.\n\nH[f1,f2] is indifferentiable from a random oracle up to O(22n/3) query complexity as long as f1 and f2 are public random functions.\n\nTo our knowledge, our result constitutes the first time O(2n/n) unforgeability has been achieved using only an unforgeable primitive of n-bit output length. (Yasuda showed unforgeability of O(25n/6) for Lucks\u2019 construction assuming an unforgeable primitive, but the analysis is sub-optimal; in the appendix, we show how Yasuda\u2019s bound can be improved to O(2n).)\n\nIn related work, we strengthen Stam\u2019s collision resistance analysis of polynomial-based compression functions (showing that unforgeability of the primitive suffices) and discuss how to implement our mode by replacing f1 with a 2n-bit key blockcipher in Davies-Meyer mode or by replacing f1 with the cascade of two 2n-bit to n-bit compression functions.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Jooyoung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee_0001:Jooyoung", "John P.
