{"title": "Display Blindness?: Looking Again at the Visibility of Situated Displays using Eye-tracking.", "fields": ["blindness", "eye tracking", "multimedia", "situated", "visibility"], "abstract": "Observational studies of situated displays have suggested that they are rarely looked at, and when they are it is typically only for a short period of time. Using a mobile eye tracker during a realistic shopping task in a shopping center, we show that people look at displays more than would be predicted from these observational studies, but still only short glances and often from quite far away. We characterize the patterns of eye-movements that precede looking at a display and discuss some of the design implications for the design of situated display technologies that are deployed in public space.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Open University", "University College London", "University College London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Nicholas Sheep Dalton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dalton:Nicholas_Sheep", "Emily Collins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collins:Emily", "Paul Marshall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marshall:Paul"], "pages": 10}
