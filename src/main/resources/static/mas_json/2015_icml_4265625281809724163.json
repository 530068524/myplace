{"title": "Attribute Efficient Linear Regression with Distribution-Dependent Sampling.", "fields": ["sampling", "machine learning", "linear regression", "pattern recognition", "lasso"], "abstract": "We consider a budgeted learning setting, where the learner can only choose and observe a small subset of the attributes of each training example. We develop efficient algorithms for Ridge and Lasso linear regression, which utilize the geometry of the data by a novel distribution-dependent sampling scheme, and have excess risk bounds which are better a factor of up to O(\u221ad/k) over the state-of-the-art, where d is the dimension and k + 1 is the number of observed attributes per example. Moreover, under reasonable assumptions, our algorithms are the first in our setting which can provably use less attributes than full-information algorithms, which is the main concern in budgeted learning. We complement our theoretical analysis with experiments which support our claims.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Doron Kukliansky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kukliansky:Doron", "Ohad Shamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamir:Ohad"], "pages": 9}
