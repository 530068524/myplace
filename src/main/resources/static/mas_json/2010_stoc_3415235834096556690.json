For the weighted setting, very few results are known with approximation guarantees better than that for the combinatorial set cover problem. In this article, we employ the idea of quasi-uniform sampling to obtain improved approximation guarantees in the weighted setting for a large class of problems for which such guarantees were known in the unweighted case. As a consequence of this sampling method, we obtain new results on the fractional set cover packing problem.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Iowa"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Kasturi R.
