The proposed model yields discrete analog to the prevailing model with diffusion tensor-based regularizer, which has been optimized by variational approach. Inspired from the fact that the regularization process works as a convolution kernel filtering, we formulate the difference between original flow and filtered flow as a smoothness prior. Then the discrete framework enables us to employ a robust penalizer less concerning convexity and differentiability of the energy function. In addition, we provide a new kernel design based on the bilateral filter, adaptively controlling intensity variance according to the local statistics. The proposed kernel simultaneously addresses over-segmentation and over-smoothing problems, which is hard to achieve by tuning parameters. Involving a complex graph structure with large label sets, this work also presents a strategy to efficiently reduce memory requirement and computational time to a tolerable state. Experimental result shows the proposed method yields plausible results on the various data sets including large displacement and textured region.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["School of EECS, ...  151-742, Korea", "School of EECS, ...  151-742, Korea", "School of EIE,  ...  449-791, Korea", "School of EECS, ...  151-742, Korea"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kyong Joon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kyong_Joon", "Dongjin Kwon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwon:Dongjin", "Il Dong Yun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yun:Il_Dong", "Sang Uk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Sang_Uk"], "pages": 8}
