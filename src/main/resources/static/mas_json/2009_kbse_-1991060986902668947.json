{"title": "Towards Augmenting Requirements Models with Preferences.", "fields": ["software requirements specification", "requirement", "goal modeling", "requirements analysis", "stakeholder"], "abstract": "The analysis of stakeholder requirements is a critical aspect of software engineering. A common way of specifying stakeholder requirements is in terms of a hierarchy of goals whose AND/OR decomposition captures a family of software solutions that comply with the goals. In this paper, we extend this goal modeling framework to include the specification of optional user requirements and user preferences, aggregated together into weighted formulae to be optimized. We team this with an automated reasoning tool, adapted from state of the art research in artificial intelligence planning with preferences, in order to synthesize solutions that both comply with the goals and optimize stakeholder preferences and optional requirements.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["York University", "University of Toronto", "York University"], "authors": ["Sotirios Liaskos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liaskos:Sotirios", "Sheila A.
