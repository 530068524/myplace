In this paper, we propose a novel technique for state-space exploration of software that maintains an ongoing interaction with its environment. Our technique uses a combination of symbolic and concrete execution to build an abstract model of the analyzed application, in the form of a finite-state automaton, and uses the model to guide further state-space exploration. Through exploration, MACE further refines the abstract model. Using the abstract model as a scaffold, our technique wields more control over the search process. In particular: (1) shifting search to different parts of the search-space becomes easier, resulting in higher code coverage, and (2) the search is less likely to get stuck in small local state-subspaces (e.g., loops) irrelevant to the application's interaction with the environment. Preliminary experimental results show significant increases in the code coverage and exploration depth. Further, our approach found a number of new deep vulnerabilities.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Chia Yuan Cho.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cho:Chia_Yuan", "Domagoj Babic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babic:Domagoj", "Pongsin Poosankam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poosankam:Pongsin", "Kevin Zhijie Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Kevin_Zhijie", "Edward XueJun Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Edward_XueJun", "Dawn Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Dawn"], "pages": -1}
