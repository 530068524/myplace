To explore how to facilitate such collaborations, a field-based participant observation study, as well as structured and unstructured interviews, were conducted at a home for children with severe disabilities. Team-building collaborative design activities were pursued. Guidelines are proposed for how to collaborate with children with severe motor impairments.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Oregon"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Anthony J.
