Examples include question answering systems and dialogue systems, voice search on mobile devices and entity search engines like Facebook's Graph Search or Google's Knowledge Graph. However the performance of textbook information retrieval techniques for such verbose queries is not as good as that for their shorter counterparts. Thus, effective handling of verbose queries has become a critical factor for adoption of information retrieval techniques in this new breed of search applications. Over the past decade, the information retrieval community has deeply explored the problem of transforming natural language verbose queries using operations like reduction, weighting, expansion, reformulation and segmentation into more effective structural representations. However, thus far, there was not a coherent and organized tutorial on this topic. In this tutorial, we aim to put together various research pieces of the puzzle, provide a comprehensive and structured overview of various proposed methods, and also list various application scenarios where effective verbose query processing can make a significant difference.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Google", "Microsoft", "Google"], "authors": ["Manish Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Manish", "Michael Bendersky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bendersky:Michael"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
