A reduction that is sound in this non-standard sense implies that it is NP-hard to distinguish whether an  n -vertex graph has an independent set of size ( 1\u00e2   1/\u00e2  2 )  n  \u00e2    o ( n ) or whether every independent set has size  o ( n ), and consequently, that it is NP-hard to approximate the Vertex Cover problem within a factor \u00e2  2\u00e2   o (1).", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["New York University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Subhash Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Subhash", "Dor Minzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minzer:Dor", "Muli Safra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Safra:Muli"], "pages": 14}
