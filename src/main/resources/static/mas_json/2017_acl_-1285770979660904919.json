{"title": "Abstract Syntax Networks for Code Generation and Semantic Parsing.", "fields": ["homoiconicity", "syntax error", "abstract semantic graph", "s attributed grammar", "bottom up parsing"], "abstract": "Tasks like code generation and semantic parsing require mapping unstructured (or partially structured) inputs to well-formed, executable outputs. We introduce abstract syntax networks, a modeling framework for these problems. The outputs are represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and constructed by a decoder with a dynamically-determined modular structure paralleling the structure of the output tree. On the benchmark Hearthstone dataset for code generation, our model obtains 79.2 BLEU and 22.7% exact match accuracy, compared to previous state-of-the-art values of 67.1 and 6.1%. Furthermore, we perform competitively on the Atis, Jobs, and Geo semantic parsing datasets with no task-specific engineering.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Maxim Rabinovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rabinovich:Maxim", "Mitchell Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Mitchell", "Dan Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Dan"], "pages": 11}
