In the present study, however, we demonstrate and report on the interaction of subjects with a real device: a pinball machine. Results of this study clearly show that fast and well-timed control well beyond chance level is possible, even though the environment is extremely rich and requires precisely timed and complex predictive behavior. Using machine learning methods for mental state decoding, BCI-based pinball control is possible within the first session without the necessity to employ lengthy subject training. The current study shows clearly that very compelling control with excellent timing and dynamics is possible for a non-invasive BCI.", "citation": "Citations (125)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Machine Learnin ... erlin, Germany", "Machine Learnin ... erlin, Germany", "Machine Learnin ... erlin, Germany", "Machine Learnin ... erlin, Germany", "Machine Learnin ... erlin, Germany"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Michael Tangermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tangermann:Michael", "Matthias Krauledat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krauledat:Matthias", "Konrad Grzeska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grzeska:Konrad", "Max Sagebaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sagebaum:Max", "Benjamin Blankertz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blankertz:Benjamin", "Carmen Vidaurre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidaurre:Carmen", "Klaus-Robert M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller:Klaus=Robert"], "pages": 8}
