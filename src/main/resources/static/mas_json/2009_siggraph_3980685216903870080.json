Services, such as Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's EC2, allow users to instantiate virtual machines (VMs) on demand and thus purchase precisely the capacity they require when they require it. In turn, the use of virtualization allows third-party cloud providers to maximize the utilization of their sunk capital costs by multiplexing many customer VMs across a shared physical infrastructure. However, in this paper, we show that this approach can also introduce new vulnerabilities. Using the Amazon EC2 service as a case study, we show that it is possible to map the internal cloud infrastructure, identify where a particular target VM is likely to reside, and then instantiate new VMs until one is placed co-resident with the target. We explore how such placement can then be used to mount cross-VM side-channel attacks to extract information from a target VM on the same machine.", "citation": "Citations (2,045)", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "North Carolina State University", "Hewlett-Packard", "University of California, Davis", "University of Guelph", "University of Guelph", "University of Guelph", "University of W\u00fcrzburg", "University of W\u00fcrzburg", "University College London", "University College London", "University College London", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "Barlow Lyde & Gilbert LLP, UK", "Barlow Lyde & Gilbert LLP, UK", "Barlow Lyde & Gilbert LLP, UK"], "authors": ["Guy Ben Shetrit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shetrit:Guy_Ben"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2009", "pages": 1}
