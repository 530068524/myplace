{"title": "Jenga: Software-Defined Cache Hierarchies.", "fields": ["distributed cache", "cache algorithms", "cache", "working set", "cache pollution"], "abstract": "Caches are traditionally organized as a rigid hierarchy, with multiple levels of progressively larger and slower memories. Hierarchy allows a simple, fixed design to benefit a wide range of applications, since working sets settle at the smallest (i.e., fastest and most energy-efficient) level they fit in. However, rigid hierarchies also add overheads, because each level adds latency and energy even when it does not fit the working set. These overheads are expensive on emerging systems with heterogeneous memories, where the differences in latency and energy across levels are small. Significant gains are possible by specializing the hierarchy to applications.   We propose Jenga, a reconfigurable cache hierarchy that dynamically and transparently specializes itself to applications. Jenga builds virtual cache hierarchies out of heterogeneous, distributed cache banks using simple hardware mechanisms and an OS runtime. In contrast to prior techniques that trade energy and bandwidth for performance (e.g., dynamic bypassing or prefetching), Jenga eliminates accesses to unwanted cache levels. Jenga thus improves both performance and energy efficiency. On a 36-core chip with a 1 GB DRAM cache, Jenga improves energy-delay product over a combination of state-of-the-art techniques by 23% on average and by up to 85%.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Po-An Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Po=An", "Nathan Beckmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beckmann:Nathan", "Daniel S\u00e1nchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=aacute=nchez_0003:Daniel"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2017", "pages": 14}
