In this paper, we present the first adaptive indexing mechanism, specifically tailored to solve the problem of indexing and querying very large data series collections. The main idea is that instead of building the complete index over the complete data set up-front and querying only later, we interactively and adaptively build parts of the index, only for the parts of the data on which the users pose queries. The net effect is that instead of waiting for extended periods of time for the index creation, users can immediately start exploring the data series. We present a detailed design and evaluation of adaptive data series indexing over both synthetic data and real-world workloads. The results show that our approach can gracefully handle large data series collections, while drastically reducing the data to query delay: by the time state-of-the-art indexing techniques finish indexing 1 billion data series (and before answering even a single query), adaptive data series indexing has already answered $3*10^5$ queries.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Trento", "Harvard University", "Paris Descartes University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kostas Zoumpatianos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zoumpatianos:Kostas", "Stratos Idreos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Idreos:Stratos", "Themis Palpanas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palpanas:Themis"], "pages": 12}
