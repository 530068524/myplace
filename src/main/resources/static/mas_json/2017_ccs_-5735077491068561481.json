The question we ask is, what property X of  h  guarantees collision resistance (CR) of  H ? The classical answer is that X itself be CR. We show that weaker conditions X, in particular forms of what we call constrained-CR, suffice. This reduces demands on compression functions, to the benefit of security, and also, forensically, explains why collision-finding attacks on compression functions have not, historically, lead to immediate breaks of the corresponding hash functions. We obtain our results via a definitional framework called RS security, and a parameterized treatment of MD, that also serve to unify prior work and variants of the transform.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Joseph Jaeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaeger:Joseph", "Julia Len.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Len:Julia"], "pages": 16}
