This paper presents the design and implementation of three key features of Futhark that seek a suitable middle ground with imperative approaches.     First, in order to express efficient code inside the parallel constructs, we introduce a simple type system for in-place updates that ensures referential transparency and supports equational reasoning.     Second, we furnish Futhark with parallel operators capable of expressing efficient strength-reduced code, along with their fusion rules.     Third, we present a flattening transformation aimed at enhancing the degree of parallelism that (i) builds on loop interchange and distribution but uses higher-order reasoning rather than array-dependence analysis, and (ii) still allows further locality-of-reference optimisations. Finally, an evaluation on 16 benchmarks demonstrates the impact of the language and compiler features and shows application-level performance competitive with hand-written GPU code.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "authors": ["Troels Henriksen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henriksen:Troels", "Niels G.
