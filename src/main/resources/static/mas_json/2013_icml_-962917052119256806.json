The algorithm is shown to be near-optimal for all but O(N log2 N) timesteps with high probability. Infinite classes are also considered where we show that compactness is a key criterion for determining the existence of uniform sample-complexity bounds. A matching lower bound is given for the finite case.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Tor Lattimore.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lattimore:Tor", "Marcus Hutter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hutter:Marcus", "Peter Sunehag.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sunehag:Peter"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
