In this demonstration, we illustrate a simple workflow enabling users to design secure executions of their queries. The Data Storm system demonstrated simplifies both the design and execution of encrypted execution plans, and represents progress toward the challenge of developing a general planner for encrypted query execution.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation", "Mitre Corporation"], "authors": ["Kenneth P.
