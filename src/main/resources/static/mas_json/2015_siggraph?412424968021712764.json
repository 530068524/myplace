{"title": "Fully automatic ID mattes with support for motion blur and transparency.", "fields": ["rendering", "computer graphics images", "transparency", "motion blur", "bitmap"], "abstract": "In 3D production for commercials, television, and film, ID mattes are commonly used to modify rendered images without re-rendering. ID mattes are bitmap images used to isolate specific objects, or multiple objects, such as all of the buttons on a shirt. Many 3D pipelines are built to provide compositors with ID mattes in addition to beauty renders to allow flexibility.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Psychological Operations", "Psychological Operations"], "authors": ["Jonah Friedman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Friedman:Jonah", "Andrew C.
