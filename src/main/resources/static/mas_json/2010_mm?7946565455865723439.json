We first investigate a few hypotheses concerning social attention and characterize meetings and individuals based on ground-truth data. This is followed by replication of ground-truth results through automated estimation of eye-gaze, head-pose and speech activity for each participant. Experimental results show that combining eye-gaze and head-pose estimates decreases error in social attention estimation by over 26%.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento", "University of Trento", "Foundazione Bru ... , Trento, Italy", "Foundazione Bru ... , Trento, Italy"], "authors": ["Subramanian Ramanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanathan:Subramanian", "Jacopo Staiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Staiano:Jacopo", "Kyriaki Kalimeri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalimeri:Kyriaki", "Nicu Sebe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebe:Nicu", "Fabio Pianesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pianesi:Fabio"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
