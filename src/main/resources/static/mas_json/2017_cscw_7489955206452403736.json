{"title": "Call for Service: Characterizing and Modeling Police Response to Serviceable Requests on Facebook.", "fields": ["public relations", "social media", "harassment", "psychological intervention", "traffic congestion"], "abstract": "Social media platforms have obtained substantial interest of police to connect with residents. This has encouraged residents to report day-to-day law and order concerns such as traffic congestion, missing people, and harassment by cops on these platforms. In this paper, we study day-to-day concerns shared by residents on social media and police response to such concerns. Based on the input of police experts, we define concerns that require police response and attention, as a serviceable request. We provide insights on six textual attributes that can identify serviceable posts. We find such posts are marked by high negative emotions, more factual, and objective content such as location and time of incidences. We show that police response time varies depending upon the kind of serviceable requests. Our work explores a series of statistical models to predict serviceable posts and its different types. We conclude the paper, discussing the implication of our findings on police practices and design needs for possible technological interventions. These technological interventions will help increase the interactions between police and residents and thereby increasing the well-being and safety of society.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology", "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology"], "authors": ["Niharika Sachdeva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sachdeva:Niharika", "Ponnurangam Kumaraguru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumaraguru:Ponnurangam"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 17}
