We construct a Canonical Tester for the class of symmetric properties of one or two distributions, satisfying a certain weak continuity condition. Analyzing the performance of the Canonical Tester on specific properties resolves several open problems, establishing lower bounds that match known upper bounds: we show that distinguishing between entropy  \u03b2 on distributions over [n] requires n \u03b1/\u03b2- o(1)  samples, and distinguishing whether a pair of distributions has statistical distance  \u03b2 requires n 1-o(1)  samples. Our techniques also resolve a conjecture about a property that our Canonical Tester does not apply to: distinguishing identical distributions from those with statistical distance >\u03b2 requires \u03a9(n 2/3 ) samples.", "citation": "Citations (97)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "pvaliant@gmail.com"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Paul Valiant.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valiant:Paul"], "pages": 10}
