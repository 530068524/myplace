{"title": "Exponential separations in the energy complexity of leader election.", "fields": ["network packet", "collision detection", "leader election", "binary logarithm", "exponential function"], "abstract": "Energy  is often the most constrained resource for battery-powered wireless devices and the lion\u00e2  s share of energy is often spent on transceiver usage (sending/receiving packets), not on computation. In this paper we study the  energy complexity  of Leader Election and Approximate Counting in several models of wireless radio networks. It turns out that energy complexity is very sensitive to whether the devices can generate random bits and their ability to  detect collisions . We consider four collision-detection models: Strong-CD (in which transmitters and listeners detect collisions), Sender-CD and Receiver-CD (in which only transmitters or only listeners detect collisions), and No-CD (in which no one detects collisions.)   The take-away message of our results is quite surprising. For randomized Leader Election algorithms, there is an exponential gap between the energy complexity of Sender-CD and Receiver-CD:   No-CD = Sender-CD \u00e2 \ufffd Receiver-CD = Strong-CD   and for deterministic Leader Election algorithms, there is another exponential gap in energy complexity,  but in the reverse direction :   No-CD = Receiver-CD \u00e2 \ufffd Sender-CD = Strong-CD   In particular, the randomized energy complexity of Leader Election is I (log *   n ) in Sender-CD but I (log(log *   n )) in Receiver-CD, where  n  is the (unknown) number of devices. Its deterministic complexity is I (log N ) in Receiver-CD but I (loglog N ) in Sender-CD, where  N  is the (known) size of the devices\u00e2   ID space.   There is a tradeoff between time and energy. We give a new upper bound on the time-energy tradeoff curve for randomized Leader Election and Approximate Counting. A critical component of this algorithm is a new deterministic Leader Election algorithm for  dense  instances, when  n =I ( N ), with inverse-Ackermann-type ( O (I\ufffd( N ))) energy complexity.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yi-Jun Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yi=Jun", "Tsvi Kopelowitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kopelowitz:Tsvi", "Seth Pettie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pettie:Seth", "Ruosong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ruosong", "Wei Zhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhan:Wei"], "pages": 13}
