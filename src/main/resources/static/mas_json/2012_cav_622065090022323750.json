Key to this setting is a novel construction for translating properties from LTL to very-weak automata, whenever possible. Such automata are structurally simple and thus amenable to optimizations as well as symbolic implementations.\n\nBased on this novel construction, we describe a synthesis approach that inherits the efficiency of generalized reactivity(1) synthesis [27], but is significantly richer in terms of expressivity.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Saarland University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["R\u00fcdiger Ehlers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ehlers:R=uuml=diger"], "pages": 16}
