{"title": "Skip-and-prune: cosine-based top-k query processing for efficient context-sensitive document retrieval.", "fields": ["document retrieval", "ranking", "query expansion", "data access", "view"], "abstract": "Keyword search and ranked retrieval together emerged as popular data access paradigms for various kinds of data, from web pages to XML and relational databases. A user can submit keywords without knowing much (sometimes nothing) about the complex structure underlying a data collection, yet the system can identify, rank, and return a set of relevant matches by exploiting statistics about the distribution and structure of the data. Keyword-based data models are also suitable for capturing user's search context in terms of weights associated to the keywords in the query. Given a search context, the data in the database can also be re-interpreted for semantically correct retrieval. This option, however, is often ignored as the cost of re-assessing the content in the database naively tends to be prohibitive. In this paper, we first argue that top- k  query processing can help tackle this challenge by re-assessing only the relevant parts of the database, efficiently. A road-block in this process, however, is that most efficient implementations of top- k  query processing assume that the scoring function is monotonic, whereas the cosine-based scoring function needed for re-interpretation of content based on user context is not. In this paper, we develop an efficient top- k  query processing algorithm,  skip-and-prune (SnP) , which is able to process top- k  queries under  cosine-based  non-monotonic scoring functions. We compare the use of proposed algorithm against the alternative implementations of the context-aware retrieval, including naive top- k ,  accumulator -based inverted files, and full-scan. The experiment results show that while being fast, naive top- k  is not an effective solution due to the non-monotonicity of underlying scoring function. The proposed technique,  SnP , however, matches the precision of  accumulator -based inverted files and full-scan, yet it is orders of magnitude faster than these.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jong Wook Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jong_Wook", "K.
