{"title": "Learning and Selecting Features Jointly with Point-wise Gated Boltzmann Machines.", "fields": ["boltzmann machine", "feature learning", "feature", "generative model"], "abstract": "Unsupervised feature learning has emerged as a promising tool in learning representations from unlabeled data. However, it is still challenging to learn useful high-level features when the data contains a significant amount of irrelevant patterns. Although feature selection can be used for such complex data, it may fail when we have to build a learning system from scratch (i.e., starting from the lack of useful raw features). To address this problem, we propose a point-wise gated Boltzmann machine, a unified generative model that combines feature learning and feature selection. Our model performs not only feature selection on learned high-level features (i.e., hidden units), but also dynamic feature selection on raw features (i.e., visible units) through a gating mechanism. For each example, the model can adaptively focus on a variable subset of visible nodes corresponding to the task-relevant patterns, while ignoring the visible units corresponding to the task-irrelevant patterns. In experiments, our method achieves improved performance over state-of-the-art in several visual recognition benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Kihyuk Sohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sohn:Kihyuk", "Guanyu Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guanyu", "Chansoo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Chansoo", "Honglak Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Honglak"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
