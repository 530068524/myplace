{"title": "A 2^70 Attack on the Full MISTY1.", "fields": ["affine space", "linear cryptanalysis", "misty1", "block cipher", "cipher"], "abstract": "MISTY1 is a block cipher designed by Matsui in 1997. It is widely deployed in Japan, and is recognized internationally as a European NESSIE-recommended cipher and an ISO standard. After almost 20i\u00be?years of unsuccessful cryptanalytic attempts, a first attack on the full MISTY1 was presented at CRYPTO 2015 by Yosuke Todo. The attack, using a new technique called division property, requires almost the full codebook and has time complexity of $$2^{107.3}$$ encryptions.\n\nIn this paper we present a new attack on the full MISTY1. It is based on Todo's division property, along with a variety of refined key-recovery techniques. Our attack requires almost the full codebook like Todo's attack, but allows to retrieve 49 bits of the secret key in time complexity of only $$2^{64}$$ encryptions, and the full key in time complexity of $$2^{69.5}$$ encryptions.\n\nWhile our attack is clearly impractical due to its large data complexity, it shows that MISTY1 provides security of only $$2^{70}$$ -- significantly less than what was considered before.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Bar-Ilan University"], "authors": ["Achiya Bar-On.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bar=On:Achiya", "Nathan Keller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keller:Nathan"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2016", "pages": 22}
