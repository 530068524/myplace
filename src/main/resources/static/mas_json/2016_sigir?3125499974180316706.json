{"title": "A Comparison of Cache Blocking Methods for Fast Execution of Ensemble-based Score Computation.", "fields": ["cache algorithms", "memory hierarchy", "cache coloring", "cache oblivious algorithm", "loop nest optimization"], "abstract": "Machine-learned classification and ranking techniques often use ensembles to aggregate partial scores of feature vectors for high accuracy and the runtime score computation can become expensive when employing a large number of ensembles. The previous work has shown the judicious use of memory hierarchy in a modern CPU architecture which can effectively shorten the time of score computation. However, different traversal methods and blocking parameter settings can exhibit different cache and cost behavior depending on data and architectural characteristics. It is very time-consuming to conduct exhaustive search for performance comparison and optimum selection. This paper provides an analytic comparison of cache blocking methods on their data access performance with an approximation and proposes a fast guided sampling scheme to select a traversal method and blocking parameters for effective use of memory hierarchy. The evaluation studies with three datasets show that within a reasonable amount of time, the proposed scheme can identify a highly competitive solution that significantly accelerates score calculation.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Xin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xin", "Tao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0009:Tao", "Xun Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xun"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
