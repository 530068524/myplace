We frame the problem as inference in a Markov Random Field, in which each detection hypothesis scores object appearance as well as contextual information using Convolutional Neural Networks, and allows the hypothesis to choose and score a segment out of a large pool of accurate object segmentation proposals. This enables the detector to incorporate additional evidence when it is available and thus results in more accurate detections. Our experiments show an improvement of 4.1% in mAP over the R-CNN baseline on PASCAL VOC 2010, and 3.4% over the current state-of-the-art, demonstrating the power of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yukun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yukun", "Raquel Urtasun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urtasun:Raquel", "Ruslan Salakhutdinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salakhutdinov:Ruslan", "Sanja Fidler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fidler:Sanja"], "pages": 9}
