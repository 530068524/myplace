{"title": "Standing on the schemas of giants: socially augmented information foraging.", "fields": ["knowledge management", "social search", "foraging", "information foraging", "schema"], "abstract": "People spend an enormous amount of time searching for complex information online; for example, consumers researching new purchases or patients learning about their conditions. As they search, people build up rich mental schemas about their target domains; which, if effectively shared, could accelerate learning for others with similar interests. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for integrating the schemas individuals develop as they gather information online and surfacing them for others with similar interests. Through a controlled experiment we show that having access to others' schemas while foraging for information helps new users to induce more useful, prototypical, and better-structured schemas than gathering information alone.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Aniket Kittur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kittur:Aniket", "Andrew M.
