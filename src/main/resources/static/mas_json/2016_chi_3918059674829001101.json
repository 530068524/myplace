We have developed a personal tracking application that enables users to automatically monitor their 'screen time' on mobile devices (iOS and Android) and computers (Mac and Windows). The application interface enables users to combine screen time data from multiple devices. We trialled the application for 28+ days with 21 users, collecting log data and interviewing each user. We found that there is interest in personal tracking in this area, but that the study participants were less interested in quantifying their overall screen time than in gaining data about their use of specific devices and applications. We found that personal tracking of device use is desirable for goals including: increasing productivity, disciplining device use, and cutting down on use.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["John Rooksby.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rooksby:John", "Parvin Asadzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asadzadeh:Parvin", "Mattias Rost.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rost:Mattias", "Alistair Morrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morrison:Alistair", "Matthew Chalmers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chalmers:Matthew"], "pages": 13}
