The model is learned from a word-aligned bilingual corpus where the collocated words in source sentences are automatically detected. During decoding, the model is employed to softly constrain the translation orders of the source language collocations, so as to constrain the translation orders of those source phrases containing these collocated words. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the translation quality, achieving the absolute improvements of 1.1~1.4 BLEU score over the baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Baidu", "Baidu", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zhanyi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Zhanyi", "Haifeng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Haifeng", "Hua Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0003:Hua", "Ting Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Ting", "Sheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0003:Sheng"], "pages": 9}
