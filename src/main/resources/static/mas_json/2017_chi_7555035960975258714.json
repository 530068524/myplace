Although blind people can label appliances with Braille stickers, doing so generally requires sighted assistance to identify the original functions and apply the labels. We introduce  Facade  - a crowdsourced fabrication pipeline to help blind people independently make physical interfaces accessible by adding a 3D printed augmentation of tactile buttons overlaying the original panel. Facade users capture a photo of the appliance with a readily available fiducial marker (a dollar bill) for recovering size information. This image is sent to multiple crowd workers, who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface. Facade then generates a 3D model for a layer of tactile and pressable buttons that fits over the original controls. Finally, a home 3D printer or commercial service fabricates the layer, which is then aligned and attached to the interface by the blind person. We demonstrate the viability of Facade in a study with 11 blind participants.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Colorado Boulder", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Anhong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Anhong", "Jeeeun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Jeeeun", "Xiang 'Anthony' Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Xiang_=Anthony=", "Tom Yeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeh:Tom", "Scott E.
