The framework is based on active learning algorithms that are statistical in the sense that they rely on estimates of expectations of functions of filtered random examples. It builds on the powerful statistical query framework of Kearns [30].\n\nWe show that any efficient active statistical learning algorithm can be automatically converted to an efficient active learning algorithm which is tolerant to random classification noise as well as other forms of \"uncorrelated\" noise. We show that commonly studied concept classes including thresholds, rectangles, and linear separators can be efficiently actively learned in our framework. These results combined with our generic conversion lead to the first computationally-efficient algorithms for actively learning some of these concept classes in the presence of random classification noise that provide exponential improvement in the dependence on the error \u2208 over their passive counterparts. In addition, we show that our algorithms can be automatically converted to efficient active differentially-private algorithms. This leads to the first differentially-private active learning algorithms with exponential label savings over the passive case.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "IBM"], "authors": ["Maria-Florina Balcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balcan:Maria=Florina", "Vitaly Feldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldman:Vitaly"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
