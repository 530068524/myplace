{"title": "The dual-sparse topic model: mining focused topics and focused terms in short text.", "fields": ["effective method", "word usage", "topic model", "web content", "user generated content"], "abstract": "Topic modeling has been proved to be an effective method for exploratory text mining. It is a common assumption of most topic models that a document is generated from a mixture of topics. In real-world scenarios, individual documents usually concentrate on several salient topics instead of covering a wide variety of topics. A real topic also adopts a narrow range of terms instead of a wide coverage of the vocabulary. Understanding this sparsity of information is especially important for analyzing user-generated Web content and social media, which are featured as extremely short posts and condensed discussions. In this paper, we propose a dual-sparse topic model that addresses the sparsity in both the topic mixtures and the word usage. By applying a \"Spike and Slab\" prior to decouple the sparsity and smoothness of the document-topic and topic-word distributions, we allow individual documents to select a few focused topics and a topic to select focused terms, respectively. Experiments on different genres of large corpora demonstrate that the dual-sparse topic model outperforms both classical topic models and existing sparsity-enhanced topic models. This improvement is especially notable on collections of short documents.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of Michigan", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Tianyi Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Tianyi", "Wentao Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Wentao", "Qiaozhu Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Qiaozhu", "Hong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Hong"], "conf": "www", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
