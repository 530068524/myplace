Elizabeth Hoffman et al. ( hereafter, HMS ) ( 1996 ) have provided an insightful analysis of why experimental results deviate from game theoretic predictions in dictator games. The authors conclude that individuals\u2019 dispositional knowledge about social norms and reciprocity is activated by decreasing social distance even though the dictator game explicitly excludes reciprocal sanctioning possibilities by experimental design. We challenge this conclusion. While HMS (p. 654) define social distance to be \u2018\u2018the degree of reciprocity that subjects believe exist within a social interaction,\u2019\u2019 we argue that social distance influences otherregardedness independent of any norms of social exchange. When social distance decreases, the \u2018\u2018other\u2019\u2019 is no longer some unknown individual from some anonymous crowd but becomes an \u2018\u2018identifiable victim\u2019\u2019 (Thomas C. Schelling 1968). In order to discriminate between reciprocity-based and identifiabilitybased other-regardedness, we also used the dictator game and varied the degree of social distance.
