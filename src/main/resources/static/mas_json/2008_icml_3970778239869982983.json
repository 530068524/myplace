Our analysis helps compare the stability of these algorithms. It suggests that several existing algorithms might not be stable but prescribes a technique to make them stable. It also reports the results of experiments with local transductive regression demonstrating the benefit of our stability bounds for model selection, in particular for determining the radius of the local neighborhood used by the algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Google", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Corinna Cortes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cortes:Corinna", "Mehryar Mohri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohri:Mehryar", "Dmitry Pechyony.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pechyony:Dmitry", "Ashish Rastogi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rastogi:Ashish"], "pages": 8}
