{"title": "LightNVM: The Linux Open-Channel SSD Subsystem.", "fields": ["latency", "real time computing", "stack", "disk array", "parallel computing"], "abstract": "As Solid-State Drives (SSDs) become commonplace in data-centers and storage arrays, there is a growing demand for predictable latency. Traditional SSDs, serving block I/Os, fail to meet this demand. They offer a high-level of abstraction at the cost of unpredictable performance and suboptimal resource utilization. We propose that SSD management trade-offs should be handled through Open-Channel SSDs, a new class of SSDs, that give hosts control over their internals. We present our experience building LightNVM, the Linux Open-Channel SSD subsystem. We introduce a new Physical Page Address I/O interface that exposes SSD parallelism and storage media characteristics. LightNVM integrates into traditional storage stacks, while also enabling storage engines to take advantage of the new I/O interface. Our experimental results demonstrate that LightNVM has modest host overhead, that it can be tuned to limit read latency variability and that it can be customized to achieve predictable I/O latencies.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["IT University of Copenhagen", "IT University of Copenhagen", "CNEX Labs, Inc."], "authors": ["Matias Bj\u00f8rling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bj=oslash=rling:Matias", "Javier Gonzalez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gonzalez:Javier", "Philippe Bonnet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonnet:Philippe"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2017", "pages": 16}
