In this paper, we deal with the opposite, namely, a problem we call correlation hiding (CH), which is fundamental in numerous applications that need to disseminate data containing sensitive information. In this problem, we are given a relational table T whose attributes can be classified into three disjoint sets A, B, and C. The objective is to distort some values in T so that A becomes independent from B, and yet, their correlation with C is preserved as much as possible. CH is different from all the problems studied previously in the area of data privacy, in that CH demands complete elimination of the correlation between two sets of attributes, whereas the previous research focuses on partial elimination up to a certain level. A new operator called independence masking is proposed to solve the CH problem. Implementations of the operator with good worst case guarantees are described in the full version of this short note.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Simon Fraser University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Nanyang Technological University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei", "Jian Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Jian", "Jiexing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiexing", "Xiaokui Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Xiaokui", "Ke Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Ke", "Zhengzheng Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Zhengzheng"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
