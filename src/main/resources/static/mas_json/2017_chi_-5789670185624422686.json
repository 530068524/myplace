{"title": "Supporting Easy Physical-to-Virtual Creation of Mobile VR Maze Games: A New Genre.", "fields": ["game mechanics", "game design", "video game development", "game developer", "game art design"], "abstract": "With the fast development of virtual reality games, one of the key research questions is how players may express their creativity and participate in the process of game design. In this paper, we present a new game genre which combines user-controlled game design in physical space with game play in virtual space on a mobile device. The new system supports authoring by anyone, creating virtual reality games that can be easily modified or developed for physical space, and be used anywhere by novice end-users without any knowledge of tracking technology. We present the design and implementation of the system, as well as a user experiment. Findings illustrate that the proposed system promotes participation and provides a richer, more interactive and engaging experience.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Shandong University", "National Science Foundation", "Shandong University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Wei Gai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gai:Wei", "Chenglei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Chenglei", "Yulong Bian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bian:Yulong", "Chia Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chia", "Xiangxu Meng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meng:Xiangxu", "Lu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0007:Lu", "Juan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Juan", "Mingda Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Mingda", "Chengjie Niu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niu:Chengjie", "Cheng Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Cheng"], "pages": 13}
