Recently, one specific SC technique, Group Sparse Coding (GSC), has been proposed to learn a common dictionary over multiple different groups of data, where the data groups are assumed to be pre-defined. In practice, this may not always be the case. In this paper, we propose Automatic Group Sparse Coding (AutoGSC), which can (1) discover the hidden data groups; (2) learn a common dictionary over different data groups; and (3) learn an individual dictionary for each data group. Finally, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real world data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoGSC, and compare it with traditional sparse coding and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) methods.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["IBM", "Columbia University", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "NTT Media Intel ...
