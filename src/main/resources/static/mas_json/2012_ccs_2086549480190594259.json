{"title": "Vigilare: toward snoop-based kernel integrity monitor.", "fields": ["kernel", "bus sniffing", "snapshot", "embedded system", "computer security"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present  Vigilare system , a kernel integrity monitor that is architected to snoop the bus traffic of the host system from a separate independent hardware. This  snoop-based monitoring  enabled by the Vigilare system, overcomes the limitations of the  snapshot-based monitoring  employed in previous kernel integrity monitoring solutions. Being based on inspecting snapshots collected over a certain interval, the previous hardware-based monitoring solutions cannot detect  transient attacks  that can occur in between snapshots. We implemented a prototype of the Vigilare system on Gaisler's grlib-based system-on-a-chip (SoC) by adding  Snooper  hardware connections module to the host system for bus snooping. To evaluate the benefit of snoop-based monitoring, we also implemented similar SoC with a snapshot-based monitor to be compared with. The Vigilare system detected all the transient attacks without performance degradation while the snapshot-based monitor could not detect all the attacks and induced considerable performance degradation as much as 10% in our tuned STREAM benchmark test.", "citation": "Citations (76)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Seoul National University", "KAIST", "Seoul National University", "KAIST", "Seoul National University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Hyungon Moon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moon:Hyungon", "Hojoon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hojoon", "Jihoon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jihoon", "Kihwan Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kihwan", "Yunheung Paek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paek:Yunheung", "Brent ByungHoon Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Brent_ByungHoon"], "pages": 10}
