For complex models such as humans, previous work has required a good initialization, or an alternating minimization between correspondence and pose. In this paper we investigate one-shot pose estimation: can we directly infer correspondences using a regression function trained to be invariant to body size and shape, and then optimize the model pose just once? We evaluate on several challenging single-frame data sets containing a wide variety of body poses, shapes, torso rotations, and image cropping. Our experiments demonstrate that one-shot pose estimation achieves state of the art results and runs in real-time.", "citation": "Citations (227)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jonathan Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor:Jonathan", "Jamie Shotton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shotton:Jamie", "Toby Sharp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharp:Toby", "Andrew W.
