In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.", "citation": "Citations (1,315)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Tianqi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Tianqi", "Carlos Guestrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guestrin:Carlos"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
