{"title": "Testing Closeness With Unequal Sized Samples.", "fields": ["oracle", "binary logarithm", "natural language", "closeness", "statistic"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of testing whether two unequal-sized samples were drawn from identical distributions, versus distributions that differ significantly. Specifically, given a target error parameter e > 0, m1 independent draws from an unknown distribution p with discrete support, and m2 draws from an unknown distribution q of discrete support, we describe a test for distinguishing the case that p = q from the case that \u2016p - q\u20161 \u2265 e. If p and q are supported on at most n elements, then our test is successful with high probability provided m1 \u2265 n2/3/e4/3 and m2 = \u03a9 (max{n/\u221am1 e2, \u221an/e2}). We show that this tradeoff is information theoretically optimal throughout this range in the dependencies on all parameters, n, m1, and e, to constant factors for worst-case distributions. As a consequence, we obtain an algorithm for estimating the mixing time of a Markov chain on n states up to a log n factor that uses O(n3/2\u03c4mix) queries to a \"next node\" oracle. The core of our testing algorithm is a relatively simple statistic that seems to perform well in practice, both on synthetic and on natural language data. We believe that this statistic might prove to be a useful primitive within larger machine learning and natural language processing systems.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Bhaswar B.
