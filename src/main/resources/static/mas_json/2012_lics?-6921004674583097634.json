In this paper, we show how this theorem can be internalized. More precisely, we describe an extension of the Pure Type Systems with a special parametricity rule (with computational content), and prove fundamental properties such as Church-Rosser's and strong normalization. All instances of the abstraction theorem can be both expressed and proved in the calculus itself. Moreover, one can apply parametricity to the parametricity rule: parametricity is itself parametric.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Gothenburg", "University of Gothenburg"], "authors": ["Jean-Philippe Bernardy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bernardy:Jean=Philippe", "Guilhem Moulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moulin:Guilhem"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
