Although far from complete, extracting meaningful patterns from proteomic networks is a non-trivial task due to their size-complexity. This paper proposes a computational framework to efficiently discover topologically-similar patterns from large proteomic networks using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). PSO is a robust and low-cost optimization technique that demonstrated to work effectively on the complex, mostly sparse proteomic networks. The resulting topologically-similar patterns of close proximity are utilized to systematically predict new high-confidence protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The proposed PSO-based PPI prediction method (3PI) managed to predict high-confidence PPIs, validated by more than one computational/experimental source, through a proposed PPI knowledge transfer process between topologically-similar interaction patterns of close proximity. In three case studies, over 50% of the predicted interactions for EFGR, ERBB2, ERBB3, GRB2 and UBC are overlapped with publically available interaction databases, \u223c80% of the predictions are found among the Top 1% results of another PPI prediction method and their genes are significantly co-expressed across different tissues. Moreover, the only single prediction example that did not overlap with any of our validation sources was recently experimentally supported by two PubMed publications.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Queen's University", "Queen's University"], "authors": ["Hazem Radwan Ahmed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmed:Hazem_Radwan", "Janice I.
