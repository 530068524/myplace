First, an image up-sampling scheme is proposed which takes the advantages of both bilateral filtering and mean shift image segmentation. Then we use a shock filter to enhance strong edges in the initial up-sampling result and obtain an intermediate high-resolution image. Finally, we enforce a reconstruction constraint on the high-resolution image so that fine details can be inferred by back projection. Since strong edges in the intermediate result are enhanced, ringing artifacts can be suppressed in the back projection step. We compare our algorithm with several state-of-the-art image super-resolution algorithms. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs the best.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Qiang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Qiang", "Shifeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shifeng", "Jianzhuang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jianzhuang", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
