{"title": "Quantum one-way communication can be exponentially stronger than classical communication.", "fields": ["qubit", "quantum capacity", "quantum network", "quantum complexity theory", "quantum teleportation"], "abstract": "In STOC 1999, Raz presented a (partial) function for which there is a quantum protocol communicating only O(log n) qubits, but for which any classical (randomized, bounded-error) protocol requires poly(n) bits of communication. That quantum protocol requires two rounds of communication. Ever since Raz's paper it was open whether the same exponential separation can be achieved with a quantum protocol that uses only one round of communication. Here we settle this question in the affirmative.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Oded Regev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regev_0001:Oded", "Bo'az Klartag.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klartag:Bo=az"], "pages": 10}
