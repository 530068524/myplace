In this environment,ignoring variation effects whenscheduling applications or when managing power withDynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is suboptimal.                                                     This paper proposes variation-aware algorithms for applicationscheduling and power management. One such power managementalgorithm, called {\\em LinOpt}, uses linear programmingto find the best voltage and frequency levels for each of thecores in the CMP --- maximizing throughput at a given power budget.In a 20-core CMP, the combination of variation-awareapplication scheduling and {\\em LinOpt} increases the averagethroughput by 12--17\\% and reduces the average $ED^2$ by 30--38\\%--- all relative to using variation-awarescheduling together with a simple extension to Intel's Foxtonpower management algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (339)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Radu Teodorescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Teodorescu:Radu", "Josep Torrellas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torrellas:Josep"], "conf": "isca", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
