Protein structure is strongly related to protein function, thus structure prediction is a crucial task on the way to solve many biological questions. A contact map is a compact representation of the three-dimensional structure of a protein via the pairwise contacts between the amino acid constituting the protein. We use a convolutional network to calculate protein contact maps from inferred statistical coupling between positions in the protein sequence. The input to the network has an image-like structure amenable to convolutions, but every \"pixel\" instead of color channels contains a bipartite undirected edge-weighted graph. We propose several methods for treating such \"graph-valued images\" in a convolutional network. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. It also allows for a great flexibility with regard to the input data, which makes it useful for studying a wide range of problems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Aalto University", "Augsburg College", "University of Freiburg", "University of Freiburg"], "authors": ["Vladimir Golkov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Golkov:Vladimir", "Marcin J.
