Yet in busy and noisy environments, or when the user is physically active, these channels sometimes fail. Recent work has explored the use of physical shape-change as an additional method for conveying notifications when the device is in-hand or viewable. However, we do not yet understand the effectiveness of physical shape-change as a method for communicating in-pocket notifications. This paper presents three robustly implemented, mobile-device sized shape-changing devices, and two user studies to evaluate their effectiveness at conveying notifications. The studies reveal that (1) different types and configurations of shape-change convey different levels of urgency and; (2) fast pulsing shape-changing notifications are missed less often and recognised more quickly than the standard slower vibration pulse rates of a mobile device.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Panteleimon Dimitriadis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dimitriadis:Panteleimon", "Jason Alexander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alexander:Jason"], "pages": 4}
