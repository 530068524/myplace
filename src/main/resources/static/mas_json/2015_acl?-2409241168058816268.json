{"title": "Training a Natural Language Generator From Unaligned Data.", "fields": ["fluent", "perceptron", "planner", "natural language generation", "sentence"], "abstract": "We present a novel syntax-based natural language generation system that is trainable from unaligned pairs of input meaning representations and output sentences. It is divided into sentence planning, which incrementally builds deep-syntactic dependency trees, and surface realization. Sentence planner is based on A* search with a perceptron ranker that uses novel differing subtree updates and a simple future promise estimation; surface realization uses a rule-based pipeline from the Treex NLP toolkit. Our first results show that training from unaligned data is feasible, the outputs of our generator are mostly fluent and relevant.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Charles University in Prague", "Charles University in Prague"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ondrej Dusek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dusek:Ondrej", "Filip Jurc\u00edcek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jurc=iacute=cek:Filip"], "pages": 11}
