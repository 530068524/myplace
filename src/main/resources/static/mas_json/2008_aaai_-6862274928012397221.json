The systems result from (i) varying the style of branching and (ii) enforcing dynamic restrictions on the decision heuristics. Considering DPLL both with and without clause learning, we present a relative efficiency hierarchy for refinements of DPLL resulting from combinations of decision heuristics (top-down restricted, justification restricted, and unrestricted heuristics) and branching styles (typical DPLL-style and ATPG-style branching). An an example, for DPLL without clause learning, we establish a strict hierarchy, with the ATPG-style, justification restricted branching variant as the weakest system.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Helsinki University of Technology", "Helsinki University of Technology"], "authors": ["Matti J\u00e4rvisalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=auml=rvisalo:Matti", "Tommi A.
