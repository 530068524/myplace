Using aggregate demographic statistics about the authors' geographic communities, we solve a multi-output regression problem between demographics and lexical frequencies. By imposing a composite e1,\u221e regularizer, we obtain structured sparsity, driving entire rows of coefficients to zero. We perform two regression studies. First, we use term frequencies to predict demographic attributes; our method identifies a compact set of words that are strongly associated with author demographics. Next, we conjoin demographic attributes into features, which we use to predict term frequencies. The composite regularizer identifies a small number of features, which correspond to communities of authors united by shared demographic and linguistic properties.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jacob Eisenstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eisenstein:Jacob", "Noah A.
