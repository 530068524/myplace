{"title": "Type-hover-swipe in 96 bytes: a motion sensing mechanical keyboard.", "fields": ["motion history images", "byte", "swipe", "proximity sensor", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "We present a new type of augmented mechanical keyboard, capable of sensing rich and expressive  motion gestures  performed both  on  and directly  above  the device. Our hardware comprises of low-resolution matrix of infrared (IR) proximity sensors interspersed between the keys of a regular mechanical keyboard. This results in coarse but high frame-rate motion data. We extend a machine learning algorithm, traditionally used for static classification only, to robustly support dynamic, temporal gestures. We propose the use of  motion signatures  a technique that utilizes pairs of motion history images and a random forest based classifier to robustly recognize a large set of motion gestures on and directly above the keyboard. Our technique achieves a mean per-frame classification accuracy of 75.6% in leave-one-subject-out and 89.9% in half-test/half-training cross-validation. We detail our hardware and gesture recognition algorithm, provide performance and accuracy numbers, and demonstrate a large set of gestures designed to be performed with our device. We conclude with qualitative feedback from users, discussion of limitations and areas for future work.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "ETH Zurich", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Stuart Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor:Stuart", "Cem Keskin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keskin:Cem", "Otmar Hilliges.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hilliges:Otmar", "Shahram Izadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Izadi:Shahram", "John Helmes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Helmes:John"], "pages": 10}
