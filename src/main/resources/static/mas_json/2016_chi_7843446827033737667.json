We propose to embed piezoresistive sensing elements into flexible 3D printed objects. These sensing elements are then utilized to recover rich and natural user interactions at runtime. Designing such objects is a challenging and hard problem if attempted manually for all but the simplest geometries and deformations. Our method simultaneously optimizes the internal routing of the sensing elements and computes a mapping from low-level sensor readings to user-specified outputs in order to minimize reconstruction error. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of the approach by designing and fabricating a set of flexible input devices. Our results indicate that the optimization-based design greatly outperforms manual routings in terms of reconstruction accuracy and thus interaction fidelity.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Disney Research", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "McGill University", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Moritz B\u00e4cher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=auml=cher:Moritz", "Benjamin Hepp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hepp:Benjamin", "Fabrizio Pece.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pece:Fabrizio", "Paul G.
