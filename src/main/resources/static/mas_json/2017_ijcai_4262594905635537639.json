Our mechanism is based on four simple premises: a) memories can be formed from word sequences by using convo- lutional networks; b) distance measurements can be taken at a neuronal level; c) a recursive soft- max function can be used for attention; d) extensive weight sharing can help profoundly. We achieve state-of-the-art results in the bAbI tasks, outper- forming Memory Networks and the Differentiable Neural Computer, both in terms of accuracy and stability (i.e. variance) of results.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Essex", "University of Ljubljana", "University of Essex", "University of Essex"], "authors": ["Spyridon Samothrakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samothrakis:Spyridon", "Tom Vodopivec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vodopivec:Tom", "Michael Fairbank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fairbank:Michael", "Maria Fasli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fasli:Maria"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
