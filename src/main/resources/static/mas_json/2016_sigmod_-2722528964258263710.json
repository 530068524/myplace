{"title": "Query Planning for Evaluating SPARQL Property Paths.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "spatial query", "sparql", "database", "information retrieval", "sargable", "web search query", "computer science"], "abstract": "The extension of SPARQL in version 1.1 with  property paths  offers a type of  regular path query  for RDF graph databases. Such queries are difficult to optimize and evaluate efficiently, however. We have embarked on a project, Waveguide, to build a cost-based optimizer for SPARQL queries with property paths. Waveguide builds a query plan--- which we call a  waveplan  (WP)--- which  guides  the query evaluation. There are numerous choices in the construction of a plan, and a number of optimization methods, so the space of plans for a query can be quite large. Execution costs of plans for the same query can vary by orders of magnitude. A WGP's costs can be estimated, which opens the way to cost-based optimization. We demonstrate that the plan space of Waveguide properly subsumes existing techniques and that the new plans it adds are relevant.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["York University", "York University", "York University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Nikolay Yakovets.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yakovets:Nikolay", "Parke Godfrey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Godfrey:Parke", "Jarek Gryz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gryz:Jarek"], "pages": 15}
