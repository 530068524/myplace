First, we formally define a consistency measure, and then using this definition, evaluate 19 feature selection measures from the literature. While only 5 of these were labeled as consistency measures by their original authors, by our definition, an additional 9 measures should be classified as consistency measures. To compare these 14 consistency measures in terms of sensitivity, we introduce the concept of quasi-linear compatibility order, and partially determine the order among the measures. Next, we propose a new fast algorithm for consistency-based feature selection. We ran experiments using eleven large datasets to compare the performance of our algorithm against INTERACT and LCC, the only two instances of consistency-based algorithms with potential real world application. Our algorithm shows vast improvement in time efficiency, while its performance in accuracy is comparable with that of INTERACT and LCC.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Hyogo", "University of Hyogo", "Panasonic"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Kilho Shin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shin:Kilho", "Danny Fernandes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fernandes:Danny", "Seiya Miyazaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miyazaki:Seiya"], "pages": 7}
