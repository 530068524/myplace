However, in-network aggregation usually brings an unavoidable security defect. Some malicious nodes may control a large percentage of the whole network data and compel the network misbehave in an arbitrary manner. Thus, locating the malicious nodes to prevent them from further disaster is a practical challenge for data aggregation schemes. Based on the grouping and localization techniques, we propose a novel integrated protocol to locate malicious nodes. The proposed protocol does not rely on any special hardware and requests only incomplete information of the network from the security schemes. We also conduct simulation study to evaluate the proposed protocol.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["XiaoHua Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:XiaoHua", "Qian Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Qian", "Jiannong Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Jiannong", "Peng-Jun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Peng=Jun", "Kui Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren_0001:Kui", "Yuanfang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yuanfang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
