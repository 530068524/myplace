{"title": "SIMD code generation for stencils on brick decompositions.", "fields": ["stencil", "simd", "optimizing compiler", "speedup", "xeon phi"], "abstract": "We present a stencil library and associated compiler code generation framework designed to maximize performance on higher-order stencil computations through the use of two main technologies: a fine-grained  brick  data layout designed to exploit the inherent multidimensional spatial locality endemic to stencil computations, and a  vector scatter  associative reordering transformation that reduces vector loads and alignment operations and exposes opportunities for the backend compiler to reduce computation. For a range of stencil computations, we compare the generated code expressed in the brick library to the standard tiled code. We attain up to a 7.2X speedup on the most complex stencils when running on an Intel Knights Landing (Xeon Phi) processor.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "Computational R ... search Division", "Computational R ... search Division", "Computational R ... search Division"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Tuowen Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Tuowen", "Mary W.
