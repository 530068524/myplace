However, video game spectating is also a popular activity, boosted by the rise of online video sites and major gaming tournaments. In this paper, we focus on the spectator, who is emerging as an important stakeholder in video games. Our study focuses on Starcraft, a popular real-time strategy game with millions of spectators and high level tournament play. We have collected over a hundred stories of the Starcraft spectator from online sources, aiming for as diverse a group as possible. We make three contributions using this data: i) we find nine personas in the data that tell us who the spectators are and why they spectate; ii) we strive to understand how different stakeholders, like commentators, players, crowds, and game designers, affect the spectator experience; and iii) we infer from the spectators' expressions what makes the game entertaining to watch, forming a theory of distinct types of information asymmetry that create suspense for the spectator. One design implication derived from these findings is that, rather than presenting as much information to the spectator as possible, it is more important for the stakeholders to be able to decide  how  and  when  they uncover that information.", "citation": "Citations (136)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gifford Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Gifford", "Jeff Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang_0002:Jeff"], "pages": 10}
