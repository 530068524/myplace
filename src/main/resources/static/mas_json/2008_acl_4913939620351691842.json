{"title": "Contradictions and Justifications: Extensions to the Textual Entailment Task.", "fields": ["end user", "logical consequence", "test set", "correctness", "textual entailment"], "abstract": "The third PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge (RTE-3) contained an optional task that extended the main entailment task by requiring a system to make three-way entailment decisions (entails, contradicts, neither) and to justify its response. Contradiction was rare in the RTE-3 test set, occurring in only about 10% of the cases, and systems found accurately detecting it difficult. Subsequent analysis of the results shows a test set must contain many more entailment pairs for the three-way decision task than the traditional two-way task to have equal confidence in system comparisons. Each of six human judges representing eventual end users rated the quality of a justification by assigning \u201cunderstandability\u201d and \u201ccorrectness\u201d scores. Ratings of the same justification across judges differed significantly, signaling the need for a better characterization of the justification task.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["National Institute of Standards and Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ellen M.
