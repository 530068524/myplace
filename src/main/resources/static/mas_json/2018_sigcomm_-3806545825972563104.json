{"title": "Sincronia: near-optimal network design for coflows.", "fields": ["scheduling", "approximation algorithm", "network planning and design", "testbed", "transport layer"], "abstract": "We present Sincronia, a near-optimal network design for coflows that can be implemented on top on any transport layer (for flows) that supports priority scheduling. Sincronia achieves this using a key technical result --- we show that given a \"right\" ordering of coflows, any per-flow rate allocation mechanism achieves average coflow completion time within 4X of the optimal as long as (co)flows are prioritized with respect to the ordering.   Sincronia uses a simple greedy mechanism to periodically order all unfinished coflows; each host sets priorities for its flows using corresponding coflow order and offloads the flow scheduling and rate allocation to the underlying priority-enabled transport layer. We evaluate Sincronia over a real testbed comprising 16-servers and commodity switches, and using simulations across a variety of workloads. Evaluation results suggest that Sincronia not only admits a practical, near-optimal design but also improves upon state-of-the-art network designs for coflows (sometimes by as much as 8X).", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Saksham Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Saksham", "Shijin Rajakrishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajakrishnan:Shijin", "Akshay Narayan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayan:Akshay", "Rachit Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal_0001:Rachit", "David Shmoys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shmoys:David", "Amin Vahdat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vahdat:Amin"], "pages": 14}
