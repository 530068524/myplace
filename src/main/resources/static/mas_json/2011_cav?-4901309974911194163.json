In this paper, we present a static program analysis for overlaid data structures. Our analysis implements two main ideas. The first is to run multiple sub-analyses that track information about non-overlaid data structures, such as lists. Each sub-analysis infers shape properties of only one component of an overlaid data structure, but the results of these sub-analyses are later combined to derive the desired safety properties about the whole overlaid data structure. The second idea is to control the communication among the sub-analyses using ghost states and ghost instructions. The purpose of this control is to achieve a high level of efficiency by allowing only necessary information to be transferred among sub-analyses and at as few program points as possible. Our analysis has been successfully applied to prove the memory safety of the Linux deadline IO scheduler and AFS server.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Queen Mary University of London", "University of Oxford", "Queen Mary University of London", "Hanyang University", "University of Oxford", "Queen Mary University of London"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Oukseh Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Oukseh", "Hongseok Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Hongseok", "Rasmus Petersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petersen:Rasmus"], "pages": 17}
