A number of techniques are increasingly used in industrial setting to verify hardware and software systems, both against models and concrete implementations. While it is generally accepted that obstacles still remain, notably handling infinite state systems efficiently, much of current work involves refining and improving existing techniques such as predicate abstraction.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London", "Universit degli ... rico II, Italy", "Universit degli ... rico II, Italy"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Petr Cerm\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cerm=aacute=k:Petr", "Alessio Lomuscio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lomuscio:Alessio", "Fabio Mogavero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mogavero:Fabio", "Aniello Murano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murano:Aniello"], "pages": 8}
