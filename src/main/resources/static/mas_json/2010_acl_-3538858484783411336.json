{"title": "Learning Script Knowledge with Web Experiments.", "fields": ["graph", "machine learning", "the internet", "unsupervised learning", "multiple sequence alignment"], "abstract": "We describe a novel approach to unsupervised learning of the events that make up a script, along with constraints on their temporal ordering. We collect natural-language descriptions of script-specific event sequences from volunteers over the Internet. Then we compute a graph representation of the script's temporal structure using a multiple sequence alignment algorithm. The evaluation of our system shows that we outperform two informed baselines.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Michaela Regneri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Regneri:Michaela", "Alexander Koller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koller:Alexander", "Manfred Pinkal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinkal:Manfred"], "pages": 10}
