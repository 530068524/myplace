{"title": "XQSE: An XQuery Scripting Extension for the AquaLogic Data Services Platform.", "fields": ["data as a service", "xquery", "query language", "distributed database", "scripting language"], "abstract": "The AquaLogic Data Services Platform (ALDSP) is a BEA middleware platform for creating services that access and manipulate information drawn from multiple heterogeneous sources of data. The integration logic for read services is specified declaratively using the XQuery language. ALDSP 3.0, available in December 2007, includes a new XQuery-based Scripting Extension - XQSE - that enables developers to write procedural as well as declarative logic without leaving the XQuery world. In this paper, we describe the XQSE extensions to XQuery and show how they help to support important new classes of data services in ALDSP 3.0.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["BEA Syst., Inc., San Jose, CA", "BEA Syst., Inc., San Jose, CA", "BEA Syst., Inc., San Jose, CA", "BEA Syst., Inc., San Jose, CA", "BEA Syst., Inc., San Jose, CA"], "authors": ["Vinayak R.
