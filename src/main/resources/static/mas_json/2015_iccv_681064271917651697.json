[8]. We observe that the standard likelihood term in these formu- lations corresponds to a generalized probabilistic K-means energy. In learning it is well known that this energy has a strong bias to clusters of equal size [11], which we express as a penalty for KL divergence from a uniform distribution of cardinalities. However, this volumetric bias has been mostly ignored in computer vision. We demonstrate signif- icant artifacts in standard segmentation and reconstruction methods due to this bias. Moreover, we propose binary and multi-label optimization techniques that either (a) remove this bias or (b) replace it by a KL divergence term for any given target volume distribution. Our general ideas apply to continuous or discrete energy formulations in segmenta- tion, stereo, and other reconstruction problems.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Western Ontario", "University of Western Ontario", "Lund University", "\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yuri Boykov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boykov:Yuri", "Hossam N.
