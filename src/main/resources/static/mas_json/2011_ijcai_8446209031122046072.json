Traditional LfD methods use demonstrations as training examples for supervised learning, but complex tasks can require more examples than is practical to obtain. We present Abstraction from Demonstration (AfD), a novel form of LfD that uses demonstrations to infer state abstractions and reinforcement learning (RL) methods in those abstract state spaces to build a policy. Empirical results show that AfD is greater than an order of magnitude more sample efficient than just using demonstrations as training examples, and exponentially faster than RL alone.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Luis C.
