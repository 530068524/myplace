Beyond the 4-V or 5-V characters of big datasets, the data processing shows the features like inexact, incremental, and inductive manner. This brings new research opportunities to research community across theory, systems, algorithms, and applications. Is there some new \"theory\" for the big data? How to handle the data computing algorithms in an operatable manner? This report shares some view on new challenges identified, and covers some of the application scenarios such as micro-blog data analysis and data processing in building next generation search engines.", "citation": "Citations (375)", "departments": ["Baidu", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Google"], "authors": ["Mu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mu", "David G.
