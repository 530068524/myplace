This work proposes a strategy for identifying neural networks characterized by time- and frequency-dependent connectivity patterns, using convolutional dictionary learning that links spike-train data to local field potentials (LFPs) across multiple areas of the brain. Analytical contributions are: (i) modeling dynamic relationships between LFPs and spikes; (ii) describing the relationships between spikes and LFPs, by analyzing the ability to predict LFP data from one region based on spiking information from across the brain; and (iii) development of a clustering methodology that allows inference of similarities in neurons from multiple regions. Results are based on data sets in which spike and LFP data are recorded simultaneously from up to 16 brain regions in a mouse.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["David E.
