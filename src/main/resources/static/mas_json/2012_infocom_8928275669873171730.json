One main challenge in the design of such codes is the exact repair problem: if a node storing encoded information fails, in order to maintain the same level of reliability we need to create encoded information at a new node. One of the main open problems in this emerging area has been the design of simple coding schemes that allow exact and low cost repair of failed nodes and have high data rates. In particular, all prior known explicit constructions have data rates bounded by 1/2. In this paper we introduce the first family of distributed storage codes that have simple look-up repair and can achieve rates up to 2/3. Our constructions are very simple to implement and perform exact repair by simple XORing of packets. We experimentally evaluate the proposed codes in a realistic cloud storage simulator and show significant benefits in both performance and reliability compared to replication and standard Reed-Solomon codes.", "citation": "Citations (169)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Data Domain", "University of Southern California", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Dimitris S.
