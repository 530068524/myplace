{"title": "Distribution-oriented Aesthetics Assessment for Image Search.", "fields": ["data mining", "aesthetics", "computer science", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Aesthetics has become increasingly prominent for image search to enhance user satisfaction. Therefore, image aesthetics assessment is emerging as a promising research topic in recent years. In this paper, distinguished from existing studies relying on a single label, we propose to quantify the image aesthetics by a distribution over quality levels. The distribution representation can effectively characterize the disagreement among the aesthetic perceptions of users regarding the same image. Our framework is developed on the foundation of label distribution learning, in which the reliability of training examples and the correlations between quality levels are fully taken into account. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets well verified the potential of our approach for aesthetics assessment. The role of aesthetics in image search was also rigorously investigated.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Shandong University of Finance and Economics", "Shandong University", "Shandong University", "Shandong University of Finance and Economics", "Shandong University of Finance and Economics"], "authors": ["Chaoran Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Chaoran", "Huidi Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Huidi", "Xiang Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Xiang", "Xiushan Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Xiushan", "Hongshuai Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Hongshuai", "Yilong Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Yilong"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
