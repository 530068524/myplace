{"title": "PinPlace: associate semantic meanings with indoor locations without active fingerprinting.", "fields": ["multimedia", "phone", "location based service", "internet privacy", "granularity"], "abstract": "Web map services today, such as Google and Bing maps, have digitalized a great portion of the physical world into easily accessible location databases. After the industry invested huge efforts in gathering related information, a user now can search a physical location on the map and know what kind of place it is, known as reverse geo-coding. However, this functionality is mostly limited to public outdoor locations and to building level granularity. We believe that many services can benefit from knowing the semantic meanings of fine-grained locations including indoor places. For example, the phone can mute and delay incoming calls when a user enters a meeting room. Cameras can be disabled in bathrooms to protect users' privacy. In this paper, we present  PinPlace , an on-device service that can automatically associate semantic meanings with outdoor and indoor locations using the activity, transit, and time related features.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung", "Samsung"], "authors": ["Xuan Bao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bao:Xuan", "Bin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Bin", "Bo Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Bo", "Bing Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu_0001:Bing", "Deguang Kong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kong:Deguang", "Hongxia Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Hongxia"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2015", "pages": 5}
