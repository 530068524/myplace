{"title": "Multiprocessor Feasibility Analysis of Recurrent Task Systems with Specified Processor Affinities.", "fields": ["affinity mask", "symmetric multiprocessor system", "multiprocessor scheduling", "multiprocessing", "metrical task system"], "abstract": "In many current multiprocessor real-time operating systems, programmers have the ability to set affinity masks that pin a process to a specified subset of the processors in the system. Given a real-time task system consisting of a collection of implicit-deadline sporadic tasks with an affinity mask specified for each task that is to be implemented upon an identical multiprocessor platform, this paper addresses the question of determining whether the task system can be implemented upon the platform to always meet all deadlines, while respecting the affinity mask restrictions. An algorithm is derived that answers this question efficiently in run-time that is polynomial in the representation of the task system.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "External Organizations"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Sanjoy Baruah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baruah:Sanjoy", "Bj\u00f6rn B.
