{"title": "Beyond Talagrand functions: new lower bounds for testing monotonicity and unateness.", "fields": ["property testing", "boolean function", "adaptive algorithm", "monotonic function", "monotone polygon"], "abstract": "We prove a lower bound of I\u00a9( n  1/3 ) for the query complexity of any two-sided and adaptive algorithm that tests whether an unknown Boolean function  f :{0,1}  n  \u00e2   {0,1} is monotone versus far from monotone. This improves the recent lower bound of I\u00a9( n  1/4 ) for the same problem by Belovs and Blais (STOC\u00e2  16). Our result builds on a new family of random Boolean functions that can be viewed as a two-level extension of Talagrand\u00e2  s random DNFs.   Beyond monotonicity we prove a lower bound of I\u00a9(\u00e2   n ) for two-sided, adaptive algorithms and a lower bound of I\u00a9( n ) for one-sided, non-adaptive algorithms for testing unateness, a natural generalization of monotonicity. The latter matches the linear upper bounds by Khot and Shinkar (RANDOM\u00e2  16) and by Baleshzar, Chakrabarty, Pallavoor, Raskhodnikova, and Seshadhri (2017).", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Xi", "Erik Waingarten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Waingarten:Erik", "Jinyu Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Jinyu"], "pages": 14}
