{"title": "Interdependent Multi-Issue Negotiation for Energy Exchange in Remote Communities.", "fields": ["negotiation", "home automation", "subgame perfect equilibrium", "energy management", "scalability", "interdependence"], "abstract": "We present a novel negotiation protocol to facilitate energy exchange between off-grid homes that are equipped with renewable energy generation and electricity storage. Our protocol imposes restrictions over negotiation such that it reduces the complex interdependent multi-issue negotiation to one where agents have a strategy profile in subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. We show that our negotiation protocol is tractable, concurrent, scalable and leads to Pareto-optimal outcomes in a decentralised manner. We empirically evaluate our protocol and show that, in this instance, a society of agents can (i) improve the overall utilities by 14% and (ii) reduce their overall use of the batteries by 37%.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Muddasser Alam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alam:Muddasser", "Alex Rogers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rogers:Alex", "Sarvapali D.
