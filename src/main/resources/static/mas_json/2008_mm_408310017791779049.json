{"title": "Search trails using user feedback to improve video search.", "fields": ["computer science", "multimedia", "information space", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "In this paper we present an innovative approach for aiding users in the difficult task of video search. We use community based feedback mined from the interactions of previous users of our video search system to aid users in their search tasks. This feedback is the basis for providing recommendations to users of our video retrieval system. The ultimate goal of this system is to improve the quality of the results that users find, and in doing so, help users to explore a large and difficult information space and help them consider search options that they may not have considered otherwise. In particular we wish to make the difficult task of search for video much easier for users. The results of a user evaluation indicate that we achieved our goals, the performance of the users in retrieving relevant videos improved, and users were able to explore the collection to a greater extent.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "Autonomous University of Madrid", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow"], "authors": ["Frank Hopfgartner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hopfgartner:Frank", "David Vallet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vallet:David", "Martin Halvey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halvey:Martin", "Joemon M.
