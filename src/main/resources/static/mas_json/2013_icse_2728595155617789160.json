Feature location has been an active research area for more than two decades. However, there is lack of publicly available, large scale benchmarks for evaluating and comparing feature location approaches. In this paper, we present a Linux-Kernel based benchmark for feature location research (video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=_HihwRNeK3I). This benchmark is large scale and extensible. By providing rich feature and program information and accurate ground-truth links between features and code units, it supports the evaluation of a wide range of feature location approaches. It allows researchers to gain deeper insights into existing approaches and how they can be improved. It also enables communication and collaboration among different researchers.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Zhenchang Xing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xing:Zhenchang", "Yinxing Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Yinxing", "Stan Jarzabek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jarzabek:Stan"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
