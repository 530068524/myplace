{"title": "An Unsupervised Approach to Anomaly Detection in Music Datasets.", "fields": ["clips", "music information retrieval", "anomaly detection", "categorical variable", "estimation"], "abstract": "This paper presents an unsupervised method for systematically identifying anomalies in music datasets. The model integrates categorical regression and robust estimation techniques to infer anomalous scores in music clips. When applied to a music genre recognition dataset, the new method is able to detect corrupted, distorted, or mislabeled audio samples based on commonly used features in music information retrieval. The evaluation results show that the algorithm outperforms other anomaly detection methods and is capable of finding problematic samples identified by human experts. The proposed method introduces a preliminary framework for anomaly detection in music data that can serve as a useful tool to improve data integrity in the future.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Virginia Tech", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yen-Cheng Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yen=Cheng", "Chih-Wei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Chih=Wei", "Chang-Tien Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Chang=Tien", "Alexander Lerch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lerch:Alexander"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
