{"title": "A practical traffic management system for integrated LTE-WiFi networks.", "fields": ["operator", "management system", "network interface", "quality of experience", "testbed"], "abstract": "Mobile operators are leveraging WiFi to relieve the pressure posed on their networks by the surging bandwidth demand of applications. However, operators often lack intelligent mechanisms to control the way users access their WiFi networks. This lack of sophisticated control creates poor network utilization, which in turn degrades the quality of experience (QoE). To meet user traffic demands, it is evident that operators need solutions that optimally balance user traffic across cellular and WiFi networks. Motivated by the lack of practical solutions in this space, we design and implement ATOM - an end-to-end system for adaptive traffic offloading for WiFi-LTE deployments. ATOM has two novel components: (i) A network interface selection algorithm that maps user traffic across WiFi and LTE to optimize user QoE and (ii) an interface switching service that seamlessly re-directs ongoing user sessions in a cost-effective and standards-compatible manner. Our evaluations on a real LTE-WiFi testbed using YouTube traffic reveals that ATOM reduces video stalls by 3-4 times compared to naive solutions.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Rutgers University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Rajesh Mahindra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahindra:Rajesh", "Harish Viswanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viswanathan:Harish", "Karthik Sundaresan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundaresan:Karthik", "Mustafa Y.
