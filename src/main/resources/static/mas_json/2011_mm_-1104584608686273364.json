The social psychology literature has coined the name personality state to refer to a specific behavioral episode wherein a person behaves as more or less introvert/extrovert, neurotic or open to experience, etc. Personality traits can then be reconstructed as density distributions over personality states. Different machine learning approaches were used to test the effectiveness of the selected features in modeling the dynamics of personality states.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Trento", "University of Trento", "University of Trento", "FBK, Trento, Italy", "FBK, Trento, Italy"], "authors": ["Jacopo Staiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Staiano:Jacopo", "Bruno Lepri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepri:Bruno", "Subramanian Ramanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanathan:Subramanian", "Nicu Sebe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebe:Nicu", "Fabio Pianesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pianesi:Fabio"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
