While several recent papers have approached the general question of which properties are elicitable, we suggest that this is the wrong question\u2014all properties are elicitable by first eliciting the entire distribution or data set, and thus the important question is how elicitable. Specifically, what is the minimum number of regression parameters needed to compute the property? Building on previous work, we introduce a new notion of elicitation complexity and lay the foundations for a calculus of elicitation. We establish several general results and techniques for proving upper and lower bounds on elicitation complexity. These results provide tight bounds for eliciting the Bayes risk of any loss, a large class of properties which includes spectral risk measures and several new properties of interest.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Rafael M.
