The polynomial approximations that we construct $\\epsilon$-simulate (as opposed to ``simulate'') the original system, and at the same time are tight. We show that for systems that we call \\emph{tolerant}, safety verification of a system can be reduced to the safety verification of the polynomial approximation. Our main technical tool in proving this result is a logical characterization of $\\epsilon$-simulations. We demonstrate the construction of the polynomial approximation, as well as the verification process, by applying it to an example protocol in air traffic coordination.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Lund University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Pavithra Prabhakar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakar:Pavithra", "Vladimeros Vladimerou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vladimerou:Vladimeros", "Mahesh Viswanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viswanathan_0001:Mahesh", "Geir E.
