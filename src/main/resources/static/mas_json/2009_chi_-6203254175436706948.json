We employ a video-centered approach, creating and combining multimedia contents of different formats with a story-telling education video. With the support of new display form factors in the environment, viewing a sequential educational video thread is replaced by the immersive learning experience of hands-on exploration and manipulation in a multi-dimensional information space. We demonstrate CThru with an animation clip in cellular biology, supplementing visible objects in the video with rich domain-specific multimedia information and interactive 3D models. We describe CThru's design rationale and implementation. We also discuss a pilot study and what it revealed with respect to CThru's interface and the usage pattern of the tabletop and the associated large wall display.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Harvard University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Hao Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Hao", "Alain Viel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viel:Alain", "Meekal Bajaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bajaj:Meekal", "Robert A.
