{"title": "Understanding idle behavior and power gating mechanisms in the context of modern benchmarks on CPU-GPU Integrated systems.", "fields": ["transistor", "power gating", "idle", "cache", "overhead"], "abstract": "Overall energy consumption In modern computing systems Is significantly Impacted by Idle power. Power gating, also known as C6, Is an effective mechanism to reduce Idle power. However, C6 entry Incurs non-trivial overheads and can cause negative savings If the Idle duration Is short. As CPUs become tightly Integrated with GPUs and other accelerators, the Incidence of short duration Idle events are becoming Increasingly common. Even when Idle durations are long, It may still not be beneficial to power gate because of the overheads of cache flushing, especially with FinFET transistors. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of idleness behavior of modern CPU workloads, consisting of both consumer and CPU-GPU benchmarks. It proposes techniques to accurately predict idle durations and develops power gating mechanisms that account for dynamic variations in the break-even point caused by varying cache dirtiness. Accounting for variations in the break-even point is even more important for FinFET transistors. In systems with FinFET transistors, the proposed mechanisms provide average energy reduction exceeding 8% and up to 36% over three currently employed schemes.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Advanced Micro Devices", "University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Manish Arora.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arora:Manish", "Srilatha Manne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manne:Srilatha", "Indrani Paul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paul:Indrani", "Nuwan Jayasena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jayasena:Nuwan", "Dean M.
