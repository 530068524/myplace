Particular implementations feature integration of compression operations and mode selection with a beltway mechanism that takes advantage of atomic locking mechanisms supported by certain classes of hardware processors to handle the tasks that require atomic access to data structures while also reducing the overhead associated with these atomic locking mechanisms.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Audi", "Packeteer, Inc. ... ertino, CA, US)", "Packeteer, Inc. ... ertino, CA, US)", "Intentionet"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Ryan Beckett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beckett:Ryan", "Aarti Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Aarti", "Ratul Mahajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahajan:Ratul", "David Walker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walker:David"], "pages": 14}
