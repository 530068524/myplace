{"title": "Supporting rehabilitation after hip replacement with a mobile device carried in a pocket.", "fields": ["physical medicine and rehabilitation", "wearable computer", "embedded system", "mobile device", "rehabilitation"], "abstract": "Hip replacement surgery is a procedure undertaken to relieve pain and restore function of a hip joint. Rehabilitation after a hip replacement surgery can last several months. Currently, orthopedists lack information about patients' rehabilitation progress and rely solely on subjective observations in order to decide for a treatment. Previous research on the field of hip replacement surgery has studied the use of wearable sensors to warn patients about movements that could lead to hip dislocation. In this work, we use a mobile device as a means to gain information about the rehabilitation progress after a hip replacement. Results from a study conducted with 12 patients of hip replacement indicate that our approach can classify the kind of walking aid used by patients with an accuracy of 93.3% and provide a gait score that correlates to standard gait scores used by physical therapists with an accuracy of 99.1%.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Krankenhaus Bar ...
