No satisfying solution exists for maintaining the alignment of access control policies with the business logic. Current implementations of access control rely on the separation between the policy and the application code. In practice, this separation is not so strict and some rules are hard-coded within the application, making the evolution of the policy difficult. We propose a new methodology for implementing security-driven applications. From a policy defined by a security expert, we generate an architectural model, reflecting the access control policy. We leverage the advances in the  models@runtime  domain to keep this model synchronized with the running system. When the policy is updated, the architectural model is updated, which in turn reconfigures the running system. As a proof of concept, we apply the approach to the development of a library management system.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Bretagne", "SINTEF", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Rennes"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Brice Morin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morin:Brice", "Tejeddine Mouelhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mouelhi:Tejeddine", "Franck Fleurey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fleurey:Franck", "Yves Le Traon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traon:Yves_Le", "Olivier Barais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barais:Olivier", "Jean-Marc J\u00e9z\u00e9quel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=eacute=z=eacute=quel:Jean=Marc"], "pages": 10}
