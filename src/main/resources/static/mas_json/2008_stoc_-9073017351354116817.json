Given a graph G(V,E) with costs on edges, the goal of SNDP is to find a minimum cost subset of edges that ensures a given set of pairwise  vertex connectivity  requirements. When all connectivity requirements are between a special vertex, called the  source , and vertices in a subset T \u2286 V, called  terminals , the problem is called the  single-source  SNDP. Our main result is a randomized k O(k 2 )  log 4 n-approximation algorithm for single-source SNDP where k denotes the largest connectivity requirement for any source-terminal pair. In particular, we get a poly-logarithmic approximation for any constant k. Prior to our work, no non-trivial approximation guarantees were known for this problem for any k \u2265 3. We also show that SNDP is k \u03a9(1) -hard to approximate and provide an elementary construction that shows that the well-studied set-pair linear programming relaxation for this problem has an \u03a9(k 1/3 ) integrality gap.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "Toyota Technological Institute", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Tanmoy Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty_0001:Tanmoy", "Julia Chuzhoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuzhoy:Julia", "Sanjeev Khanna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khanna:Sanjeev"], "pages": 10}
