We show that together with the underlying rate control algorithm, the rarest first algorithm and choking algorithm in BitTorrent protocol implicitly solve a cooperative combinatorial network utility maximization problem in a distributed manner. This understanding allows us to access properties of BitTorrent from a fresh perspective, including performance optimality, convergence and impacts of design parameters. Our numerical evaluations validate the analytical results.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of California, Berkeley", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Ziyu Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Ziyu", "Hao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0006:Hao", "Minghua Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Minghua", "Kannan Ramchandran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramchandran:Kannan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
