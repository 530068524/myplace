{"title": "Synthesizing Dynamic Patterns by Spatial-Temporal Generative ConvNet.", "fields": ["data modeling", "generative grammar", "log probability", "speech coding", "iterated function"], "abstract": "Video sequences contain rich dynamic patterns, such as dynamic texture patterns that exhibit stationarity in the temporal domain, and action patterns that are non-stationary in either spatial or temporal domain. We show that a spatial-temporal generative ConvNet can be used to model and synthesize dynamic patterns. The model defines a probability distribution on the video sequence, and the log probability is defined by a spatial-temporal ConvNet that consists of multiple layers of spatial-temporal filters to capture spatial-temporal patterns of different scales. The model can be learned from the training video sequences by an analysis by synthesis learning algorithm that iterates the following two steps. Step 1 synthesizes video sequences from the currently learned model. Step 2 then updates the model parameters based on the difference between the synthesized video sequences and the observed training sequences. We show that the learning algorithm can synthesize realistic dynamic patterns.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jianwen Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Jianwen", "Song-Chun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Song=Chun", "Ying Nian Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Ying_Nian"], "pages": 9}
