{"title": "Heterogeneous multimedia data semantics mining using content and location context.", "fields": ["relevance feedback", "graph", "multimedia information retrieval", "semantics", "modalities"], "abstract": "Because it is very common that the heterogeneous multimedia data of the same semantics always exist jointly in many domain and application specific databases, it is very helpful to consider the location information when analyzing multimedia data. In this paper we propose a method of integrating the content and location context for multimedia data mining to enable the cross-media retrieval, by which the query examples and the returned results can be of different modalities, e.g. to query audios by an example of image. We construct a graph model by combing the multimedia content and location information. The graph model is then refined according to different strategies. The semantic correlations among multimedia data are calculated by learning the high-order neighborhood structure of the graph and the Multimedia Correlation Space is constructed in which the cross-media retrieval can be performed. We also propose different methods of Relevance Feedback to improve the search results. Experiments demonstrate the promise of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yi", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting", "Wenhua Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wenhua"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
