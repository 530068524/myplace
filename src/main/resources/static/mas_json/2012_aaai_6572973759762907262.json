{"title": "Relative Attributes for Enhanced Human-Machine Communication.", "fields": ["ranking", "relative strength", "discriminative model", "training set", "human machine system"], "abstract": "We propose to model relative attributes that capture the relationships between images and objects in terms of human-nameable visual properties. For example, the models can capture that animal A is 'furrier' than animal B, or image X is 'brighter' than image B. Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to different attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images. We show how these relative attribute predictions enable a variety of novel applications, including zero-shot learning from relative comparisons, automatic image description, image search with interactive feedback, and active learning of discriminative classifiers. We overview results demonstrating these applications with images of faces and natural scenes. Overall, we find that relative attributes enhance the precision of communication between humans and computer vision algorithms, providing the richer language needed to fluidly \"teach\" a system about visual concepts.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute", "University of Texas at Austin", "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Devi Parikh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parikh:Devi", "Adriana Kovashka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kovashka:Adriana", "Amar Parkash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parkash:Amar", "Kristen Grauman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grauman:Kristen"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
