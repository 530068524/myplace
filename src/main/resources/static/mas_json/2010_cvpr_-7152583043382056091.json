{"title": "Object recognition as ranking holistic figure-ground hypotheses.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "ground truth", "object detection", "ranking", "caltech 101"], "abstract": "We present an approach to visual object-class recognition and segmentation based on a pipeline that combines multiple, holistic figure-ground hypotheses generated in a bottom-up, object independent process. Decisions are performed based on continuous estimates of the spatial overlap between image segment hypotheses and each putative class. We differ from existing approaches not only in our seemingly unreasonable assumption that good object-level segments can be obtained in a feed-forward fashion, but also in framing recognition as a regression problem. Instead of focusing on a one-vs-all winning margin that can scramble ordering inside the non-maximum (non-winning) set, learning produces a globally consistent ranking with close ties to segment quality, hence to the extent entire object or part hypotheses spatially overlap with the ground truth. We demonstrate results beyond the current state of the art for image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, in a number of challenging datasets including Caltech-101, ETHZ-Shape and PASCAL VOC 2009.", "citation": "Citations (139)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Bonn", "University of Bonn", "University of Bonn"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Fuxin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Fuxin", "Jo\u00e3o Carreira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carreira:Jo=atilde=o", "Cristian Sminchisescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sminchisescu:Cristian"], "pages": 8}
