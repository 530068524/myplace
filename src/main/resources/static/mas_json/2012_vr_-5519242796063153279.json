The observers were asked to estimate the relative depth of spheres verbally in virtual and actual environments. Constant apparent sized stimuli were used to measure the just-noticeable difference in depth perception, thus avoiding providing a size gradient cue. Results of the experiments revealed individual differences in virtual reality in contrast to reality. Specifically a subgroup of observers had difficulty perceiving the depth of virtual spheres in virtual reality, which may indicate that they rely on apparent size for judging depth. Furthermore, the just-noticeable differences were more variable in the virtual environment than with real objects. Our results reveal individual differences when the disparity-driven convergence cue is the only distance cue provided in virtual reality.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Bielefeld University", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"], "authors": ["Abdeldjallil Naceri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naceri:Abdeldjallil", "Ryad Chellali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chellali:Ryad"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
