The idea is to use images collected from the Web to learn representations of actions and use this knowledge to automatically annotate actions in videos. Our approach is unsupervised in the sense that it requires no human intervention other than the text querying. Its benefits are two-fold: 1) we can improve retrieval of action images, and 2) we can collect a large generic database of action poses, which can then be used in tagging videos. We present experimental evidence that using action images collected from the Web, annotating actions is possible.", "citation": "Citations (139)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Boston University", "Boston University", "Boston University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Nazli Ikizler-Cinbis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikizler=Cinbis:Nazli", "Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cinbis:Ramazan_Gokberk", "Stan Sclaroff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sclaroff:Stan"], "pages": 8}
