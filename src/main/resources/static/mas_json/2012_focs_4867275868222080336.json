{"title": "A Tight Linear Time (1/2)-Approximation for Unconstrained Submodular Maximization.", "fields": ["facility location problem", "submodular set function", "greedy randomized adaptive search procedure", "maximization", "maximum coverage problem", "greedy algorithm", "approximation algorithm"], "abstract": "We consider the \\sf Unconstrained Submodular Maximization problem in which we are given a nonnegative submodular function $f:2^{\\mathcal{N}}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^+$, and the objective is to find a subset $S\\subseteq \\mathcal{N}$ maximizing $f(S)$. This is one of the most basic submodular optimization problems, having a wide range of applications. Some well-known problems captured by \\sf Unconstrained Submodular Maximization include \\sf Max-Cut, \\sf Max-DiCut, and variants of \\sf Max-SAT and maximum facility location. We present a simple randomized linear time algorithm achieving a tight approximation guarantee of 1/2, thus matching the known hardness result of Feige, Mirrokni, and Vondrak [SIAM J. Comput., 40 (2011), pp. 1133--1153]. Our algorithm is based on an adaptation of the greedy approach which exploits certain symmetry properties of the problem.", "citation": "Citations (249)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Microsoft"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Niv Buchbinder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buchbinder:Niv", "Moran Feldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldman:Moran", "Joseph Naor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naor:Joseph", "Roy Schwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schwartz:Roy"], "pages": 10}
