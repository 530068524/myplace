{"title": "Attractive phones don't have to work better: independent effects of attractiveness, effectiveness, and efficiency on perceived usability.", "fields": ["attractiveness", "need for cognition", "system usability scale", "mobile phone", "usability goals"], "abstract": "Participants sometimes rate products high in usability despite experiencing obvious usability problems (low effectiveness or efficiency). Is it possible that this occurs because high product attractiveness compensates for low effectiveness/efficiency? Previous research has not investigated the interplay between attractiveness, effectiveness, and efficiency to determine whether attractiveness accounts for additional variance in usability ratings beyond that which is explained by effectiveness and efficiency. The present research provides the first test of this idea. Using data from usability testing, we demonstrate that attractiveness, effectiveness, and efficiency each has an independent influence on usability ratings and, in the present research, attractiveness had the largest impact. We report results of quantitative analyses that suggest multiple mechanisms could be responsible for the relationship between attractiveness and usability.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Sprint Corporation", "Sprint Corporation"], "authors": ["Jeffrey M.
