The model results shed light on the applicability of evolved access procedures and help understand how many devices can be served per base station. In addition, considering the simultaneous presence of different traffic classes, we investigate the effectiveness of prioritised access, exploiting access class barring techniques. Our model shows that, even with the sub-millisecond time slots foreseen in LTE Advanced Pro and 5G, a base station can accommodate at most few thousand devices to guarantee access latencies below 100 ms with high transmission success probabilities. This calls for a rethinking of wireless access strategies to avoid ultra-dense cell deployments within smart factory infrastructures.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Turin", "IMDEA", "University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin"], "authors": ["Paolo Castagno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castagno:Paolo", "Vincenzo Mancuso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mancuso:Vincenzo", "Matteo Sereno.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sereno:Matteo", "Marco Ajmone Marsan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marsan:Marco_Ajmone"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
