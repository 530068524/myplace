Orchid provides an abstract operator model that serves as a common model for both transformation paradigms; both mappings and ETL jobs are transformed into instances of this common model. As an additional benefit, instances of this common model can be optimized and deployed into multiple target environments. Orchid is being deployed in  FastTrack , a data transformation toolkit in IBM Information Server.", "citation": "Citations (81)", "departments": ["Kaiserslautern University of Technology", "IBM", "Harvard University", "University of Miami", "University of Miami"], "authors": ["Stefan Dessloch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dessloch:Stefan", "Mauricio A.
