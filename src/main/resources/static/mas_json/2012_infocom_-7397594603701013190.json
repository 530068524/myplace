In wireless camera sensor networks, the cameras take the images or videos of target objects, the position and angle of camera sensor impact on the sense range. Therefore, the barrier coverage problem in camera sensor network is different from scalar sensor network. In this paper, based on the definition of full-view coverage, we focus on the Minimum Camera Barrier Coverage Problem (MCBCP) in wireless camera sensor networks in which the camera sensors are deployed randomly in a target field. Firstly, we partition the target field into disjoint subregions which are full-view-covered regions or not-full-view-covered regions. Then we model the full-view-covered regions and their relationship as a weighted directed graph. Based on the graph, we propose an algorithm to find a feasible solution for the MCBCP problem. We also proved the correctness of the solution for the MCBCP problem. Furthermore, we propose an optimal algorithm for the MCBCP problem. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China"], "authors": ["Huan Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Huan", "Meng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Meng", "Deying Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Deying", "Yi Hong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hong_0003:Yi", "Wenping Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wenping"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
