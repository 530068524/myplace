The advantage of such machines is to provide models in the style of the Geometry of Interaction, i.e., An interactive semantics which is close to low-level implementation. On the one hand, we prove that despite the inherent complexity of the framework, interaction is guaranteed to be deadlock-free. On the other hand, the resulting logical system is powerful enough to embed PCF and to adequately model its behaviour, both when call-by-name and when call-by-value evaluation are considered. This is not the case for single-token stateless interactive machines.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Bologna", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Paris", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Ugo Dal Lago.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lago:Ugo_Dal", "Claudia Faggian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Faggian:Claudia", "Beno\u00eet Valiron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valiron:Beno=icirc=t", "Akira Yoshimizu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshimizu:Akira"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 14}
