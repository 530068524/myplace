A fundamental problem concerning these classes is the Permanent and Determinant Problem: Given a field F of characteristic \u22602, and an integer n, what is the minimum m such that the permanent of an n x n matrix X=(x ij ) can be expressed as a determinant of an m x m matrix, where the entries of the determinant matrix are affine linear functions of x ij 's, and the equality is in F [X]. Mignon and Ressayre (2004) [11] proved a quadratic lower bound m=\u03a9(n 2 ) for fields of characteristic 0. We extend the Mignon-Ressayre quadratic lower bound to all fields of characteristic \u22602.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Institute for Advanced Study"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Jin-yi Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Jin=yi", "Xi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Xi", "Dong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dong"], "pages": 8}
