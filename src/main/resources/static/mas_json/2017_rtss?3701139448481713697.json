{"title": "End-to-End Network Delay Guarantees for Real-Time Systems Using SDN.", "fields": ["network packet", "heuristic", "network delay", "overhead", "end to end principle"], "abstract": "Real-time systems (RTS) require end-to-end delay guarantees for the delivery of network packets. In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the management and integration overheads for such real-time (RT) network flows by leveraging the capabilities of software-defined networking (SDN) \u2013 capabilities that include global visibility and management of the network. Given the specifications of flows that must meet hard real-time requirements, our framework synthesizes paths through the network. To guarantee that these flows meet both, their bandwidth and end-to-end timing requirements, our framework solves a multi-constraint optimization problem using a heuristic algorithm. We use exhaustive emulations and experiments on hardware switches to demonstrate our techniques and feasibility of our approach. As a result of this work, SDNs become \u201cdelay-aware\u201d and thus can be adapted for use in safety-critical and other delay-sensitive applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "PES University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Rakesh Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Rakesh", "Monowar Hasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasan:Monowar", "Smruti Padhy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Padhy:Smruti", "Konstantin Evchenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Evchenko:Konstantin", "Lavanya Piramanayagam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piramanayagam:Lavanya", "Sibin Mohan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohan:Sibin", "Rakesh B.
