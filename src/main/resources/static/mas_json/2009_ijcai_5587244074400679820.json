{"title": "Variable and Value Ordering for MPE Search.", "fields": ["beam search", "inference engine", "branch and bound", "metaheuristic", "best first search"], "abstract": "In Bayesian networks, a most probable explanation (MPE) is a most likely instantiation of all network variables given a piece of evidence. Recent work proposed a branch-and-bound search algorithm that finds exact solutions to MPE queries, where bounds are computed on a relaxed network obtained by a technique known as node splitting. In this work we study the impact of variable and value ordering on such a search algorithm. We study several heuristics based on the entropies of variables and on the notion of nogoods, and propose a new meta-heuristic that combines their strengths. Experiments indicate that search efficiency is significantly improved, allowing many hard problems to be solved for the first time.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Sajjad Ahmed Siddiqi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siddiqi:Sajjad_Ahmed", "Jinbo Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Jinbo"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
