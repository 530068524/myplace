{"title": "Mapping Action Language BC to Logic Programs: A Characterization by Postulates.", "fields": ["logic programming", "algorithm", "action language", "philosophy of logic", "semantics"], "abstract": "We have earlier shown that the standard mappings from action languages B and C to logic programs under answer set semantics can be captured by sets of properties on transition systems. In this paper, we consider action language BC and show that a standard mapping from BC action descriptions to logic programs can be similarly captured when the action rules in the descriptions do not have consistency conditions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Haodi Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haodi", "Fangzhen Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Fangzhen"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
