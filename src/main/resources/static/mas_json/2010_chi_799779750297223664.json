{"title": "Biketastic: sensing and mapping for better biking.", "fields": ["location based service", "architecture", "mobile phone", "environmentally friendly", "participatory sensing"], "abstract": "Bicycling is an affordable, environmentally friendly alternative transportation mode to motorized travel. A common task performed by bikers is to find good routes in an area, where the quality of a route is based on safety, efficiency, and enjoyment. Finding routes involves trial and error as well as exchanging information between members of a bike community. Biketastic is a platform that enriches this experimentation and route sharing process making it both easier and more effective. Using a mobile phone application and online map visualization, bikers are able to document and share routes, ride statistics, sensed information to infer route roughness and noisiness, and media that documents ride experience. Biketastic was designed to ensure the link between information gathering, visualization, and bicycling practices. In this paper, we present architecture and algorithms for route data inferences and visualization. We evaluate the system based on feedback from bicyclists provided during a two-week pilot.", "citation": "Citations (188)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "authors": ["Sasank Reddy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reddy:Sasank", "Katie Shilton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shilton:Katie", "Gleb Denisov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denisov:Gleb", "Christian Cenizal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cenizal:Christian", "Deborah Estrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Estrin:Deborah", "Mani B.
