It can be shown that optimizing for SGNS objective can be viewed as an optimization problem of searching for a good matrix with the low-rank constraint. The most standard way to solve this type of problems is to apply Riemannian optimization framework to optimize the SGNS objective over the manifold of required low-rank matrices. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that optimizes SGNS objective using Riemannian optimization and demonstrates its superiority over popular competitors, such as the original method to train SGNS and SVD over SPPMI matrix.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Yandex", "Yandex", "Skoltech", "Skoltech"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Alexander Fonarev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fonarev:Alexander", "Oleksii Hrinchuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hrinchuk:Oleksii", "Gleb Gusev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gusev:Gleb", "Pavel Serdyukov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serdyukov:Pavel", "Ivan V.
