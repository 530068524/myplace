Many existing hashing approaches encode data with projection-based hash functions and represent each projected dimension by 1-bit. However, the dimensions with high variance hold large energy or information of data but treated equivalently as dimensions with low variance, which leads to a serious information loss. In this paper, we introduce a novel hashing algorithm called Harmonious Hashing which aims at learning hash functions with low information loss. Specifically, we learn a set of optimized projections to preserve the maximum cumulative energy and meet the constraint of equivalent variance on each dimension as much as possible. In this way, we could minimize the information loss after binarization. Despite the extreme simplicity, our method outperforms superiorly to many state-of-the-art hashing methods in large-scale and high-dimensional nearest neighbor search experiments.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Bin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0005:Bin", "Jiajun Bu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bu:Jiajun", "Yue Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Yue", "Chun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chun", "Xiaofei He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiaofei", "Deng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Deng"], "pages": 7}
