{"title": "Conversations with my washing machine: an in-the-wild study of demand shifting with self-generated energy.", "fields": ["microgeneration", "software deployment", "laundry", "photovoltaic system", "sustainability"], "abstract": "Domestic microgeneration is the onsite generation of low- and zero-carbon heat and electricity by private households to meet their own needs. In this paper we explore how an everyday household routine -- that of doing laundry -- can be augmented by digital technologies to help households with photovoltaic solar energy generation to make better use of self-generated energy. This paper presents an 8-month in-the-wild study that involved 18 UK households in longitudinal energy data collection, prototype deployment and participatory data analysis. Through a series of technology interventions mixing energy feedback, proactive suggestions and direct control the study uncovered opportunities, potential rewards and barriers for families to shift energy consuming household activities and highlights how digital technology can act as mediator between household laundry routines and energy demand-shifting behaviors. Finally, the study provides insights into how a \"smart\" energy-aware washing machine shapes organization of domestic life and how people \"communicate\" with their washing machine.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Open University", "Open University", "Open University", "Open University", "University of Nottingham"], "authors": ["Jacky Bourgeois.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bourgeois:Jacky", "Janet van der Linden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linden:Janet_van_der", "Gerd Kortuem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kortuem:Gerd", "Blaine A.
