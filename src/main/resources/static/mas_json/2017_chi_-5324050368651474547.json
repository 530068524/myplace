{"title": "Through the Looking Glass: The Effects of Feedback on Self-Awareness and Conversational Behaviour during Video Chat.", "fields": ["interface design", "personally identifiable information", "self awareness", "video feedback", "remote therapy"], "abstract": "Video chat is a popular form of computer-mediated communication in a range of contexts from online job interviews to chatting with friends. Although seeing your own video feedback is the predominant interface design, self-awareness research suggests that seeing oneself could induce self-consciousness and affect interaction. We created a custom video chat application and asked pairs of strangers to engage in an online personal information exchange task with or without video feedback. Feedback increased self-awareness and the use of socially-focused words, and decreased the use of words expressing certainty. In addition, mixed-gender dyads rated themselves as more socially orientated with feedback than without, which was reflected in an increased use of inclusive pronouns and affiliation words, and fewer words expressing discrepancy. However, with feedback, same-gender dyads reported greater task orientation than mixed-gender dyads reflected in increased use of task-relevant words. We discuss design implications in contexts from remote therapy to online dating.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of S ... oon, SK, Canada"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Matthew K.
