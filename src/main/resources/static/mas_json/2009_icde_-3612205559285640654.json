However, these assumptions are no longer valid in a Peer-based DataBase Management System (PDBMS). As such, it is a challenge to process and optimize queries in a PDBMS. In this paper, we present our distributed solution to this problem for multi-way join queries. Our approach first processes a multi-way join query based on an initial query evaluation plan (generated using statistical data that may be obsolete or inaccurate); as the query is beingprocessed, statistics obtained on-the-fly are used to (continuously) refine the current plan dynamically into a more effective one. We have conducted an extensive performance study which shows that our adaptive query processing strategy can reduce the network traffic significantly.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Sai Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Sai", "Quang Hieu Vu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vu:Quang_Hieu", "Jianzhong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jianzhong", "Kian-Lee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian=Lee"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
