{"title": "Synergistic policy and virtual machine consolidation in cloud data centers.", "fields": ["testbed", "controller", "sync", "disjoint sets", "downtime"], "abstract": "In modern Cloud Data Centers (DC)s, correct implementation of network policies is crucial to provide secure, efficient and high performance services for tenants. It is reported that the inefficient management of network policies accounts for 78% of DC downtime, challenged by the dynamically changing network characteristics and by the effects of dynamic Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation. While there has been significant research in policy and VM management, they have so far been treated as disjoint research problems. In this paper, we explore the simultaneous, dynamic VM and policy consolidation, and formulate the Policy-VM Consolidation (PVC) problem, which is shown to be NP-Hard. We then propose Sync, an efficient and synergistic scheme to jointly consolidate network policies and virtual machines. Extensive evaluation results and a testbed implementation of our controller show that policy and VM migration under Sync significantly reduces flow end-to-end delay by nearly 40%, and network-wide communication cost by 50% within few seconds, while adhering strictly to the requirements of network policies.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Jinan University", "University of Glasgow", "Liverpool John Moores University", "University of Glasgow"], "authors": ["Lin Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Lin", "Richard Cziva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cziva:Richard", "Fung Po Tso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tso:Fung_Po", "Dimitrios P.
