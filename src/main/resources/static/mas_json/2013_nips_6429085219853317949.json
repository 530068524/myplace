Recently Balle et al. presented a spectral algorithm for learning FST from samples of aligned input-output sequences. In this paper we address the more realistic, yet challenging setting where the alignments are unknown to the learning algorithm. We frame FST learning as finding a low rank Hankel matrix satisfying constraints derived from observable statistics. Under this formulation, we provide identifiability results for FST distributions. Then, following previous work on rank minimization, we propose a regularized convex relaxation of this objective which is based on minimizing a nuclear norm penalty subject to linear constraints and can be solved efficiently.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia"], "authors": ["Rapha\u00ebl Bailly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bailly:Rapha=euml=l", "Xavier Carreras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carreras:Xavier", "Ariadna Quattoni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quattoni:Ariadna"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
