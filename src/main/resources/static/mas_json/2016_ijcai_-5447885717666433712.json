Also, how do we rank a group of images precisely and efficiently for specific queries? These problems are critical for researchers and engineers to generate a novel image searching engine. First, it is important to obtain an appropriate description that effectively represent the images. In this paper, multimodal features are considered for describing images. The images unique properties are reflected by visual features, which are correlated to each other. However, semantic gaps always exist between images visual features and semantics. Therefore, we utilize click feature to reduce the semantic gap. The second key issue is learning an appropriate distance metric to combine these multimodal features. This paper develops a novel deep multimodal distance metric learning (Deep-MDML) method. A structured ranking model is adopted to utilize both visual and click features in distance metric learning (DML). Specifically, images and their related ranking results are first collected to form the training set. Multimodal features, including click and visual features, are collected with these images. Next, a group of autoencoders is applied to obtain initially a distance metric in different visual spaces, and an MDML method is used to assign optimal weights for different modalities. Next, we conduct alternating optimization to train the ranking model, which is used for the ranking of new queries with click features. Compared with existing image ranking methods, the proposed method adopts a new ranking model to use multimodal features, including click features and visual features in DML. We operated experiments to analyze the proposed Deep-MDML in two benchmark data sets, and the results validate the effects of the method.", "citation": "Citations (142)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Hangzhou Dianzi University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Hangzhou Dianzi University", "University of Technology, Sydney", "Xiamen University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University", "Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Christian Bessiere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bessiere:Christian", "Emmanuel Hebrard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hebrard:Emmanuel", "George Katsirelos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katsirelos:George", "Zeynep Kiziltan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiziltan:Zeynep", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "pages": 7}
