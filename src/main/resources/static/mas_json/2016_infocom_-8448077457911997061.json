Yet, most recently proposed schemes do not provide performance guarantees and none have been tested at scale. To address the issue of providing high multicast throughput with performance guarantees, we present the design and experimental evaluation of the Multicast Dynamic Rate Adaptation (MuDRA) algorithm. MuDRA balances fast adaptation to channel conditions and stability, which is essential for multimedia applications. MuDRA relies on feedback from some nodes collected via a light-weight protocol and dynamically adjusts the rate adaptation response time. Our experimental evaluation of MuDRA on the ORBIT testbed with over 150 nodes shows that MuDRA outperforms other schemes and supports high throughput multicast flows to hundreds of receivers while meeting quality requirements. MuDRA can support multiple high quality video streams, where 90% of the nodes report excellent or very good video quality.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Bell Labs", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Varun Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta_0002:Varun", "Craig Gutterman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gutterman:Craig", "Yigal Bejerano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bejerano:Yigal", "Gil Zussman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zussman:Gil"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
