This paper generalises ASPIC+ to accommodate classical logic instantiations, and adopts a new proposal for evaluating extensions: attacks are used to define the notion of conflict-free sets, while the defeats obtained by applying preferences to attacks, are exclusively used to determine the acceptability of arguments. Key properties and rationality postulates are then shown to hold for the new framework.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["King's College London", "University of Groningen"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Sanjay Modgil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Modgil:Sanjay", "Henry Prakken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prakken:Henry"], "pages": 6}
