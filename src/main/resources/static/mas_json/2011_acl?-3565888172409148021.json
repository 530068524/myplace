{"title": "Automatic Labelling of Topic Models.", "fields": ["ranking", "information retrieval", "pattern recognition", "topic model", "labelling"], "abstract": "We propose a method for automatically labelling topics learned via LDA topic models. We generate our label candidate set from the top-ranking topic terms, titles of Wikipedia articles containing the top-ranking topic terms, and sub-phrases extracted from the Wikipedia article titles. We rank the label candidates using a combination of association measures and lexical features, optionally fed into a supervised ranking model. Our method is shown to perform strongly over four independent sets of topics, significantly better than a benchmark method.", "citation": "Citations (175)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of California, Irvine", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jey Han Lau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lau:Jey_Han", "Karl Grieser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grieser:Karl", "David Newman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Newman:David", "Timothy Baldwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baldwin:Timothy"], "pages": 10}
