While the detection of individual objects has been improved significantly over the recent years, crowd scenes remain particularly challenging for the detection and tracking tasks due to heavy occlusions, high person densities and significant variation in people's appearance. To address these challenges, we propose to leverage information on the global structure of the scene and to resolve all detections jointly. In particular, we explore constraints imposed by the crowd density and formulate person detection as the optimization of a joint energy function combining crowd density estimation and the localization of individual people. We demonstrate how the optimization of such an energy function significantly improves person detection and tracking in crowds. We validate our approach on a challenging video dataset of crowded scenes.", "citation": "Citations (251)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "University of Paris"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Mikel Rodriguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodriguez:Mikel", "Ivan Laptev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laptev:Ivan", "Josef Sivic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sivic:Josef", "Jean-Yves Audibert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Audibert:Jean=Yves"], "pages": 8}
