Based on an analysis of 30 in-depth interviews with Second Life residents, we examine the extent to which these metaphors can be used to explain experiences of social relationships in and across virtual and material worlds. The data suggest that these metaphors are relevant to social interactions in and across virtual and material environments: individuals perform on a stage to and with others, they gradually reveal layers of themselves, and they distinguish between segments of their identity in different social situations. At the same time, these metaphors do not explain all experiences, pointing to future research on virtual environments, social relationships, and identity management.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Gilly Leshed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leshed:Gilly", "Poppy Lauretta McLeod.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McLeod:Poppy_Lauretta"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
