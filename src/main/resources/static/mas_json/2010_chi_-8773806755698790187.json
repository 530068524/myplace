We describe patterns of usage in a social file-sharing service that was deployed in a large multinational enterprise. Factor analyses revealed four factors:  Upload & Publicize  (regarding one's own files);  Annotate & Watch  (add information to files and maintain awareness);  Discover & Tell  (find files uploaded by other users, and communicate to additional users about those files); and  Refind  (re-use one's own files). We explore the attributes of users who score highly on each of these factors, and we propose implications for design to encourage innovation in usage.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Michael J.
