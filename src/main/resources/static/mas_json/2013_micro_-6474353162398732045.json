{"title": "BulkCommit: scalable and fast commit of atomic blocks in a lazy multiprocessor environment.", "fields": ["directory", "commit", "cache coherence", "three phase commit protocol", "serialization"], "abstract": "To help improve the programmability and performance of shared-memory multiprocessors, there are proposals of architectures that continuously execute atomic blocks of instructions --- also called  Chunks . To be competitive, these architectures must support chunk operations very efficiently. In particular, in a large manycore with lazy conflict detection, they must support efficient chunk commit.   This paper addresses the challenge of providing scalable and fast chunk commit for a large manycore in a lazy environment. To understand the problem, we first present a model of chunk commit in a distributed directory protocol. Then, to attain scalable and fast commit, we propose two general techniques: (1) Serialization of the write sets of output-dependent chunks to avoid squashes and (2) Full parallelization of directory module ownership by the committing chunks. Our simulation results with 64-threaded codes show that our combined scheme, called  BulkCommit , eliminates most of the squash and commit stall times, speeding-up the codes by an average of 40% and 18% compared to previously-proposed schemes.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Valladolid", "Beihang University"], "authors": ["Xuehai Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Xuehai", "Josep Torrellas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torrellas:Josep", "Benjamin Sahelices.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahelices:Benjamin", "Depei Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Depei"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
