In addition to simple filter and aggregation operations, an important task in processing sensor data is data mining - the identification of relevant information and patterns. Limited capabilities of sensor nodes in terms of storage and processing capacity, battery lifetime, and communication demand a power-efficient, preferably sensor-local processing. In this paper, we present AnduIN, a system for developing, deploying, and running in-network data mining tasks. The system consists of a data stream processing engine, a library of operators for sensor-local processing, a box-and-arrow editor for specifying data mining tasks and deployment, a GUI providing the user with current information about the network and running queries, and an alerter notifying the user if a better query execution plan is available. At the demonstration site, we plan to show our system in action using burst detection as example application.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["National University of Ireland, Galway", "Department of C ... nology, Germany", "Department of C ... nology, Germany", "Department of C ... nology, Germany"], "authors": ["Daniel Klan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klan:Daniel", "Katja Hose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hose:Katja", "Marcel Karnstedt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karnstedt:Marcel", "Kai-Uwe Sattler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sattler:Kai=Uwe"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
