{"title": "Universally Composable Symbolic Analysis for Two-Party Protocols Based on Homomorphic Encryption.", "fields": ["homomorphic encryption", "oblivious transfer", "homomorphic secret sharing", "mathematical proof", "symbolic data analysis"], "abstract": "We consider a class of two-party function evaluation protocols in which the parties are allowed to use ideal functionalities as well as a set of powerful primitives, namely commitments, homomorphic encryption, and certain zero-knowledge proofs. With these it is possible to capture protocols for oblivious transfer, coin-flipping, and generation of multiplication-triples.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Morten Dahl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dahl:Morten", "Ivan Damg\u00e5rd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damg=aring=rd:Ivan"], "pages": 18}
