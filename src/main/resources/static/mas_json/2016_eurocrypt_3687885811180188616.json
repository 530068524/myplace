{"title": "Nonce-Based Cryptography: Retaining Security When Randomness Fails.", "fields": ["symmetric key algorithm", "adversary", "cryptographic nonce", "compromise", "communication source"], "abstract": "We take nonce-based cryptography beyond symmetric encryption, developing it as a broad and practical way to mitigate damage caused by failures in randomness, whether inadvertent bugs or malicious subversion. We focus on definitions and constructions for nonce-based public-key encryption and briefly treat nonce-based signatures. We introduce and construct hedged extractors as a general tool in this domain. Our nonce-based PKE scheme guarantees that if the adversary wants to violate IND-CCA security then it must do both of the following: 1 fully compromise the RNG 2 penetrate the sender system to exfiltrate a seed used by the sender.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Mihir Bellare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellare:Mihir", "Bj\u00f6rn Tackmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tackmann:Bj=ouml=rn"], "pages": 29}
