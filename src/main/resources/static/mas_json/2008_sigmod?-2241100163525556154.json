In this paper, we consider a common resource consolidation scenario, in which several database management system instances, each running in a virtual machine, are sharing a common pool of physical computing resources. We address the problem of optimizing the performance of these database management systems by controlling the configurations of the virtual machines in which they run. These virtual machine configurations determine how the shared physical resources will be allocated to the different database instances. We introduce a virtualization design advisor that uses information about the anticipated workloads of each of the database systems to recommend workload-specific configurations offine. Furthermore, runtime information collected after the deployment of the recommended configurations can be used to refine the recommendation. To estimate the effect of a particular resource allocation on workload performance, we use the query optimizer in a new what-if mode. We have implemented our approach using both PostgreSQL and DB2, and we have experimentally evaluated its effectiveness using DSS and OLTP workloads.", "citation": "Citations (226)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "IBM", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "IBM"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ahmed A.
