To go beyond the limitations of content based appraoches, social network techniques was introduced in the literature to explore the high-level narrative structures by mining the relations between video characters. Taking into account the fact that such a social network is not static but changes over time as the video narrative evolves, in this work, we develop a novel social network model, namely dynamic social network, for capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics in the social network of video characters so as to enable the automatic segmentation of a video into a sequence of narrative scenes. The proposed approach is experimented with various genres of movies and the results demonstrate our effectiveness.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Center for Information Technology", "Center for Information Technology", "Center for Information Technology"], "authors": ["Tsung-Hung Tsai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tsai:Tsung=Hung", "Wen-Huang Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wen=Huang", "Yung-Huan Hsieh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsieh:Yung=Huan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
