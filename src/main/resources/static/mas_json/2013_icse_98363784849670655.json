In such studios, emphasis is placed not only on the artifacts to be produced, but also on the process used to arrive at those artifacts. In this paper, we introduce Calico, a sketch-based collaborative software design tool, and discuss how it supports the delivery of a studio approach to software design education. We particularly describe our experiences with Calico in Software Design I, a course aimed at introducing students to the early, creative phases of software design. Our results show that Calico enabled students to work effectively in teams on their design problems, quickly developing, refining, and evaluating their designs.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Dastyni Loksa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Loksa:Dastyni", "Nicolas Mangano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mangano:Nicolas", "Thomas D.
