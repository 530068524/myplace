Expert developers have long believed that a high design pattern density implies a high maturity of the design under inspection. This paper presents a quantifiable and observable definition of this metric. The metric is illustrated and qualitatively validated using four real-world case studies. We present several hypotheses of the metric's meaning and their implications, including the one about design maturity. We propose that the design pattern density of a maturing framework has a fixed point and we show that if software design patterns make learning frameworks easier, a framework's design pattern density is a measure of how much easier it will become.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["SAP Labs LLC, P ... o Alto, CA, USA"], "conf": "oopsla", "authors": ["Dirk Riehle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riehle:Dirk"], "pages": 12}
