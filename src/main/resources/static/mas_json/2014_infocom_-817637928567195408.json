Recently, research emerges to solve this problem from a pricing point of view. Time dependent pricing has been introduced, and initial investigations have shown its advantages over the conventional time independent pricing. Nevertheless, much is unknown in how a practical and effective time dependent pricing scheme can be designed. In this paper, we explore the design space of time dependent pricing. In particular, we focus on a number of schemes, e.g., the usage-based scheme, the flat-rate scheme, and a mixture of them which we called a cap scheme. Our findings include: 1) the ISP obtains a higher profit with usage-based (or flat-rate) scheme if the capacity is insufficient (or sufficient); 2) the usage-based scheme usually achieves a higher consumer surplus and more efficient traffic utilization than the flat-rate scheme; and 3) the cap scheme is strongly preferred by the ISP to further increase its revenue. We believe our findings provide important insights for ISPs to design effective pricing schemes.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Dept. of Comput ... ong Kong, China", "Dept. of Comput ... ong Kong, China"], "authors": ["Liang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Liang", "Weijie Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Weijie", "Dan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Dan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
