Though extensively studied, most existing algorithms become impractical when the input graph is too large and is disk-resident. We first propose an efficient partition-based algorithm for MCE that addresses the problem of processing large graphs with limited memory. We then further reduce the high cost of CPU computation of MCE by a careful nested partition based on a cost model. Finally, we parallelize our algorithm to further reduce the overall running time. We verified the efficiency of our algorithms by experiments in large real-world graphs.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Institute for I ... pore, Singapore", "Institute of Hi ... pore, Singapore"], "authors": ["James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James", "Linhong Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Linhong", "Yiping Ke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ke:Yiping", "Shumo Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Shumo"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
