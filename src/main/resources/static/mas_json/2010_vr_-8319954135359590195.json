These phenomena have been observed in both computer generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic projection systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for passive and active stereoscopic viewing and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we found that change blindness phenomena occur with the same magnitude as in monoscopic viewing conditions. Furthermore, we have evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of M\u00fcnster", "University of M\u00fcnster", "University of M\u00fcnster", "University of Minnesota"], "authors": ["Frank Steinicke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinicke:Frank", "Gerd Bruder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruder:Gerd", "Klaus H.
