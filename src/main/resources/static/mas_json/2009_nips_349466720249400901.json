{"title": "A Rate Distortion Approach for Semi-Supervised Conditional Random Fields.", "fields": ["conditional mutual information", "conditional entropy", "joint entropy", "structured prediction", "regular conditional probability"], "abstract": "We propose a novel information theoretic approach for semi-supervised learning of conditional random fields that defines a training objective to combine the conditional likelihood on labeled data and the mutual information on unlabeled data. In contrast to previous minimum conditional entropy semi-supervised discriminative learning methods, our approach is grounded on a more solid foundation, the rate distortion theory in information theory. We analyze the tractability of the framework for structured prediction and present a convergent variational training algorithm to defy the combinatorial explosion of terms in the sum over label configurations. Our experimental results show the rate distortion approach outperforms standard l2 regularization, minimum conditional entropy regularization as well as maximum conditional entropy regularization on both multi-class classification and sequence labeling problems.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Wright State University", "Wright State University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Yang", "Gholamreza Haffari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haffari:Gholamreza", "Shaojun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Shaojun", "Greg Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Greg"], "pages": 9}
