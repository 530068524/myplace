By combining a supervised large margin loss with an unsupervised least squares loss, a discriminative, convex, semi-supervised learning algorithm can be obtained that is applicable to large-scale problems. To demonstrate the benefits of this approach, we apply the technique to learning dependency parsers from combined labeled and unlabeled corpora. Using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, a parsing model can be efficiently learned from semi-supervised data that significantly outperforms corresponding supervised methods.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Google"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Qin Iris Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qin_Iris", "Dale Schuurmans.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuurmans:Dale", "Dekang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Dekang"], "pages": 9}
