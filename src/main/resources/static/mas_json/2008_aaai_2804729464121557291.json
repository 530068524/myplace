{"title": "Transferring Localization Models across Space.", "fields": ["semi supervised learning", "labeled data", "manifold", "nonlinear dimensionality reduction", "online machine learning"], "abstract": "Machine learning approaches to indoor WiFi localization involve an offline phase and an online phase. In the offline phase, data are collected from an environment to build a localization model, which will be applied to new data collected in the online phase for location estimation. However, collecting the labeled data across an entire building would be too time consuming. In this paper, we present a novel approach to transferring the learning model trained on data from one area of a building to another. We learn a mapping function between the signal space and the location space by solving an optimization problem based on manifold learning techniques. A low-dimensional manifold is shared between data collected in different areas in an environment as a bridge to propagate the knowledge across the whole environment. With the help of the transferred knowledge, we can significantly reduce the amount of labeled data which are required for building the localization model. We test the effectiveness of our proposed solution in a real indoor WiFi environment.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Microsoft", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Sinno Jialin Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Sinno_Jialin", "Dou Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Dou", "Qiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Qiang", "James T.
