We resort to the multi-commodity flow (MCF) formulation, augmented with the conflict-graph constraints, to jointly compute the maximum throughput and the associated optimal network dimensioning; while use a novel approach to take into account the collision overhead in the distributed CSMA/CA MAC. Such overhead has been ignored by the existing MCF-based capacity studies, which assume impractical centralized scheduling and result in aggressive network dimensioning, unachievable over the CSMA/CA MAC. We develop a generic method to integrate the CSMA/CA MAC analysis with the MCF formulation for optimal network capacity analysis, and derive both an upper bound and a lower bound of the network throughput over a practical CSMA/CA protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first rigorous theoretical study of the achievable capacity over a multi-hop CSMA/CA based wireless network.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Yu Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng_0003:Yu", "Hongkun Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongkun", "Peng-Jun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan:Peng=Jun", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
