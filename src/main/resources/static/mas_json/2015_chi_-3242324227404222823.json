{"title": "Dynamic Opacity Optimization for Scatter Plots.", "fields": ["data point", "data set", "scatter plot", "opacity", "chart"], "abstract": "Scatterplots are an effective and commonly used technique to show the relationship between two variables. However, as the number of data points increases, the chart suffers from \"over-plotting\" which obscures data points and makes the underlying distribution of the data difficult to discern. Reducing the opacity of the data points is an effective way to address over-plotting, however, setting the individual point opacity is a manual task performed by the chart designer. We present a user-driven model of opacity scaling for scatter plots built from crowd-sourced responses to opacity scaling tasks using several synthetic data distributions, and then test our model on a collection of real-world data sets.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Autodesk", "University of Alberta", "Autodesk"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Justin Matejka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matejka:Justin", "Fraser Anderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anderson:Fraser", "George W.
