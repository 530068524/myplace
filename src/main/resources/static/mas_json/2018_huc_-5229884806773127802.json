The method of transmitting messages, skin-reading, is effective at conveying rich information but its active training method requires full user attention, is demanding, time-consuming, and tedious. Passive haptic learning offers the possibility to learn in the background while performing another primary task. We present a study investigating the use of passive haptic learning to train for skin-reading.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Know-Center, Graz, Austria", "Know-Center, Graz, Austria"], "authors": ["Granit Luzhnica.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luzhnica:Granit", "Eduardo E.
