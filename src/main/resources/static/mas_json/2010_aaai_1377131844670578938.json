In this paper, we show that several advantages can be gained by utilizing another type of automata, the Mealy machine. Mealy machines are more powerful than Moore machines, provide a richer structure that can be exploited by solution methods, and can be easily incorporated into current controller-based approaches. To demonstrate this, we adapted some existing controller-based algorithms to use Mealy machines and obtained results on a set of benchmark domains. The Mealy-based approach always outperformed the Moore-based approach and often outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms for both centralized and decentralized POMDPs. These findings provide fresh and general insights for the improvement of existing algorithms and the development of new ones.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Christopher Amato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amato:Christopher", "Blai Bonet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bonet:Blai", "Shlomo Zilberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zilberstein:Shlomo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
