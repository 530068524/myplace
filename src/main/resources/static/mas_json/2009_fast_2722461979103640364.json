In science, medicine, commerce, and government, data provenance tracking is essential for rights protection, regulatory compliance, management of intelligence and medical data, and authentication of information as it flows through workplace tasks. In this paper, we show how to provide strong integrity and confidentiality assurances for data provenance information. We describe our provenance-aware system prototype that implements provenance tracking of data writes at the application layer, which makes it extremely easy to deploy. We present empirical results that show that, for typical real-life workloads, the run-time overhead of our approach to recording provenance with confidentiality and integrity guarantees ranges from 1%-13%.", "citation": "Citations (254)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Stony Brook University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Ragib Hasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasan:Ragib", "Radu Sion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sion:Radu", "Marianne Winslett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winslett:Marianne"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2009", "pages": 14}
