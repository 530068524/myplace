In this paper, we describe findings from a study of 25 cars and drivers, examining the objects present in the car cabin, the reasons for them being there, and driver awareness of the potential dangers of these objects. With an average of 4.3 potentially dangerous loose objects in a car's cabin, our findings suggest that despite being generally aware of potential risks, considerations of convenience, easy access, and lack of in-the-moment awareness lead people to continue to place objects in dangerous locations in cars. Our study highlights opportunities for addressing this problem by tracking and reminding people about loose objects in cars.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Intel", "University of California, Irvine", "Intel"], "authors": ["Daniel Avrahami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avrahami:Daniel", "Michael T.
