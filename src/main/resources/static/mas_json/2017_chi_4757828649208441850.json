{"title": "Facilitating Development of Pragmatic Competence through a Voice-driven Video Learning Interface.", "fields": ["correctness", "natural language processing", "utterance", "foreign language", "language acquisition"], "abstract": "Authentic foreign language videos are effective for developing pragmatic competence, or sensitivity to meanings expressed by tone and word choice, and the ability to effectively express these meanings. However, established methods for learning from foreign language videos are primarily text-based (e.g.captioning). Using text, learners do not practice aspects of oral performance (e.g. intonation, pausing, and pitch) that are important to pragmatic competence. In this paper we present a voice-driven system where learners practice and learn a foreign language by repeating phrases out loud from any video. Utterances are transcribed and translated and, if captions are available, the system indicates the correctness of the utterance. In an evaluation with 27 participants, we show that participants more frequently used the voice-driven system than a comparison text-based system. Furthermore, ina field study of 130 independent learners, we show potential for community-driven resource collection.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Gabriel Culbertson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Culbertson:Gabriel", "Solace Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Solace", "Malte F.
