That is, there exists a limiting density \u03b1 s (k) such that a random k-SAT formula of clause density \u03b1 is with high probability satisfiable for \u03b1  s , and unsatisfiable for \u03b1 > \u03b1 s . The satisfiability threshold \u03b1 s  is given explicitly by the one-step replica symmetry breaking (1SRB) prediction from statistical physics. We believe that our methods may apply to a range of random constraint satisfaction problems in the 1RSB class.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of California, Berkeley", "Microsoft"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Jian Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Jian", "Allan Sly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sly:Allan", "Nike Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Nike"], "pages": 10}
