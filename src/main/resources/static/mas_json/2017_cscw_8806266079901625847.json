{"title": "Parental Control vs. Teen Self-Regulation: Is there a middle ground for mobile online safety?", "fields": ["android", "pattern recognition", "value sensitive design", "conceptual framework", "family values"], "abstract": "We conducted a structured, qualitative feature analysis of 75 Android mobile apps designed for the purpose of promoting adolescent online safety. Through this analysis we identified 42 unique features that mapped to a theoretically derived conceptual framework of teen online safety strategies balanced between parental control strategies (through monitoring, restriction, and active mediation) and teen self-regulation strategies (through self-monitoring, impulse control, and risk-coping). We found that the apps strongly favored features that promote parental control through monitoring and restricting teens' online behaviors over teen self-regulation or more communicative and collaborative practices between parents and teens. We use the lens of value sensitive design to discuss the implications of our results and identify opportunities for designing mobile apps for online safety that embed more positive family values.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Pamela J.
