The ( b  1 ,  b  2 )-approximate Braun-Blanquet similarity search problem is to preprocess a collection of sets  P  such that, given a query set  q , if there exists  x  \u00e2    P  with  B ( q ,  x ) \u00e2 \ufffd  b  1 , then we can efficiently return  x \u00e2 \ufffd \u00e2    P  with  B ( q ,  x \u00e2 \ufffd) >  b  2 .   We present a simple data structure that solves this problem with space usage  O ( n  1+\ufffd  log n  + \u00e2    x  \u00e2    P  | x |) and query time  O (| q | n  \ufffd   log n ) where  n  = | P | and \ufffd  = log(1/ b  1 )/log(1/ b  2 ). Making use of existing lower bounds for locality-sensitive hashing by O\u00e2  Donnell et al. (TOCT 2014) we show that this value of \ufffd  is tight across the parameter space, i.e., for every choice of constants 0  b  2   b  1    In the case where all sets have the same size our solution strictly improves upon the value of \ufffd  that can be obtained through the use of state-of-the-art data-independent techniques in the Indyk-Motwani locality-sensitive hashing framework (STOC 1998) such as Broder\u00e2  s MinHash (CCS 1997) for Jaccard similarity and Andoni et al.\u00e2  s cross-polytope LSH (NIPS 2015) for cosine similarity. Surprisingly, even though our solution is data-independent, for a large part of the parameter space we outperform the currently best data- dependent  method by Andoni and Razenshteyn (STOC 2015).", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Tobias Christiani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Christiani:Tobias", "Rasmus Pagh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pagh:Rasmus"], "pages": 14}
