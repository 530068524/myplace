We characterize the complexity of the problem and introduce sample allocation strategies that pull arms to identify the best arm with a fixed confidence, while minimizing the sample budget. In particular, we show the importance of exploiting the global linear structure to improve the estimate of the reward of near-optimal arms. We analyze the proposed strategies and compare their empirical performance. Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we point out the connection to the G-optimality criterion used in optimal experimental design.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Marta Soare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soare:Marta", "Alessandro Lazaric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lazaric:Alessandro", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi"], "pages": 9}
