Consequently, their parallel construction is an actively studied problem. To date, algorithms with best practical performance lack efficient worst-case run-time guarantees, and vice versa. In addition, much of the recent work targeted low core count, shared memory parallelization. In this paper, we present parallel algorithms for distributed memory construction of suffix arrays and longest common prefix (LCP) arrays that simultaneously achieve good worst-case run-time bounds and superior practical performance. Our algorithms run in  O ( T   sort  ( n, p ) \u00b7 log  n ) worst-case time where  T   sort  ( n, p ) is the run-time of parallel sorting. We present several algorithm engineering techniques that improve performance in practice. We demonstrate the construction of suffix and LCP arrays of the human genome in less than 8 seconds on 1,024 Intel Xeon cores, reaching speedups of over 110X compared to the best sequential suffix array construction implementation  divsufsort.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Patrick Flick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flick:Patrick", "Srinivas Aluru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aluru:Srinivas"], "pages": 10}
