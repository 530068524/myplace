{"title": "Planning with Multi-Valued Landmarks.", "fields": ["heuristics", "cardinality", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Landmark heuristics are perhaps the most accurate current known admissible heuristics for optimal planning. A disjunctive action landmark can be seen a form of at-least-one constraint on the actions it contains. In many domains, some critical propositions have to be established for a number of times. Propositional landmarks are too weak to express this kind of constraints. In this paper, we propose to generalize landmarks to multi-valued landmarks to represent the more general cardinality constraints. We present a class of local multi-valued landmarks that can be efficiently extracted from propositional landmarks. By encoding multi-valued landmarks into CNF formulas, we can also use SAT solvers to systematically extract multivalued landmarks. Experiment evaluations show that multivalued landmark based heuristics are more close to h* and compete favorably with the state-of-the-art of admissible landmark heuristics on benchmark domains.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Lei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lei", "Chong-Jun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Chong=Jun", "Jun Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Jun", "Meilin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Meilin", "Jun-Yuan Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Jun=Yuan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
