{"title": "Text-level Discourse Parsing with Rich Linguistic Features.", "fields": ["natural language processing", "top down parsing", "bottom up parsing", "s attributed grammar", "parsing"], "abstract": "In this paper, we develop an RST-style text-level discourse parser, based on the HILDA discourse parser (Hernault et al., 2010b). We significantly improve its tree-building step by incorporating our own rich linguistic features. We also analyze the difficulty of extending traditional sentence-level discourse parsing to text-level parsing by comparing discourse-parsing performance under different discourse conditions.", "citation": "Citations (131)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Vanessa Wei Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Vanessa_Wei", "Graeme Hirst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirst:Graeme"], "pages": 9}
