The complexity of reliability analysis of safety critical PLC systems arises in handling the temporal correlations among the system components caused by the run-time execution logic of the embedded ladder program. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model for the reliability analysis of PLC systems, called run-time reliability model (RRM). It is constructed based on the structure and run-time execution of the embedded ladder program, automatically. Then, we present some custom-made conditional probability distribution (CPD) tables according to the execution semantics of the RRM nodes, and insert the reliability probability of each system component referenced by the node into the corresponding CPD table. The proposed model is accurate and fast compared to previous work as described in the experiment results.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Portland State University", "Portland State University", "Chinese Ministry of Education"], "authors": ["Yu Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0001:Yu", "Hehua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hehua", "Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Han", "Xiaoyu Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Xiaoyu", "William N.
