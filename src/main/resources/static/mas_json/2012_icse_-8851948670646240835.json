In this paper we outline the characteristics of an existing global software development course run over a period of nine years, and present a flexible project framework for conducting student projects in a distributed environment. Based on data collected from fourteen distributed student projects, a set of collaboration patterns is identified and their causes and implications described. Collaboration patterns are a result of the analysis of collaboration links within distributed student teams, and can assist teachers in better understanding of the dynamics found in distributed projects.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Zagreb", "University of Zagreb", "M\u00e4lardalen University College"], "authors": ["Tobias Roehm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roehm:Tobias", "Walid Maalej.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maalej:Walid"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
