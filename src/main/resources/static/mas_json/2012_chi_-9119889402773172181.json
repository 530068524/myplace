However, reducing electricity use can be difficult with only a meter and a monthly or annual electricity bill. With the emergence of new power meters units, information on electricity consumption is now available digitally and wirelessly. This enables the design and deployment of a new class of persuasive systems giving consumers insight into their use of energy resources and means for reducing it. In this paper, we explore the design and use of one such system, Power Advisor, promoting electricity conservation through tailored information on a mobile phone or tablet. The use of the system in 10 households was studied over 7 weeks. Findings provide insight into peoples awareness of electricity consumption in their home and how this may be influenced through design.", "citation": "Citations (83)", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University"], "authors": ["Jesper Kjeldskov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kjeldskov:Jesper", "Mikael B.
