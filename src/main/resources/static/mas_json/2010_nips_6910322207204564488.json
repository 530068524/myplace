{"title": "Multitask Learning without Label Correspondences.", "fields": ["mutual information", "machine learning", "existential quantification", "artificial intelligence", "oracle", "pattern recognition", "multi task learning", "data integration", "computer science"], "abstract": "We propose an algorithm to perform multitask learning where each task has potentially distinct label sets and label correspondences are not readily available. This is in contrast with existing methods which either assume that the label sets shared by different tasks are the same or that there exists a label mapping oracle. Our method directly maximizes the mutual information among the labels, and we show that the resulting objective function can be efficiently optimized using existing algorithms. Our proposed approach has a direct application for data integration with different label spaces, such as integrating Yahoo! and DMOZ web directories.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["NICTA", "NICTA", "NICTA", "Yahoo!", "Purdue University", "NICTA", "Yahoo!", "Australian National University", "Purdue University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Novi Quadrianto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quadrianto:Novi", "Alexander J.
