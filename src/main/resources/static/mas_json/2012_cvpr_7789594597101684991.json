{"title": "Social behavior recognition in continuous video.", "fields": ["benchmark", "computer vision", "discriminative model", "image segmentation", "context model"], "abstract": "We present a novel method for analyzing social behavior. Continuous videos are segmented into action \u2018bouts\u2019 by building a temporal context model that combines features from spatio-temporal energy and agent trajectories. The method is tested on an unprecedented dataset of videos of interacting pairs of mice, which was collected as part of a state-of-the-art neurophysiological study of behavior. The dataset comprises over 88 hours (8 million frames) of annotated videos. We find that our novel trajectory features, used in a discriminative framework, are more informative than widely used spatio-temporal features; furthermore, temporal context plays an important role for action recognition in continuous videos. Our approach may be seen as a baseline method on this dataset, reaching a mean recognition rate of 61.2% compared to the expert's agreement rate of about 70%.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "Microsoft", "New York University", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xavier P.
