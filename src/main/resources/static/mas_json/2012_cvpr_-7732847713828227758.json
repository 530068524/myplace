Aiming at capturing full-frame depth for dynamic scenes at a minimum of three lighting conditions, we formulate an iterative optimization scheme that (1) adaptively adjusts the contribution from photometric stereo so that discontinuity can be preserved; (2) detects shadow areas by checking the visibility of the estimated point with respect to the light source, instead of using image-based heuristics; and (3) behaves well for ill-conditioned pixels that are under shadow, which are inevitable in almost any scene. Furthermore, we decompose our non-linear cost function into subproblems that can be optimized efficiently using linear techniques. Experiments show significantly improved results over the previous state-of-the-art in sensor fusion.", "citation": "Citations (36)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Kentucky", "University of Kentucky", "University of Kentucky", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Qing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qing", "Mao Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Mao", "Ruigang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Ruigang", "Yasuyuki Matsushita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsushita:Yasuyuki", "Bennett Wilburn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilburn:Bennett", "Huimin Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Huimin"], "pages": 8}
