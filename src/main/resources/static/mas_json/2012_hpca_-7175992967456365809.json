{"title": "MORSE: Multi-objective reconfigurable self-optimizing memory scheduler.", "fields": ["scheduling", "efficient energy use", "figure of merit", "throughput", "morse code"], "abstract": "We propose a systematic and general approach to designing self-optimizing memory schedulers that can target arbitrary figures of merit (e.g., performance, throughput, energy, fairness). Using our framework, we instantiate three memory schedulers that target three important metrics: performance and energy efficiency of parallel workloads, as well as throughput/fairness of multiprogrammed workloads. Our experiments show that the resulting hardware significantly outperforms the state of the art in all cases.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Janani Mukundan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukundan:Janani", "Jos\u00e9 F.
