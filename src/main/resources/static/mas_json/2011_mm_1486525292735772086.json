In this paper, we present a location-aware system that helps technical directors in the broadcasting task, using a 3D model updated continuously with real-time location data retrieved from the scenario. They can indicate in run-time their interest in certain moving objects and the system is in charge of selecting the cameras that provide the kind of views required.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Zaragoza", "University of Zaragoza", "University of Zaragoza", "University of Zaragoza", "Basque Country  ... ebasti\u00e1n, Spain"], "authors": ["Roberto Yus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yus:Roberto", "Eduardo Mena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mena:Eduardo", "Jorge Bernad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bernad:Jorge", "Sergio Ilarri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilarri:Sergio", "Arantza Illarramendi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Illarramendi:Arantza"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
