Our technique is based on joint global motion estimation and multi-frame deblurring. It also automatically computes the duty cycle of the video, namely the percentage of time between frames that is actually exposure time. The duty cycle is necessary for allowing the blur kernels to be accurately extracted and then removed. We demonstrate our technique on a number of videos.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "Cornell University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yunpeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yunpeng", "Sing Bing Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Sing_Bing", "Neel Joshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joshi:Neel", "Steven M.
