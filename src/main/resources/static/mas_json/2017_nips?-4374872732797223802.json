RPFB is a set of randomly generated stable autoregressive filters that are convolved with the input time series to generate the features. These features can be used by any conventional machine learning algorithm for solving tasks such as time series prediction, classification with time series data, etc. Different filters in RPFB extract different aspects of the time series, and together they provide a reasonably good summary of the time series. RPFB is easy to implement, fast to compute, and parallelizable. We provide an error upper bound indicating that RPFB provides a reasonable approximation to a class of dynamical systems. The empirical results in a series of synthetic and real-world problems show that RPFB is an effective method to extract features from time series.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["MERL", "MERL"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Amir-massoud Farahmand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farahmand:Amir=massoud", "Sepideh Pourazarm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pourazarm:Sepideh", "Daniel Nikovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikovski:Daniel"], "pages": 11}
