This imposes constraints on the matrix elements which allow for estimation of missing entries. A lower rank provides stronger constraints and makes estimation of the missing entries less ambiguous at the cost of measurement fit. In this paper we propose a new factorization model that further constrains the matrix entries. Our approach can be seen as a unification of traditional low-rank matrix factorization and the more recent union-of-subspace approach. It adaptively finds clusters that can be modeled with low dimensional local subspaces and simultaneously uses a global rank constraint to capture the overall scene interactions. For inference we use an energy that penalizes a trade-off between data fit and degrees-of-freedom of the resulting factorization. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that regularizing both local and global dynamics yields significantly improved missing data estimation.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Lund University", "Chalmers University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Viktor Larsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsson:Viktor", "Carl Olsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olsson:Carl"], "pages": 10}
