Unfortunately, writing a PPL program by hand can be difficult for non-experts, requiring extensive knowledge of statistics and deep insights into the data. To make the modeling process easier, we have created a tool that synthesizes PPL programs from relational datasets. Our synthesizer leverages the input data to generate a program sketch, then applies simulated annealing to complete the sketch. We introduce a data-guided approach to the program mutation stage of simulated annealing; this innovation allows our tool to scale to synthesizing complete probabilistic programs from scratch. We find that our synthesizer produces accurate programs from 10,000-row datasets in 21 s on average.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Sarah Chasins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chasins:Sarah", "Phitchaya Mangpo Phothilimthana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phothilimthana:Phitchaya_Mangpo"], "pages": 26}
