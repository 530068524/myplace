Aimed to optimize the browsing experience, extensive previous research has been carried out on users' revisitation behavior. However, the conventional definition for revisitation, which only considers page loading activities by monitoring http requests initiated by the browser, largely underestimates users' intended revisitation activities with  tabbed browsers . Thus, we introduce a goal-oriented definition and a refined revisitation measurement based on page viewings in tabbed browsers. An empirical analysis of statistics taken from a client-side log study showed that although the overall revisitation rate remained relatively constant, tabbed browsing has introduced new behaviors warrant future investigations.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Haimo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Haimo", "Shengdong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shengdong"], "pages": 4}
