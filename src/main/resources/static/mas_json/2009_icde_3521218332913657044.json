{"title": "SbQA: A Self-Adaptable Query Allocation Process.", "fields": ["data mining", "web query classification", "information system", "resource management", "load balancing"], "abstract": "We present a flexible query allocation framework, called Satisfaction-based Query Allocation (SbQA for short), for distributed information systems where both consumers and providers (the participants) have special interests towards queries. A particularity of SbQA is that it allocates queries while considering both query load and participants' interests. To be fair, it dynamically trades consumers' interests for providers' interests based on their satisfaction. In this demo we illustrate the flexibility and efficiency of SbQA to allocate queries on the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). We also demonstrate that SbQA is self-adaptable to the participants' expectations. Finally, we demonstrate that SbQA can be adapted to different kinds of applications by varying its parameters.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Jorge-Arnulfo Quian\u00e9-Ruiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quian=eacute==Ruiz:Jorge=Arnulfo", "Philippe Lamarre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lamarre:Philippe", "Patrick Valduriez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valduriez:Patrick"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
