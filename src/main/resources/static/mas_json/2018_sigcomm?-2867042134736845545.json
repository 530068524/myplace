{"title": "Microboxes: high performance NFV with customizable, asynchronous TCP stacks and dynamic subscriptions.", "fields": ["network packet", "protocol stack", "network service", "stack", "middlebox"], "abstract": "Existing network service chaining frameworks are based on a \"packet-centric\" model where each NF in a chain is given every packet for processing. This approach becomes both inefficient and inconvenient for more complex network functions that operate at higher levels of the protocol stack. We propose Microboxes, a novel service chaining abstraction designed to support transport- and application-layer middle-boxes, or even end-system like services. Simply including a TCP stack in an NFV platform is insufficient because there is a wide spectrum of middlebox types-from NFs requiring only simple TCP bytestream reconstruction to full endpoint termination. By exposing a publish/subscribe-based API for NFs to access packets or protocol events as needed, Microboxes eliminates redundant processing across a chain and enables a modular design. Our implementation on a DPDK-based NFV framework can double throughput by consolidating stack operations and provide a 51% throughput gain by customizing TCP processing to the appropriate level.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["George Washington University", "George Washington University", "George Washington University", "University of California, Riverside", "George Washington University"], "conf": "sigcomm", "authors": ["Guyue Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Guyue", "Yuxin Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Yuxin", "Mykola Yurchenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yurchenko:Mykola", "K.
