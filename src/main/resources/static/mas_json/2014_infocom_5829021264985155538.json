However, finding the critical condition to achieve full view coverage in mobile heterogeneous CSNs remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze both the static and mobile random deployed camera sensor networks. A centralized parameter - equivalent sensing radius (ESR) - is defined to evaluate the critical requirement for asymptotic full view coverage in heterogeneous CSNs. We derive the critical sensing range for full view coverage under static model, 2-dimensional random walk mobility model, 1- dimensional random walk mobility model and random rotating model. We then discuss the impact of various mobility patterns on sensing energy consumption and study the relationship between ESR and percentage of full view coverage, and show that random walk mobility model can decrease the sensing energy consumption under certain delay tolerance. To our knowledge, our work is the very first that derive the critical condition to achieve full view coverage in mobile heterogeneous CSNs.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Yitao Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yitao", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing", "Xiaoying Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Xiaoying"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
