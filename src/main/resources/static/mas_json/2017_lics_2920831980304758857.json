The second conjecture, challenging the approach via model-complete cores by reflections, states that tractability is equivalent to the linear identities (without outer embeddings) satisfied by its polymorphisms clone, together with the natural uniformity on it, being non-trivial.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Charles University in Prague", "Vienna University of Technology", "Charles University in Prague", "Vienna University of Technology", "Charles University in Prague"], "authors": ["Libor Barto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barto:Libor", "Michael Kompatscher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kompatscher:Michael", "Miroslav Ols\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ols=aacute=k:Miroslav", "Trung Van Pham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pham:Trung_Van", "Michael Pinsker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pinsker:Michael"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
