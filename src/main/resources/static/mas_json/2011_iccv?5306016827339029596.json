The system is composed of a machine and a human user. The user, who is unable to carry out the recognition task by himself, is interactively asked to provide two heterogeneous forms of information: clicking on object parts and answering binary questions. The machine intelligently selects the most informative question to pose to the user in order to identify the object's class as quickly as possible. By leveraging computer vision and analyzing the user responses, the overall amount of human effort required, measured in seconds, is minimized. We demonstrate promising results on a challenging dataset of uncropped images, achieving a significant average reduction in human effort over previous methods.", "citation": "Citations (153)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Catherine Wah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wah:Catherine", "Steve Branson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Branson:Steve", "Pietro Perona.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perona:Pietro", "Serge J.
