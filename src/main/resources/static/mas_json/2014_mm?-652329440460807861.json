{"title": "Gone: an interactive experience for two people.", "fields": ["multimedia", "social group", "computer science", "game art design", "simulation"], "abstract": "In this paper we present a multimedia art installation which uses human computer interaction to give the user the possibility to experience how blind people perceive the world and how hard it can be. The installation follows the classical co-operative game pattern, where a group of people - in this case two - have to work together to achieve a goal. With these basic characteristics in mind we consider our submission a serious game. With this serious game we show how multimedia can be used for making people more attentive for problems of other people and that multimedia, and in this case serious games, are indeed a useful tool for letting people experience situations they have not been aware of before.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Simula Research Laboratory", "Klagenfurt Univ ... enfurt, Austria", "Klagenfurt Univ ... enfurt, Austria", "Klagenfurt Univ ... enfurt, Austria", "Klangkulisse e. ... , Graz, Austria"], "authors": ["Michael Riegler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riegler:Michael", "Mathias Lux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lux:Mathias", "Christian Zellot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zellot:Christian", "Lukas Knoch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knoch:Lukas", "Horst Schnattler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schnattler:Horst", "Sabrina Napetschnig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Napetschnig:Sabrina", "Julian Kogler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kogler:Julian", "Claus Degendorfer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Degendorfer:Claus", "Norbert Spot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spot:Norbert", "Manuel Zoderer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zoderer:Manuel"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 4}
