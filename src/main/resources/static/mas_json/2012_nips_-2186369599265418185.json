{"title": "Minimizing Uncertainty in Pipelines.", "fields": ["operator", "debugging", "theoretical computer science", "directed acyclic graph", "graph"], "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of debugging large pipelines by human labeling. We represent the execution of a pipeline using a directed acyclic graph of AND and OR nodes, where each node represents a data item produced by some operator in the pipeline. We assume that each operator assigns a confidence to each of its output data. We want to reduce the uncertainty in the output by issuing queries to a human, where a query consists of checking if a given data item is correct. In this paper, we consider the problem of asking the optimal set of queries to minimize the resulting output uncertainty. We perform a detailed evaluation of the complexity of the problem for various classes of graphs. We give efficient algorithms for the problem for trees, and show that, for a general dag, the problem is intractable.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Facebook", "Stanford University", "Google"], "authors": ["Nilesh N.
