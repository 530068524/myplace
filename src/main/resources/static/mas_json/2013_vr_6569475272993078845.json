The present study focuses on three major aspects identified in literature that would help customize the virtual audience for fear of public speaking applications: interaction, group dynamics, and personalization. Eight experts from VR-related fields of study have been interviewed to share the expertise on how to achieve and implement these aspects.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ilmenau Univers ...  & Media Design", "Ilmenau Univers ...  & Media Design", "Ilmenau Univers ...  & Media Design"], "authors": ["Ana-Despina Tudor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tudor:Ana=Despina", "Sandra Poeschl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poeschl:Sandra", "Nicola Doering.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doering:Nicola"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
