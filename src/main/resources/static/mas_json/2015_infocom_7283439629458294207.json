We consider a single source that communicates to a single destination assisted by several relays through multiple-hops. At each hop, only one node transmits, while the rest of nodes receive the transmitted signal, and store it after processing/decoding and mixing with the signals received in previous hops. This is, we consider that terminals make use of advanced energy accumulation transmission/reception techniques such us maximal ratio combining reception of repetition codes, or information accumulation with rateless codes. Accumulative techniques increase communication reliability, reduce energy consumption, and decrease latency. We investigate the properties that a routing metric must satisfy in these accumulative networks to guarantee that optimal paths can be computed with Dijkstra's algorithm. We model the problem of routing in an accumulative multi-hop networks, as the problem of routing in a hypergraph. We show that optimality properties in traditional multi-hop network (monotonicity and isotonicity) are no longer valid and derive a new set of sufficient conditions for optimality.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Centre Tecnol\u00f2g ... lldefels, Spain", "Centre Tecnol\u00f2g ... arcelona, Spain"], "authors": ["Jes\u00fas G\u00f3mez-Vilardeb\u00f3.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=oacute=mez=Vilardeb=oacute=:Jes=uacute=s"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 8}
