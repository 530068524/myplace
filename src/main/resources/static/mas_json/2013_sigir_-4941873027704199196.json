During a session, users often change queries to explore and investigate the information needs. In this paper, we propose to use query change as a new form of relevance feedback for better session search. Evaluation conducted over TREC 2012 Session Track shows that query change is a highly effective form of feedback as compared with existing relevance feedback methods. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art relevance feedback methods for the TREC 2012 Session Track by a significant improvement of >25%.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Georgetown University", "Georgetown University", "Georgetown University"], "authors": ["Sicong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Sicong", "Dongyi Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Dongyi", "Hui Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Hui"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
