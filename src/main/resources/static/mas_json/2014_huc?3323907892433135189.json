This paper reveals a principled pitfall in previous studies. Most of these studies have used average reduction of response delays as the metric for responsiveness. Through a systematic user study and statistical analysis, this paper shows that the metric fails to faithfully reflect user experienced responsiveness. To avoid the pitfall, a straight-forward solution is to employ users' direct feedback as the responsiveness metric, which is unfortunately hard to obtain. This paper presents the promise of solving the dilemma through a SatScore model. It further demonstrates some new opportunities for responsiveness enhancement enabled by the SatScore model.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["College of William & Mary", "College of William & Mary", "North Carolina State University"], "authors": ["Zhijia Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Zhijia", "Mingzhou Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Mingzhou", "Xipeng Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xipeng"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
