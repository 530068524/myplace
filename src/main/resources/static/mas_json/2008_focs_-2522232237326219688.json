A notorious question has been whether the existence of a short proof implies the existence of a proof that can be verified using limited space.In this paper we resolve the question by answering it negatively in the strongest possible way. We show that there are families of 6-CNF formulas of size n, for arbitrarily large n, that have resolution proofs of length O(n) but for which any proof requires space Omega(n/log n). This is the strongest asymptotic separation possible since any proof of length O(n) can always be transformed into a proof in space O(n / log n).Our result follows by reducing the space complexity of so called pebbling formulas over a directed acyclic graph to the black-white pebbling price of the graph.The proof is somewhat simpler than previous results (in particular, those reported in [Nordstrom 2006, Nordstrom and Hastad 2008]) as it uses a slightly different flavor of pebbling formulas which allows for a rather straightforward reduction of proof space to standard black-white pebbling price.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Sch. of Comput. ... nol., Stockholm"], "authors": ["Eli Ben-Sasson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Sasson:Eli", "Jakob Nordstr\u00f6m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nordstr=ouml=m:Jakob"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
