Such object set leads to new challenges in modeling information contained in data, defining appropriate criteria for selecting objects, and in devising efficient algorithms for such a selection. We propose a framework that models objects as a set of the corresponding information units and reduces the ummarization problem to that of optimizing probabilistic coverage. To solve the resulting NP-hard problem, we develop a highly efficient greedy algorithm, which gains its efficiency by leveraging object-level and iteration-level optimization. A comprehensive empirical evaluation over three real datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline techniques in terms of quality and also scales very well against the size of dataset.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jie Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jie", "Dmitri V.
