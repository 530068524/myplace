However, these works require specialized hardware not commonly available, limiting the adoption of such technologies. We present SymmetriSense, a technology enabling near-surface 3-dimensional fingertip localization above arbitrary glossy surfaces using a single commodity camera device such as a smartphone. SymmetriSense addresses the localization challenges in using a single regular camera by a novel technique utilizing the principle of reflection symmetry and the fingertip's natural reflection casted upon surfaces like mirrors, granite countertops, or televisions. SymmetriSense achieves typical accuracies at sub-centimeter levels in our localization tests with dozens of volunteers and remains accurate under various environmental conditions. We hope SymmetriSense provides a technical foundation on which various everyday near-surface interactivity can be designed.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["KAIST", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Chungkuk Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Chungkuk", "Inseok Hwang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hwang:Inseok", "Eric Rozner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rozner:Eric", "Yu Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu_0001:Yu", "Robert F.
