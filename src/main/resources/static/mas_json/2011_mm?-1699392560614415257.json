{"title": "APRICOD: a distributed caching middleware for fast content discovery of non-continuous media access.", "fields": ["scalability", "peer to peer", "middleware", "teleportation", "hop"], "abstract": "We propose an access pattern-driven distributed caching middleware named APRICOD, which can be built on top of any existing content discovery system. APRICOD caters for fast and scalable content discovery in peer-to-peer media streaming systems, especially when user interactions that leads to non-continuous media access (such as random seek in video and teleportation in virtual environment) are present. APRICOD caches query results based correlations among media objects accessed by users, reducing the content discovery time. Our evaluation using a VoD access trace shows that close to 70% of non-continuous access queries can be resolved with a single hop using APRICOD.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Zhen Wei Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zhen_Wei", "Wei Tsang Ooi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ooi:Wei_Tsang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
