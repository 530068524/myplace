A key advantage of the method is that it avoids projections - the computational bottleneck in many applications - replacing it by a linear optimization step. Despite this advantage, the known convergence rates of the FW method fall behind standard first order methods for most settings of interest. It is an active line of research to derive faster linear optimization-based algorithms for various settings of convex optimization.\n\nIn this paper we consider the special case of optimization over strongly convex sets, for which we prove that the vanila FW method converges at a rate of 1/t2. This gives a quadratic improvement in convergence rate compared to the general case, in which convergence is of the order 1/t, and known to be tight. We show that various balls induced by lp norms, Schatten norms and group norms are strongly convex on one hand and on the other hand, linear optimization over these sets is straightforward and admits a closed-form solution. We further show how several previous fastrate results for the FW method follow easily from our analysis.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Princeton University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Dan Garber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garber:Dan", "Elad Hazan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazan:Elad"], "pages": 9}
