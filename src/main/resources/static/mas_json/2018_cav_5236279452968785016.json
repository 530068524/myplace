{"title": "Counterexample Guided Inductive Synthesis Modulo Theories.", "fields": ["counterexample", "program synthesis", "solver", "modulo", "variable elimination"], "abstract": "Program synthesis is the mechanised construction of software. One of the main difficulties is the efficient exploration of the very large solution space, and tools often require a user-provided syntactic restriction of the search space. We propose a new approach to program synthesis that combines the strengths of a counterexample-guided inductive synthesizer with those of a theory solver, exploring the solution space more efficiently without relying on user guidance. We call this approach CEGIS(\\(\\mathcal {T}\\)), where \\(\\mathcal {T}\\) is a first-order theory. In this paper, we focus on one particular challenge for program synthesizers, namely the generation of programs that require non-trivial constants. This is a fundamentally difficult task for state-of-the-art synthesizers. We present two exemplars, one based on Fourier-Motzkin (FM) variable elimination and one based on first-order satisfiability. We demonstrate the practical value of CEGIS(\\(\\mathcal {T}\\)) by automatically synthesizing programs for a set of intricate benchmarks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Cambridge", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "Diffblue Ltd., Oxford, UK"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Alessandro Abate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abate:Alessandro", "Cristina David.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/David:Cristina", "Pascal Kesseli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kesseli:Pascal", "Daniel Kroening.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kroening:Daniel", "Elizabeth Polgreen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polgreen:Elizabeth"], "pages": 19}
