{"title": "Deterministic Distributed Edge-Coloring via Hypergraph Maximal Matching.", "fields": ["edge coloring", "hypergraph", "degree", "maximal independent set", "p complete"], "abstract": "We present a deterministic distributed algorithm that computes a (2\u03b4-1)-edge-coloring, or even list-edge-coloring, in any n-node graph with maximum degree \u03b4, in O(log^8 \u03b4 \u22c5 log n) rounds. This answers one of the long-standing open questions of distributed graph algorithms} from the late 1980s, which asked for a polylogarithmic-time algorithm. See, e.g., Open Problem 4 in the Distributed Graph Coloring book of Barenboim and Elkin. The previous best round complexities were 2^{O(\u221a{log n})} by Panconesi and Srinivasan [STOC92] and \u00d5(\u221a{\u03b4}) + O(log^* n) by Fraigniaud, Heinrich, and Kosowski [FOCS16]. A corollary of our deterministic list-edge-coloring also improves the randomized complexity of (2\u03b4-1)-edge-coloring to poly(loglog n) rounds.The key technical ingredient is a deterministic distributed algorithm for hypergraph maximal matching, which we believe will be of interest beyond this result. In any hypergraph of rank r \u2014 where each hyperedge has at most r vertices \u2014 with n nodes and maximum degree \u03b4, this algorithm computes a maximal matching in O(r^5 log^{6+log r } \u03b4 \u22c5 log n) rounds.This hypergraph matching algorithm and its extensions also lead to a number of other results. In particular, we obtain a polylogarithmic-time deterministic distributed maximal independent set (MIS) algorithm for graphs with bounded neighborhood independence, hence answering Open Problem 5 of Barenboim and Elkins book, a \\big((log \u03b4/\u03b5)^{O(log 1/\u03b5)}\\big)-round deterministic algorithm for (1+\u03b5)-approximation of maximum matching, and a quasi-polylogarithmic-time deterministic distributed algorithm for orienting \u03bb-arboricity graphs with out-degree at most \\lceil (1+\u03b5)\u03bb \\rceil, for any constant \u03b5 0, hence partially answering Open Problem 10 of Barenboim and Elkins book.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "University of Freiburg"], "authors": ["Manuela Fischer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischer:Manuela", "Mohsen Ghaffari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghaffari:Mohsen", "Fabian Kuhn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhn:Fabian"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
