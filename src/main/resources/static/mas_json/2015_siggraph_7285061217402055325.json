It is, however, still difficult to recover a face shape from a non-frontal face image. Method using shading cues on a face depends on the lighting circumstance and cannot be adapted to images in which shadows occurs, for example [Kemelmacher et al. 2011]. On the other hand, [Blanz et al. 2004] reconstructed a shape by 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) only with facial feature points. This method, however, requires the pose-wise correspondences of vertices in the model to feature points of input image because a face contour cannot be seen when the facial direction is not the front. In this paper, we propose a method which can reconstruct a facial shape from a non-frontal face image only with a single general correspondence table. Our method searches for the correspondences of points on a facial contour in the iterative reconstruction process, and makes the reconstruction simple and stable.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Waseda University", "Waseda University", "Waseda University"], "authors": ["Naoki Nozawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nozawa:Naoki", "Daiki Kuwahara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuwahara:Daiki", "Shigeo Morishima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morishima:Shigeo"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
