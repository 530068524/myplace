{"title": "Shape and Illumination from Shading using the Generic Viewpoint Assumption.", "fields": ["prior probability", "shading", "spherical harmonics", "mathematical optimization", "computer vision"], "abstract": "The Generic Viewpoint Assumption (GVA) states that the position of the viewer or the light in a scene is not special. Thus, any estimated parameters from an observation should be stable under small perturbations such as object, viewpoint or light positions. The GVA has been analyzed and quantified in previous works, but has not been put to practical use in actual vision tasks. In this paper, we show how to utilize the GVA to estimate shape and illumination from a single shading image, without the use of other priors. We propose a novel linearized Spherical Harmonics (SH) shading model which enables us to obtain a computationally efficient form of the GVA term. Together with a data term, we build a model whose unknowns are shape and SH illumination. The model parameters are estimated using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers embedded in a multi-scale estimation framework. In this prior-free framework, we obtain competitive shape and illumination estimation results under a variety of models and lighting conditions, requiring fewer assumptions than competing methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Boston College", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Daniel Zoran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zoran:Daniel", "Dilip Krishnan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krishnan:Dilip", "Jos\u00e9 Bento.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bento:Jos=eacute=", "Bill Freeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freeman:Bill"], "pages": 9}
