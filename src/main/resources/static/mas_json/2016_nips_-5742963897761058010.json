Though recent advances in regression technologies have made it possible to reveal price-demand relationship of a number of multiple products, most existing price optimization methods, such as mixed integer programming formulation, cannot handle tens or hundreds of products because of their high computational costs. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes a novel approach based on network flow algorithms. We reveal a connection between supermodularity of the revenue and cross elasticity of demand. On the basis of this connection, we propose an efficient algorithm that employs network flow algorithms. The proposed algorithm can handle hundreds or thousands of products, and returns an exact optimal solution under an assumption regarding cross elasticity of demand. Even in case in which the assumption does not hold, the proposed algorithm can efficiently find approximate solutions as good as can other state-of-the-art methods, as empirical results show.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": [], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shinji Ito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ito:Shinji", "Ryohei Fujimaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fujimaki:Ryohei"], "pages": 9}
