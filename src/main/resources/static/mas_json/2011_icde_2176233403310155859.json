Traditionally, rewrite of queries and programs are done independently, by the database query optimzier and the language compiler respectively, leaving out many optimization opportunities. Our tool aims to bridge this gap by performing holistic transformations, which include both program and query rewrite.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], "authors": ["Mahendra Chavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chavan:Mahendra", "Ravindra Guravannavar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guravannavar:Ravindra", "Karthik Ramachandra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramachandra_0002:Karthik", "S.
