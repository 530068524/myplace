Its computational cost, however, makes it unscalable and impractical for applications involving large datasets or real-time responsiveness, which are becoming increasingly common. We present a new method, QUIC-SVD, for fast approximation of the whole-matrix SVD based on a new sampling mechanism called the cosine tree. Our empirical tests show speedups of several orders of magnitude over exact SVD. Such scalability should enable QUIC-SVD to accelerate and enable a wide array of SVD-based methods and applications.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Michael P.
