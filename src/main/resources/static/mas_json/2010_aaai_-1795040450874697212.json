{"title": "Dominance Testing via Model Checking.", "fields": ["ctl", "reachability", "kripke structure", "model checking", "temporal logic"], "abstract": "Dominance testing, the problem of determining whether an outcome is preferred over another, is of fundamental importance in many applications. Hence, there is a need for algorithms and tools for dominance testing. CP-nets and TCP-nets are some of the widely studied languages for representing and reasoning with preferences. We reduce dominance testing in TCP-nets to reachability analysis in a graph of outcomes. We provide an encoding of TCP-nets in the form of a Kripke structure for CTL. We show how to compute dominance using NuSMV, a model checker for CTL. We present results of experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to dominance testing.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Ganesh Ram Santhanam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santhanam:Ganesh_Ram", "Samik Basu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basu:Samik", "Vasant G.
