We consider a stochastic model of a cloud computing cluster, where jobs arrive according to a stochastic process and request virtual machines (VMs), which are specified in terms of resources such as CPU, memory and storage space. While there are many design issues associated with such systems, here we focus only on resource allocation problems, such as the design of algorithms for load balancing among servers, and algorithms for scheduling VM configurations. Given our model of a cloud, we first define its capacity, i.e., the maximum rates at which jobs can be processed in such a system. Then, we show that the widely-used Best-Fit scheduling algorithm is not throughput-optimal, and present alternatives which achieve any arbitrary fraction of the capacity region of the cloud. We then study the delay performance of these alternative algorithms through simulations.", "citation": "Citations (267)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Siva Theja Maguluri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maguluri:Siva_Theja", "R.
