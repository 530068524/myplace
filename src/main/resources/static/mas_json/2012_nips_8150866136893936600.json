{"title": "Scalable imputation of genetic data with a discrete fragmentation-coagulation process.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "merge", "scalability", "imputation", "markov model"], "abstract": "We present a Bayesian nonparametric model for genetic sequence data in which a set of genetic sequences is modelled using a Markov model of partitions. The partitions at consecutive locations in the genome are related by the splitting and merging of their clusters. Our model can be thought of as a discrete analogue of the continuous fragmentation-coagulation process [Teh et al 2011], preserving the important properties of projectivity, exchangeability and reversibility, while being more scalable. We apply this model to the problem of genotype imputation, showing improved computational efficiency while maintaining accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art genotype imputation methods.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University College London", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Lloyd T.
