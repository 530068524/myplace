In this paper we propose an automatic approach for straightening up slanted man-made structures in an input image to improve its perceptual quality. We call this type of correction upright adjustment. We propose a set of criteria for upright adjustment based on human perception studies, and develop an optimization framework which yields an optimal homography for adjustment. We also develop a new optimization-based camera calibration method that performs favorably to previous methods and allows the proposed system to work reliably for a wide variety of images. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated by both quantitative comparisons and qualitative user studies.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Pohang University of Science and Technology", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Pohang University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hyunjoon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Hyunjoon", "Eli Shechtman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shechtman:Eli", "Jue Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Jue", "Seungyong Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Seungyong"], "pages": 8}
