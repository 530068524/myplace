However, ultra-small computing platforms like the Sony SmartWatch and Apple iPod Nano lack a means of text entry. This limits their potential, despite the fact they are quite capable computers. In this work, we present a soft keyboard interaction technique called ZoomBoard that enables text entry on ultra-small devices. Our approach uses iterative zooming to enlarge otherwise impossibly tiny keys to comfortable size. We based our design on a QWERTY layout, so that it is immediately familiar to users and leverages existing skill. As the ultimate test, we ran a text entry experiment on a keyboard measuring just 16 x 6mm - smaller than a US penny. After eight practice trials, users achieved an average of 9.3 words per minute, with accuracy comparable to a full-sized physical keyboard. This compares favorably to existing mobile text input methods.", "citation": "Citations (135)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Stephen Oney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oney:Stephen", "Chris Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Chris", "Amy Ogan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogan:Amy", "Jason Wiese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wiese:Jason"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
