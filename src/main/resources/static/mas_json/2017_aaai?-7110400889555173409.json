Reasoning on these large amounts of geospatial data requires efficient methods for the computation of links between the resources contained in these knowledge bases. In this paper, we present Radon \u2013 efficient solution for the discovery of topological relations between geospatial resources according to the DE9-IM standard. Our evaluation shows that we outperform the state of the art significantly and by several orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Leipzig University", "Leipzig University", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Leipzig University"], "authors": ["Mohamed Ahmed Sherif.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sherif:Mohamed_Ahmed", "Kevin Dre\u00dfler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dre=szlig=ler:Kevin", "Panayiotis Smeros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smeros:Panayiotis", "Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ngomo:Axel=Cyrille_Ngonga"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
