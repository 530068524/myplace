Drawing from this success, we are exploring the use of an online community to build a support group for parents currently in receipt of income support but needing to transition to find a job. Complementing the financial and informational support offered through existing welfare transition programs, our work aims to help people improve their prospect of finding a job to become financially self-sufficient and develop a support network to help them in their transition back to work. In this paper, we present the design of a journey of reflection and collaboration to encourage reflective thinking and foster relationships between community members.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation"], "authors": ["Nathalie Colineau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colineau:Nathalie", "C\u00e9cile Paris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paris:C=eacute=cile", "Surya Nepal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nepal:Surya"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
