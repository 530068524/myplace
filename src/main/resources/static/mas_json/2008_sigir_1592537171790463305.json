Prior work has exploited the class labels of nearby pages to improve performance. In contrast, in this work we utilize a weighted combination of the contents of neighbors to generate a better virtual document for classification. In addition, we break pages into fields, finding that a weighted combination of text from the target and fields of neighboring pages is able to reduce classification error by more than a third. We demonstrate performance on a large dataset of pages from the Open Directory Project and validate the approach using pages from a crawl from the Stanford WebBase. Interestingly, we find no value in anchor text and unexpected value in page titles (and especially titles of parent pages) in the virtual document.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["Lehigh University", "Lehigh University"], "authors": ["Xiaoguang Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Xiaoguang", "Brian D.
