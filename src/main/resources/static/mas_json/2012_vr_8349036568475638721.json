Simulating 3D deformation of large model in real-time is a challenging problem as it is very computation-demanding involving intensive matrix-based operation of large scale. Reduction techniques, consequently flourish where the dynamic is computed within a subspace of much smaller size with accuracy loss. This type of technique greatly boosts the simulation performance. Currently, most reduction methods use globally-computed bases. As a result, when large local deformation occurs, global bases often fail to provide necessary freedoms at the desired region. Alternatively, we construct subspaces locally based on the linear component mode synthesis (CMS) method. The components are the mutually disjoint sub-meshes (with duplicated boundary DOFs) and the local bases are called component modes which are the displacements of the components under certain mechanical equilibrium.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Yin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yin", "Xiaohu Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Xiaohu"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
