{"title": "Asking the right person: supporting expertise selection in the enterprise.", "fields": ["recommender system", "knowledge management", "computer science"], "abstract": "Expertise selection is the process of choosing an expert from a list of recommended people. This is an important and nuanced step in expertise location that has not received a great deal of attention. Through a lab-based, controlled investigation with 35 enterprise workers, we found that presenting additional information about each recommended person in a search result list led the participants to make quicker and better-informed selections. These results focus attention on a currently understudied aspect of expertise location--expertise selection--that could greatly improve the usefulness of supporting systems. We also asked participants to rate the type of information that might be most useful for expertise selection on a paper prototype containing 36 types of potentially helpful information. We identified sixteen types of this information that may be most useful for various expertise selection tasks.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Svetlana Yarosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yarosh:Svetlana", "Tara Matthews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matthews:Tara", "Michelle X.
