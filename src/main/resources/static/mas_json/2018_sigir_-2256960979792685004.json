{"title": "A Personal Privacy Preserving Framework: I Let You Know Who Can See What.", "fields": ["social media", "openness to experience", "social network", "computer science", "data mining"], "abstract": "The booming of social networks has given rise to a large volume of user-generated contents (UGCs), most of which are free and publicly available. A lot of users' personal aspects can be extracted from these UGCs to facilitate personalized applications as validated by many previous studies. Despite their value, UGCs can place users at high privacy risks, which thus far remains largely untapped. Privacy is defined as the individual's ability to control what information is disclosed, to whom, when and under what circumstances. As people and information both play significant roles, privacy has been elaborated as a boundary regulation process, where individuals regulate interaction with others by altering the openness degree of themselves to others. In this paper, we aim to reduce users' privacy risks on social networks by answering the question of Who Can See What. Towards this goal, we present a novel scheme, comprising of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive components. In particular, we first collect a set of posts and extract a group of privacy-oriented features to describe the posts. We then propose a novel taxonomy-guided multi-task learning model to predict which personal aspects are uncovered by the posts. Lastly, we construct standard guidelines by the user study with 400 users to regularize users' actions for preventing their privacy leakage. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset well verified our scheme.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Shandong University", "Shandong University", "National University of Singapore", "Shandong University", "National Unvers ... pore, Singapore"], "authors": ["Xuemeng Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Xuemeng", "Xiang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiang", "Liqiang Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Liqiang", "Xiangnan He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He_0001:Xiangnan", "Zhumin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhumin", "Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wei"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
