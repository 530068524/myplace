{"title": "On Constructing Efficient Shared Decision Trees for Multiple Packet Filters.", "fields": ["network packet", "greedy algorithm", "decision tree", "routing protocol", "memory management"], "abstract": "Multiple packet filters serving different purposes (e.g., firewalling, QoS) and different virtual routers are often deployed on a single physical router. The HyperCuts decision tree is one efficient data structure for performing packet filter matching in software. Constructing a separate HyperCuts decision tree for each packet filter is not memory efficient. A natural alternative is to construct shared HyperCuts decision trees to more efficiently support multiple packet filters. However, we experimentally show that naively classifying packet filters into shared HyperCuts decision trees may significantly increase the memory consumption and the height of the trees. To help decide which subset of packet filters should share a HyperCuts decision tree, we first identify a number of important factors that collectively impact the efficiency of the resulted shared HyperCuts decision tree. Based on the identified factors, we then propose to use machine learning techniques to predict whether any pair of packet filters should share a tree. Given the pair-wise prediction matrix, a greedy heuristic algorithm is used to classify packets filters into a number of shared HyperCuts decision trees. Our experiments using both real packets filters and synthetic packet filters show that the shared HyperCuts decision trees consume considerably less memory.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Bo Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Bo", "T.
