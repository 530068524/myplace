Although such analysis can facilitate better understanding of sociological, behavioral, and other interesting phenomena, there is a growing concern about personal privacy being breached, thereby requiring effective anonymization techniques. In this paper, we consider edge weight anonymization in social graphs. Our approach builds a linear programming (LP) model which preserves properties of the graph that are expressible as linear functions of the edge weights. Such properties form the foundations of many important graph-theoretic algorithms such as shortest paths, k-nearest neighbors, minimum spanning tree, etc. Off-the-shelf LP solvers can then be used to find solutions to the resulting model where the computed solution constitutes the weights in the anonymized graph. As a proof of concept, we choose the shortest paths problem, and experimentally evaluate the proposed techniques using real social network data sets.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Sudipto Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Sudipto", "\u00d6mer Egecioglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egecioglu:=Ouml=mer", "Amr El Abbadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbadi:Amr_El"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
