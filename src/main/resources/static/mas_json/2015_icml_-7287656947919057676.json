A key feature of Markov M3 is that it interprets the mixed membership assignment as a Markov random walk over this graph of nodes. This is in contrast to tree-structured models in which the assignment is done according to a tree structure on the mixing components. The Markov structure results in a simple parametric model that can learn a complex dependency structure between nodes, while still maintaining full conjugacy for closed-form stochastic variational inference. Empirical results demonstrate that Markov M3 performs well compared with tree structured topic models, and can learn meaningful dependency structure between topics.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Aonan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Aonan", "John Paisley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paisley:John"], "pages": 9}
