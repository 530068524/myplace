This language modeling objective incentivises the system to learn general-purpose patterns of semantic and syntactic composition, which are also useful for improving accuracy on different sequence labeling tasks. The architecture was evaluated on a range of datasets, covering the tasks of error detection in learner texts, named entity recognition, chunking and POS-tagging. The novel language modeling objective provided consistent performance improvements on every benchmark, without requiring any additional annotated or unannotated data.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Cambridge"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Marek Rei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rei:Marek"], "pages": 10}
