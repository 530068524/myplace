The best previous bound for GI was exp(O( \u221an log n)), where n is the number of vertices (Luks, 1983); for the other two problems, the bound was similar, exp(O~(\u221a n)), where n is the size of the permutation domain (Babai, 1983). Following the approach of Luks\u2019s seminal 1980/82 paper, the problem we actually address is SI. This problem takes two strings of length n and a permutation group G of degree n (the \u201cambient group\u201d) as input (G is given by a list of generators) and asks whether or not one of the strings can be transformed into the other by some element of G. Luks\u2019s divide-and-conquer algorithm for SI proceeds by recursion on the ambient group. We build on Luks\u2019s framework and attack the obstructions to efficient Luks recurrence via an interplay between local and global symmetry. We construct group theoretic \u201clocal certificates\u201d to certify the presence or absence of local symmetry, aggregate the negative certificates to canonical k-ary relations where k = O(log n), and employ combinatorial canonical partitioning techniques to split the k-ary relational structure for efficient divide-and- conquer. We show that in a well\u2013defined sense, Johnson graphs are the only obstructions to effective canonical partitioning. The central element of the algorithm is the \u201clocal certificates\u201d routine which is based on a new group theoretic result, the \u201cUnaffected stabilizers lemma,\u201d that allows us to construct global automorphisms out of local information.", "citation": "Citations (62)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Chicago"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babai:L=aacute=szl=oacute="], "pages": 14}
