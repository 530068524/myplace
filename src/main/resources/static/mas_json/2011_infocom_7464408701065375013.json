The MBS zone technology is proposed in Mobile Communications Network (MCN) standards to improve system capacity and reduce the handoff delay for the wireless MBS calls. In the MBS zone technology, a group of BSs form an MBS zone, where the macro diversity is applied in the MS, the BSs synchronize to transmit the MBS content on the same common channel, interference caused by the common channel is reduced, and the MBS MSs need not perform handoff while moving between the BSs in the same MBS zone. However, when there is no MBS MS in a BS with the MBS zone technology, the transmission on the common channel wastes the bandwidth of the BS. It is an important issue to determine the condition for the MBS Controller (MBSC) to enable the MBS zone technology by considering the QoS for traditional calls and MBS calls. In this paper, we propose two Dynamic Channel Allocation schemes: DCA and EDCA by considering the condition for enabling the MBS zone technology. Analysis and simulation experiments are conducted to investigate the performance of DCA and EDCA.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Zih-Ci Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Zih=Ci", "Huai-Lei Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Huai=Lei", "Phone Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Phone"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
