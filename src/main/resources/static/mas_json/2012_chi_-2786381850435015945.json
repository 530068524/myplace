The rich mixture of technologies currently deployed during this brief period are categorized and critically analyzed. We then reflect on the implications of our findings, both for the design of technology that takes the end of life into account, and for the wider HCI community.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of Dundee", "University of Dundee", "London Metropolitan University", "University of Bath"], "authors": ["Wendy Moncur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moncur:Wendy", "Jan Bikker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bikker:Jan", "Elaine Kasket.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kasket:Elaine", "John Troyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Troyer:John"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
