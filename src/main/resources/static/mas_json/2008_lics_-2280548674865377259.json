{"title": "Second-Order and Dependently-Sorted Abstract Syntax.", "fields": ["abstract syntax", "metavariable", "mathematical theory", "abstract syntax tree", "categorical algebra"], "abstract": "The paper develops a mathematical theory in the spirit of categorical algebra that provides a model theory for second-order and dependently-sorted syntax. The theory embodies notions such as alpha-equivalence, variable binding, capture-avoiding simultaneous substitution, term metavariable, meta-substitution, mono and multi sorting, and sort dependency. As a matter of illustration, a model is used to extract a second-order syntactic theory, which is thus guaranteed to be correct by construction.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Marcelo P.
