Approaches such as exponential family PCA and non-negative matrix factorisation have successfully extended PCA to non-Gaussian data types, but these techniques fail to take advantage of Bayesian inference and can suffer from problems of over-fitting and poor generalisation. This paper presents a fully probabilistic approach to PCA, which is generalised to the exponential family, based on Hybrid Monte Carlo sampling. We describe the model which is based on a factorisation of the observed data matrix, and show performance of the model on both synthetic and real data.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shakir Mohamed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohamed:Shakir", "Katherine A.
