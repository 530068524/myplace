The objective is to design strategyproof mechanisms which are competitive against the most efficient (but not strategyproof) mechanism.\n\nFor the case with two items: \u2022 We provide a set of sufficient conditions for strategyproofness. \u2022 We use an analytic approach to derive strategyproof mechanisms which are more competitive than all prior strategyproof mechanisms. \u2022 We improve the linear-program-based proof of Guo and Conitzer [2010] to show new upper bounds on competitive ratios. \u2022 We provide the first compact proof on upper bound of competitiveness. For the cases with any number of items, we build on the Partial Allocation mechanisms introduced by Cole et al. [2013a; 2013b] to design a strategyproof mechanism which is 0.67776-competitive, breaking the 2/3 barrier.\n\nWe also propose a new sub-class of strategyproof mechanisms for any numbers of agents and items, which we call it Dynamic-Increasing-Price mechanisms, where each agent purchases the items using virtual money, and the prices of the items depend on other agents' preferences.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Vienna"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yun Kuen Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Yun_Kuen"], "pages": 7}
