{"title": "Computing Observation Vectors for Max-Fault Min-Cardinality Diagnoses.", "fields": ["cardinality", "automatic test pattern generation", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) typically focuses on diagnoses, minimal under some minimality criterion, e.g., the minimal-cardinality set of faulty components that explain an observation \u03b1. However, for different \u03b1 there may be minimal-cardinality diagnoses of differing cardinalities, and several applications (such as test pattern generation and benchmark model analysis) need to identify the \u03b1 leading to the max-cardinality diagnosis amongst them. We denote this problem as a Max-Fault Min-Cardinality (MFMC) problem. This paper considers the generation of observations that lead to MFMC diagnoses. We present a near-optimal, stochastic algorithm, called MIRANDA (Max-fault mIn-caRdinAlity observatioN Deduction Algorithm), that computes MFMC observations. Compared to optimal, deterministic approaches such as ATPG, the algorithm has very low cost, allowing us to generate observations corresponding to high-cardinality faults. Experiments show that MIRANDA delivers optimal results on the 74XXX circuits, as well as good MFMC cardinality estimates on the larger ISCAS85 circuits.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Delft University of Technology", "University College Cork", "Delft University of Technology"], "authors": ["Alexander Feldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldman:Alexander", "Gregory M.
