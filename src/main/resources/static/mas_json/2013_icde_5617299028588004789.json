User queries are expressed over a global relational layer and are evaluated by \u03a0gora using a range of strategies, including data conversion into one probabilistic formalism followed by evaluation using a formalism-specific engine, and hybrid plans, where subqueries are evaluated using engines for different formalisms. This demonstration allows users to experience \u03a0gora on real-world heterogeneous data sources from the medical domain.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Dan Olteanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olteanu:Dan", "Lampros Papageorgiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papageorgiou:Lampros", "Sebastiaan J. van Schaik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaik:Sebastiaan_J=_van"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
