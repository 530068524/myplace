In our research, we examined how local organizations tried to build and maintain connectedness over time as a network to fight child sex trafficking. We sought to understand how technology supports the social processes of connectedness in this context. Based on our analysis of the field data from this case study, we identify three categories of activities for building and maintaining connectedness. We also find that while different technologies are suited towards supporting different aspects of connectedness, there may be gaps in how adequately social media tools support connectedness in civic networks.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Jennifer Stoll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoll:Jennifer", "W.
