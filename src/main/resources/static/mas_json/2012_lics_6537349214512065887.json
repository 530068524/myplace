To that end, we introduce dense-timed pushdown automata that extend the classical models of pushdown automata and timed automata, in the sense that the automaton operates on a finite set of real-valued clocks, and each symbol in the stack is equipped with a real-valued clock representing its \"age\". The model induces a transition system that is infinite in two dimensions, namely it gives rise to a stack with an unbounded number of symbols each of which with a real-valued clock. The main contribution of the paper is an EXPTIME-complete algorithm for solving the reachability problem for dense-timed pushdown automata.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Uppsala University", "Uppsala University"], "authors": ["Parosh Aziz Abdulla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdulla:Parosh_Aziz", "Mohamed Faouzi Atig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atig:Mohamed_Faouzi", "Jari Stenman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stenman:Jari"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
