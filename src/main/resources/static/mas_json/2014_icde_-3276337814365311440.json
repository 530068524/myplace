In this paper, we show that in modern high-throughput transaction processing systems, this is no longer the optimal way to recover a database system. In particular, as transaction throughputs get higher, ARIES-style logging starts to represent a non-trivial fraction of the overall transaction execution time.", "citation": "Citations (96)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "VoltDB Inc., USA"], "authors": ["Nirmesh Malviya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malviya:Nirmesh", "Ariel Weisberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weisberg:Ariel", "Samuel Madden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madden:Samuel", "Michael Stonebraker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stonebraker:Michael"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
