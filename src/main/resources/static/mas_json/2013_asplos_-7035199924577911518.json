{"title": "Using likely invariants for automated software fault localization.", "fields": ["debugging", "program analysis", "root cause", "software quality", "software bug"], "abstract": "We propose an automatic diagnosis technique for isolating the root cause(s) of software failures. We use likely program invariants, automatically generated using correct inputs that are close to the fault-triggering input, to select a set of candidate program locations which are possible root causes. We then trim the set of candidate root causes using software-implemented dynamic backwards slicing, plus two new filtering heuristics: dependence filtering, and filtering via multiple failing inputs that are also close to the failing input. Experimental results on reported software bugs of three large open-source servers show that we are able to narrow down the number of candidate bug locations to between 5 and 17 program expressions, even in programs that are hundreds of thousands of lines long.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Swarup Kumar Sahoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sahoo:Swarup_Kumar", "John Criswell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Criswell:John", "Chase Geigle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geigle:Chase", "Vikram S.
