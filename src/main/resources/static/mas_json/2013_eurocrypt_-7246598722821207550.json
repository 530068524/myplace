The first construction CE l , called l-cascade encryption, is obtained by sequentially composing l blockcipher calls with indepen- dent keys. The security of CE l has been a longstanding open problem until Gazi and Maurer (9) proved its security up to 2 \u03ba +min{ n 2 ,\u03ba} query complexity for large cascading length, where \u03ba and n denote the key size and the block size of the underlying blockcipher, respectively. We improve this limit by proving the security of CE l up to 2 \u03ba +min{\u03ba,n}\u2212 16 l ( n 2 +2) query complexity: this bound approaches 2 \u03ba +min{\u03ba,n} with increasing cascade length l. The second construction XCE l is a natural cascade version of the DESX scheme with intermediate keys xored between blockcipher calls. This can also be viewed as an extension of double XOR-cascade pro- posed by Gazi and Tessaro (10). We prove that XCE l is secure up to 2 \u03ba +n\u2212 8 l ( n 2 +2) query complexity. As cascade length l increases, this bound approaches 2 \u03ba+n .", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Sejong University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Jooyoung Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jooyoung"], "pages": 21}
