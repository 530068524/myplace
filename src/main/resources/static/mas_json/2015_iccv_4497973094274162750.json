{"title": "Learning Parametric Distributions for Image Super-Resolution: Where Patch Matching Meets Sparse Coding.", "fields": ["image warping", "binary image", "image texture", "feature detection", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "Existing approaches toward Image super-resolution (SR) is often either data-driven (e.g., based on internet-scale matching and web image retrieval) or model-based (e.g., formulated as an Maximizing a Posterior estimation problem). The former is conceptually simple yet heuristic, while the latter is constrained by the fundamental limit of frequency aliasing. In this paper, we propose to develop a hybrid approach toward SR by combining those two lines of ideas. More specifically, the parameters underlying sparse distributions of desirable HR image patches are learned from a pair of LR image and retrieved HR images. Our hybrid approach can be interpreted as the first attempt of reconciling the difference between parametric and nonparametric models for low-level vision tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid SR method performs much better than existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both subjective and objective image qualities.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Xidian University", "Xidian University", "Xidian University", "Xidian University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yongbo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yongbo", "Weisheng Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Weisheng", "Guangming Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Guangming", "Xuemei Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Xuemei"], "pages": 9}
