{"title": "New hardness results for routing on disjoint paths.", "fields": ["graph bandwidth", "graph power", "degree", "wheel graph", "path graph"], "abstract": "In the classical Node-Disjoint Paths (NDP) problem, the input consists of an undirected  n -vertex graph  G , and a collection  M ={( s  1 , t  1 ),\u00e2 \ufffd,( s   k  , t   k  )} of pairs of its vertices, called source-destination, or demand, pairs. The goal is to route the largest possible number of the demand pairs via node-disjoint paths. The best current approximation for the problem is achieved by a simple greedy algorithm, whose approximation factor is  O (\u00e2   n ), while the best current negative result is an I\u00a9(log 1/2\u00e2  I\ufffd  n )-hardness of approximation for any constant I\ufffd, under standard complexity assumptions. Even seemingly simple special cases of the problem are still poorly understood: when the input graph is a grid, the best current algorithm achieves an \ufffd ( n  1/4 )-approximation, and when it is a general planar graph, the best current approximation ratio of an efficient algorithm is \ufffd ( n  9/19 ). The best currently known lower bound for both these versions of the problem is APX-hardness.   In this paper we prove that NDP is 2 I\u00a9(\u00e2  log n ) -hard to approximate, unless all problems in NP have algorithms with running time  n   O (log n ) . Our result holds even when the underlying graph is a planar graph with maximum vertex degree 4, and all source vertices lie on the boundary of a single face (but the destination vertices may lie anywhere in the graph). We extend this result to the closely related Edge-Disjoint Paths problem, showing the same hardness of approximation ratio even for sub-cubic planar graphs with all sources lying on the boundary of a single face.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "University of Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Julia Chuzhoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chuzhoy:Julia", "David H.
