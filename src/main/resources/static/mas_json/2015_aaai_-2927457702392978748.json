{"title": "Recovering Causal Effects from Selection Bias.", "fields": ["selection bias", "confounding", "markov process", "generality", "sampling bias"], "abstract": "Controlling for selection and confounding biases are two of the most challenging problems that appear in data analysis in the empirical sciences as well as in artificial intelligence tasks. The combination of previously studied methods for each of these biases in isolation is not directly applicable to certain non-trivial cases in which selection and confounding biases are simultaneously present. In this paper, we tackle these instances non-parametrically and in full generality. We provide graphical and algorithmic conditions for recov-erability of interventional distributions for when selection and confounding biases are both present. Our treatment completely characterizes the class of causal effects that are recoverable in Markovian models, and is sufficient for Semi-Markovian models.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Elias Bareinboim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bareinboim:Elias", "Jin Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Jin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
