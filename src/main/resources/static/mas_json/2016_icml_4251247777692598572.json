{"title": "Contextual Combinatorial Cascading Bandits.", "fields": ["prefix", "pattern recognition", "regret", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We propose the contextual combinatorial cascading bandits, a combinatorial online learning game, where at each time step a learning agent is given a set of contextual information, then selects a list of items, and observes stochastic outcomes of a prefix in the selected items by some stopping criterion. In online recommendation, the stopping criterion might be the first item a user selects; in network routing, the stopping criterion might be the first edge blocked in a path. We consider position discounts in the list order, so that the agent's reward is discounted depending on the position where the stopping criterion is met. We design a UCB-type algorithm, C3-UCB, for this problem, prove an n-step regret bound O(\u221an) in the general setting, and give finer analysis for two special cases. Our work generalizes existing studies in several directions, including contextual information, position discounts, and a more general cascading bandit model. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the advantage of involving contextual information and position discounts.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Shuai Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shuai", "Baoxiang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Baoxiang", "Shengyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shengyu", "Wei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Wei"], "pages": 9}
