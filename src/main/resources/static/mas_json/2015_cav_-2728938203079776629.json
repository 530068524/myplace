{"title": "Counterexample Explanation by Learning Small Strategies in Markov Decision Processes.", "fields": ["counterexample", "determinism", "binary decision diagram", "markov decision process", "cumulative distribution function"], "abstract": "For deterministic systems, a counterexample to a property can simply be an error trace, whereas counterexamples in probabilistic systems are necessarily more complex. For instance, a set of erroneous traces with a sufficient cumulative probability mass can be used. Since these are too large objects to understand and manipulate, compact representations such as subchains have been considered. In the case of probabilistic systems with non-determinism, the situation is even more complex. While a subchain for a given strategy (or scheduler, resolving non-determinism) is a straightforward choice, we take a different approach. Instead, we focus on the strategy itself, and extract the most important decisions it makes, and present its succinct representation.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Masaryk University", "IST, Klosterneuburg, Austria", "IST, Klosterneuburg, Austria", "IST, Klosterneuburg, Austria", "IST, Klosterneuburg, Austria"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s Br\u00e1zdil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Br=aacute=zdil:Tom=aacute=s", "Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Martin Chmelik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chmelik:Martin", "Andreas Fellner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fellner:Andreas", "Jan Kret\u00ednsk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kret=iacute=nsk=yacute=:Jan"], "pages": 20}
