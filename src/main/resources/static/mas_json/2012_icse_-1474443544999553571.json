{"title": "Towards flexible evolution of Dynamically Adaptive Systems.", "fields": ["open system", "scripting language", "control reconfiguration", "software system", "software maintenance"], "abstract": "Modern software systems need to be continuously available under varying conditions. Their ability to dynamically adapt to their execution context is thus increasingly seen as a key to their success. Recently, many approaches were proposed to design and support the execution of Dynamically Adaptive Systems (DAS). However, the ability of a DAS to evolve is limited to the addition, update or removal of adaptation rules or reconfiguration scripts. These artifacts are very specific to the control loop managing such a DAS and runtime evolution of the DAS requirements may affect other parts of the DAS. In this paper, we argue to evolve all parts of the loop. We suggest leveraging recent advances in model-driven techniques to offer an approach that supports the evolution of both systems and their adaptation capabilities. The basic idea is to consider the control loop itself as an adaptive system.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 de Namur", "University of Luxembourg", "SINTEFIKT, OSLO, Norway", "SINTEFIKT, OSLO, Norway", "SINTEFIKT, OSLO, Norway"], "authors": ["Gilles Perrouin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perrouin:Gilles", "Brice Morin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morin:Brice", "Franck Chauvel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chauvel:Franck", "Franck Fleurey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fleurey:Franck", "Jacques Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Jacques", "Yves Le Traon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traon:Yves_Le", "Olivier Barais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barais:Olivier", "Jean-Marc J\u00e9z\u00e9quel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=eacute=z=eacute=quel:Jean=Marc"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
