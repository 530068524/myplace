{"title": "Re-examining price as a predictor of answer quality in an online q&a site.", "fields": ["question answering", "knowledge market", "ask price", "information quality", "online community"], "abstract": "Online question-answering services provide mechanisms for knowledge exchange by allowing users to ask and answer questions on a wide range of topics. A key question for designing such services is whether charging a price has an effect on answer quality. Two field experiments using one such service, Google Answers, offer conflicting answers to this question. To resolve this inconsistency, we re-analyze data from Harper et al. [5] and Chen et al. [2] to study the price effect in greater depth. Decomposing the price effect into two different levels yields results that reconcile those of the two field experiments. Specifically, we find that: (1) a higher price significantly increases the likelihood that a question receives an answer and (2) for questions that receive an answer, there is no significant price effect on answer quality. Additionally, we find that the rater background makes a difference in evaluating answer quality.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Grace YoungJoo Jeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeon:Grace_YoungJoo", "Yong-Mi Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Yong=Mi", "Yan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0014:Yan"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
