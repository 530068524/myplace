{"title": "Submodularity beyond submodular energies: Coupling edges in graph cuts.", "fields": ["subroutine", "approximation algorithm", "cut", "multiple edges", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "We propose a new family of non-submodular global energy functions that still use submodularity internally to couple edges in a graph cut. We show it is possible to develop an efficient approximation algorithm that, thanks to the internal submodularity, can use standard graph cuts as a subroutine. We demonstrate the advantages of edge coupling in a natural setting, namely image segmentation. In particular, for fine-structured objects and objects with shading variation, our structured edge coupling leads to significant improvements over standard approaches.", "citation": "Citations (146)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "University of Washington"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Stefanie Jegelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jegelka:Stefanie", "Jeff A.
