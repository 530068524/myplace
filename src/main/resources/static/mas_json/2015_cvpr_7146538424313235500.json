Existing approaches attempt to exploit this relationship information implicitly by enforcing smoothness on function evaluations only. However, what happens if we explicitly regularize the relationships between function evaluations? Inspired by homophily, we regularize based on a smooth relationship function, either defined from the data or with labels. In experiments, we demonstrate that this significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms in semi-supervised classification and in spectral data embedding for constrained clustering and dimensionality reduction.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "MPI for Informatics, Germany"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kwang In Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kwang_In", "James Tompkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tompkin:James", "Hanspeter Pfister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pfister:Hanspeter", "Christian Theobalt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobalt:Christian"], "pages": 9}
