With this approach, actions performed by important subsystems of HDFS (e.g., namespace management) are checked by a second implementation of the subsystem that uses lightweight, approximate data structures. We show that HARDFS detects and recovers from a wide range of fail-silent behaviors caused by random bit flips, targeted corruptions, and real software bugs. In particular, HARDFS handles 90% of the fail-silent faults that result from random memory corruption and correctly detects and recovers from 100% of 78 targeted corruptions and 5 real-world bugs. Moreover, it recovers orders of magnitude faster than full reboot by using micro-recovery. The extra protection in HARDFS incurs minimal performance and space overheads.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Chicago", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Thanh Do.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Do:Thanh", "Tyler Harter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harter:Tyler", "Yingchao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yingchao", "Haryadi S.
