The task has proven useful in many research areas including ontology learning, relation extraction and question answering. However, current approaches -- mostly focused on lexicosyntactic patterns -- suffer from both low recall and precision, as definitional sentences occur in highly variable syntactic structures. In this paper, we propose Word-Class Lattices (WCLs), a generalization of word lattices that we use to model textual definitions. Lattices are learned from a dataset of definitions from Wikipedia. Our method is applied to the task of definition and hypernym extraction and compares favorably to other pattern generalization methods proposed in the literature.", "citation": "Citations (114)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma", "Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto", "Paola Velardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Velardi:Paola"], "pages": 10}
