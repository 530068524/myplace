{"title": "Animating paper using shape memory alloys.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "usability", "computer science", "shape memory alloy"], "abstract": "Our aim is to make shape memory alloys (SMAs) accessible and visible as creative crafting materials by combining them with paper. In this paper, we begin by presenting mechanisms for actuating paper with SMAs along with a set of design guidelines for achieving dramatic movement. We then describe how we tested the usability and educational potential of one of these mechanisms in a workshop where participants, age 9 to 15, made actuated electronic origami cranes. We found that participants were able to successfully build constructions integrating SMAs and paper, that they enjoyed doing so, and were able to learn skills like circuitry design and soldering over the course of the workshop.", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["Massachusettes  ... bridge, MA, USA", "Massachusettes  ... sachusetts, USA"], "authors": ["Jie Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Jie", "Leah Buechley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buechley:Leah"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
