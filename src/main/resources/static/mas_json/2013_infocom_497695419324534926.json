Most of the existing works assume that the involved parties will follow the protocol honestly. In practice, a malicious adversary can easily forge his/her input values to achieve incorrect outcomes or simply lie about the computation results to cheat other parities. In this work, we focus on the problem of verifiable privacy preserving multiparty computation. We thoroughly analyze the attacks on existing privacy preserving multi-party computation approaches and design a series of protocols for dot product, ranging and ranking, which are proved to be privacy preserving and verifiable. We implement our protocols on laptops and mobile phones. The results show that our verifiable private computation protocols are efficient both in computation and communication.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Lan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lan", "Xiang-Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xiang=Yang", "Yunhao Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yunhao", "Taeho Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Taeho"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
