{"title": "Contextualizing Citations for Scientific Summarization using Word Embeddings and Domain Knowledge.", "fields": ["domain knowledge", "multi document summarization", "citation", "contextualization", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "Citation texts are sometimes not very informative or in some cases inaccurate by themselves; they need the appropriate context from the referenced paper to reflect its exact contributions. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised model that uses distributed representation of words as well as domain knowledge to extract the appropriate context from the reference paper. Evaluation results show the effectiveness of our model by significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art. We furthermore demonstrate how an effective contextualization method results in improving citation-based summarization of the scientific articles.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Georgetown University", "Georgetown University"], "authors": ["Arman Cohan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohan:Arman", "Nazli Goharian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goharian:Nazli"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
