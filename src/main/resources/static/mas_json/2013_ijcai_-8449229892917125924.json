{"title": "Nominal Schema Absorption.", "fields": ["description logic", "schema", "web ontology language", "axiom", "reasoning system"], "abstract": "Nominal schemas have recently been introduced as a new approach for the integration of DL-safe rules into the Description Logic framework. The efficient processing of knowledge bases with nominal schemas remains, however, challenging. We address this by extending the well-known optimisation of absorption as well as the standard tableau calculus to directly handle the (absorbed) nominal schema axioms. We implement the resulting extension of standard tableau calculi in a novel reasoning system and we integrate further optimisations. In our empirical evaluation, we show the effect of these optimisations and we find that the proposed approach performs well even when compared to other DL reasoners with dedicated rule support.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "derivo GmbH, Germany"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Andreas Steigmiller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steigmiller:Andreas", "Birte Glimm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glimm:Birte", "Thorsten Liebig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liebig:Thorsten"], "pages": 7}
