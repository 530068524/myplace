We show that the sum of 2 d  small-biased generators with error e 2 O(d)   is a pseudorandom generator against degree d polynomials with error e. This gives a generator with seed length 2 O(d)  log(n/e). Our construction follows the recent breakthrough result of Bogadnov and Viola. Their work shows that the sum of d small-biased generators is a pseudo-random generator against degree d polynomials, assuming the Inverse Gowers Conjecture. However, this conjecture is only proven for d=2,3. The main advantage of our work is that it does not rely on any unproven conjectures.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar"], "pages": 6}
