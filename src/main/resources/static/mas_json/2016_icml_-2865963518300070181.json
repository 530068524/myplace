We also propose a general improvement of existing state-of-the-art accelerated exact k-means algorithms through better estimates of the distance bounds used to reduce the number of distance calculations, obtaining speedups in 36 of 44 experiments, of up to 1.8\u00d7. We have conducted experiments with our own implementations of existing methods to ensure homogeneous evaluation of performance, and we show that our implementations perform as well or better than existing available implementations. Finally, we propose simplified variants of standard approaches and show that they are faster than their fully-fledged counterparts in 59 of 62 experiments.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Idiap Research Institute", "Idiap Research Institute"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["James Newling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Newling:James", "Fran\u00e7ois Fleuret.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fleuret:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 9}
