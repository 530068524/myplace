{"title": "Latent Maximum Margin Clustering.", "fields": ["correlation clustering", "margin", "data stream clustering", "fuzzy clustering", "probabilistic latent semantic analysis"], "abstract": "We present a maximum margin framework that clusters data using latent variables. Using latent representations enables our framework to model unobserved information embedded in the data. We implement our idea by large margin learning, and develop an alternating descent algorithm to effectively solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem. We instantiate our latent maximum margin clustering framework with tag-based video clustering tasks, where each video is represented by a latent tag model describing the presence or absence of video tags. Experimental results obtained on three standard datasets show that the proposed method outperforms non-latent maximum margin clustering as well as conventional clustering approaches.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Guang-Tong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guang=Tong", "Tian Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Tian", "Arash Vahdat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vahdat:Arash", "Greg Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Greg"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
