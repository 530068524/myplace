State-of-the-art tests for schedulability analysis of multiprocessor global scheduling are often incomparable. That is, a task set that is judged not schedulable by a test may be verified to be schedulable by another test, and vice versa. In this paper, we first develop a new schedulability test that integrates the limited carry-in technique and Response Time Analysis (RTA) procedure for Global EDF schedulability analysis. Then, we provide an over-approximate variant of this test with better run-time efficiency. Later, we extend these two tests to self-suspending tasks. All schedulability tests proposed in the paper have provable dominance over their state-of-the-art counterparts. Finally, we conduct extensive comparisons among different schedulability tests. Our new tests show significant improvements for schedulability analysis of Global EDF.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies", "university of lille"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Youcheng Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Youcheng", "Giuseppe Lipari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lipari:Giuseppe"], "pages": 11}
