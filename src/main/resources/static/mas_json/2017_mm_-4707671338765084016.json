We introduce ChainerCV, a software library that is intended to fill this gap. ChainerCV supports numerous neural network models as well as software components needed to conduct research in computer vision. These implementations emphasize simplicity, flexibility and good software engineering practices. The library is designed to perform on par with the results reported in published papers and its tools can be used as a baseline for future research in computer vision. Our implementation includes sophisticated models like Faster R-CNN and SSD, and covers tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "Preferred Netwo ... s, Tokyo, Japan", "Preferred Netwo ... s, Tokyo, Japan"], "authors": ["Yusuke Niitani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Niitani:Yusuke", "Toru Ogawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogawa:Toru", "Shunta Saito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saito:Shunta", "Masaki Saito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saito:Masaki"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
