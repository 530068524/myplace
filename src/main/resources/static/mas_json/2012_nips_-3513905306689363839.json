However, in many real world problems, there are significant dependencies in the variances or energies, which indicates that causality may possibly take place at the level of variances or energies. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic causal scale-mixture model with spatiotemporal variance dependencies to represent a specific type of generating mechanism of the observations. In particular, the causal mechanism including contemporaneous and temporal causal relations in variances or energies is represented by a Structural Vector AutoRegressive model (SVAR). We prove the identifiability of this model under the non-Gaussian assumption on the innovation processes. We also propose algorithms to estimate the involved parameters and discover the contemporaneous causal structure. Experiments on synthetic and real world data are conducted to show the applicability of the proposed model and algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Max Planck Society", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Zhitang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Zhitang", "Kun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Kun", "Laiwan Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Laiwan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
