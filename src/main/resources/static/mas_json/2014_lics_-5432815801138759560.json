Contrarily to Godel's original translation which translated  HA  into system  T , our presentation applies on untyped \u03bb-terms and features nicer proof-theoretical properties.   In the Curry-Howard perspective, we show that the computational behaviour of this translation can be accurately described by the explicit stack manipulation of the Krivine abstract machine, thus giving it a direct-style operational explanation.   Finally, we give direct evidence that supports the fact our presentation is quite relevant, by showing that we can apply it to the dependently-typed calculus of constructions with universes  CC  \u03c9  almost without any adaptation. This answers the question of the validity of Dialectica-like constructions in a dependent setting.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Univ Paris Dide ... , Paris, France"], "authors": ["Pierre-Marie P\u00e9drot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=eacute=drot:Pierre=Marie"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
