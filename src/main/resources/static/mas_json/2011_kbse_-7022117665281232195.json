{"title": "A rule-based approach to the semantic lifting of model differences in the context of model versioning.", "fields": ["model driven architecture", "model transformation", "merge", "software versioning", "configuration management"], "abstract": "In model-based software engineering, models are primary artifacts which iteratively evolve and which are often developed in teams. Therefore, comparison and merge tools for models are indispensable. These tools must compare models in a technology-dependent runtime representation and will initially derive low-level changes, which can differ considerably from user-level editing commands. Low-level differences are often incomprehensible and should be semantically lifted to the level of editing operations. This transformation of differences depends on the model type, supported editing operations, and user preferences; thus specific transformers are needed, and building them is a challenge. We present a rule-based approach to this problem: low-level differences are represented based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework. They are transformed into representations of editing operations using a rule-based model transformation engine. The necessary transformation rules are automatically derived from basic transformation rules for the editing operations.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["University of Siegen", "University of Siegen", "University of Marburg"], "authors": ["Timo Kehrer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kehrer:Timo", "Udo Kelter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kelter:Udo", "Gabriele Taentzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taentzer:Gabriele"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
