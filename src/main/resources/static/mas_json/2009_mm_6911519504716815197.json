{"title": "A compact, effective descriptor for video copy detection.", "fields": ["gloh", "graph", "computer experiment", "video copy detection", "indexation"], "abstract": "Large scale video copy detection tasks require a compact and computational-efficient descriptor that is robust to various transformations that are typically applied to generate copies. In this paper, we propose a new frame-level descriptor for such a task. The descriptor encodes the internal structure of a video frame by computing the pair-wise correlations between geometrically pre-indexed blocks. It is conceptually simple, small in size, and fast to compute. Experiments using the MUSCLE VCD benchmark show its superior performance compared to existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Mei-Chen Yeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yeh:Mei=Chen", "Kwang-Ting Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Kwang=Ting"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
