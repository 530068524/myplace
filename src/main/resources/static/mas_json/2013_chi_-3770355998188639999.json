Yet, the basic shape cannot be considered in isolation when interpreting the behavior of passers-by around such displays. In this paper we investigate two further display factors,  framedness  and  seamlessness , that have to be considered in conjunction with the form factor to understand user behavior in front of large non-flat displays. We present the findings from a field study with an  interactive column display  and take a closer look at how these factors influence actor and bystander behavior. Our results show that rectangular  frames  act as a sort of  funnel  for user position and can easily override effects of the non-flat shape on user position and interaction, even though the users didn't recall the presence of these frames.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Fraunhofer Society", "Fraunhofer Society", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "authors": ["Gilbert Beyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beyer:Gilbert", "Florian K\u00f6ttner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/K=ouml=ttner:Florian", "Manuel Schiewe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiewe:Manuel", "Ivo Haulsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haulsen:Ivo", "Andreas Butz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Butz:Andreas"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
