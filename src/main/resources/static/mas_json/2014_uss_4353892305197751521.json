{"title": "ROP is Still Dangerous: Breaking Modern Defenses.", "fields": ["legacy system", "return oriented programming", "vulnerability", "cloak", "control flow integrity"], "abstract": "Return Oriented Programming (ROP) has become the exploitation technique of choice for modern memory-safety vulnerability attacks. Recently, there have been multiple attempts at defenses to prevent ROP attacks. In this paper, we introduce three new attack methods that break many existing ROP defenses. Then we show how to break kBouncer and ROPecker, two recent low-overhead defenses that can be applied to legacy software on existing hardware. We examine several recent ROP attacks seen in the wild and demonstrate that our techniques successfully cloak them so they are not detected by these defenses. Our attacks apply to many CFI-based defenses which we argue are weaker than previously thought. Future defenses will need to take our attacks into account.", "citation": "Citations (215)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Nicholas Carlini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carlini:Nicholas", "David A.
