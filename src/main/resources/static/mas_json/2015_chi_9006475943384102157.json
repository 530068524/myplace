{"title": "Creating Sustainable Cyberinfrastructures.", "fields": ["actor network theory", "management science", "stakeholder", "qualitative research", "cyberinfrastructure"], "abstract": "In this paper we report the results of a qualitative research study of the GENI cyberinfrastructure: a program of four federated cyberinfrastructures. Drawing on theories of stakeholder positioning, we examine how different GENI stakeholders attempt to enlist new participants in the cyberinfrastructures of GENI, and leverage existing relationships to create sustainable infrastructure. This study contributes to our understanding of how cyberinfrastructures emerge over time through processes of stakeholder alignment, enrollment, and through synergies among stakeholder groups. We explore these issues to better understand how cyberinfrastructures can be designed to sustain over time.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["David P.
