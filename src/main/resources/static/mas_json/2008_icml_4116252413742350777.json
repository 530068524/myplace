The data collected at any time point are represented via a mixture associated with an appropriate underlying model, in the framework of HDP. The statistical properties of data collected at consecutive time points are linked via a random parameter that controls their probabilistic similarity. The sharing mechanisms of the time-evolving data are derived, and a relatively simple Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler is developed. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the model.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Lu Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Lu", "David B.
