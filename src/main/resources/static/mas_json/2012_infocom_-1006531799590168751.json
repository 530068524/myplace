However, many previous studies investigate content dissemination protocols that distribute a single object to as many users in an opportunistic mobile social network as possible without considering user preference. In this paper, we propose PrefCast, a preference-aware content dissemination protocol that targets on maximally satisfying user preference for content objects. Due to non-persistent connectivity between users in a mobile social network, when a user meets neighboring users for a limited contact duration, it needs to efficiently disseminate a suitable set of objects that can bring possible future contacts a high utility (the quantitative metric of preference satisfaction). We formulate such a problem as a maximum-utility forwarding model, and propose an algorithm that enables each user to predict how much utility it can contribute to future contacts and solve its optimal forwarding schedule in a distributed manner. Our trace-based evaluation shows that PrefCast can produce a 18.5% and 25.2% higher average utility than the protocols that only consider contact frequency or preference of local contacts, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica", "National Taiwan University"], "authors": ["Kate Ching-Ju Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Kate_Ching=Ju", "Chun-Wei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chun=Wei", "Cheng-Fu Chou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chou:Cheng=Fu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
