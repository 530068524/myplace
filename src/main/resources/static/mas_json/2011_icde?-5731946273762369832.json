{"title": "AMC - A framework for modelling and comparing matching systems as matching processes.", "fields": ["data visualization", "pattern matching", "ontology", "schema matching", "ontology alignment"], "abstract": "We present the Auto Mapping Core (AMC), a new framework that supports fast construction and tuning of schema matching approaches for specific domains such as ontology alignment, model matching or database-schema matching. Distinctive features of our framework are new visualisation techniques for modelling matching processes, stepwise tuning of parameters, intermediate result analysis and performance-oriented rewrites. Furthermore, existing matchers can be plugged into the framework to comparatively evaluate them in a common environment. This allows deeper analysis of behaviour and shortcomings in existing complex matching systems.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["Leipzig University", "SAP Research, 0 ... resden, Germany", "SAP Research, 0 ... resden, Germany"], "authors": ["Eric Peukert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peukert:Eric", "Julian Eberius.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eberius:Julian", "Erhard Rahm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahm:Erhard"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
