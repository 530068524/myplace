{"title": "Context by region ancestry.", "fields": ["contextual image classification", "segmentation", "discriminative model", "pixel", "context model"], "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new approach for modeling visual context. For this purpose, we consider the leaves of a hierarchical segmentation tree as elementary units. Each leaf is described by features of its ancestral set, the regions on the path linking the leaf to the root. We construct region trees by using a high-performance segmentation method. We then learn the importance of different descriptors (e.g. color, texture, shape) of the ancestors for classification. We report competitive results on the MSRC segmentation dataset and the MIT scene dataset, showing that region ancestry efficiently encodes information about discriminative parts, objects and scenes.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Joseph J.
