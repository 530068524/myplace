In this paper, we propose the task of restoring a portrait image from this process. As the first attempt along this line, we assume unknown global operations on human faces and aim to tackle the two issues of skin smoothing and skin color change. These two tasks, intriguingly, impose very different difficulties to estimate subtle details and major color variation. We propose a Component Regression Network (CRN) and address the limitation of using Euclidean loss in blind reversion. CRN maps the edited portrait images back to the original ones without knowing beautification operation details. Our experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the system for this novel task.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Adobe Systems", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ying-Cong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ying=Cong", "Xiaoyong Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xiaoyong", "Jiaya Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Jiaya"], "pages": 9}
