{"title": "Characterizing and detecting resource leaks in Android applications.", "fields": ["subroutine", "callback", "android", "crash", "experimental data"], "abstract": "Android phones come with a host of hardware components embedded in them, such as Camera, Media Player and Sensor. Most of these components are exclusive resources or resources consuming more memory/energy than general. And they should be explicitly released by developers. Missing release operations of these resources might cause serious problems such as performance degradation or system crash. These kinds of defects are called  resource leaks . This paper focuses on resource leak problems in Android apps, and presents our lightweight static analysis tool called  Relda , which can automatically analyze an application's resource operations and locate the resource leaks. We propose an automatic method for detecting resource leaks based on a modified Function Call Graph, which handles the features of event-driven mobile programming by analyzing the callbacks defined in Android framework. Our experimental data shows that Relda is effective in detecting resource leaks in real Android apps.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Chaorong Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Chaorong", "Jian Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Jian", "Jun Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan_0009:Jun", "Zhiqiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0007:Zhiqiang", "Yanli Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanli"], "pages": 10}
