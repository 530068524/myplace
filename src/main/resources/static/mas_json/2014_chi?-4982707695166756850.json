For navigation using a map while cycling in an urban environment, we studied two alternative solutions: smartphone display and projection on the road. This paper firstly demonstrates by proof-of-concept a GPS-based map navigation using a bike-mounted projector. Secondly, it implements a prototype using both a projector and a smartphone mounted on a bike, comparing them for use in a navigation system for nighttime cycling. Thirdly, it examines how visuo-spatial factors influence navigation. We believe that our findings will be useful for designing navigation systems for bikes and even for cars, helping cyclists and drivers be more attentive to their environment while navigating, and to provide useful information while moving.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Chalmers University of Technology", "Chalmers University of Technology", "Chalmers University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Alexandru Dancu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dancu:Alexandru", "Zlatko Franjcic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Franjcic:Zlatko", "Morten Fjeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fjeld:Morten"], "pages": 4}
