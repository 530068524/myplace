This paper reviews an already published study about the deployment of psychophysiological sensors in a stroke unit. The study exemplifies the difficulties to understand users' requirements first. By focusing on the technical challenges of measuring stress levels, researchers may neglect the real requirements of nurses and clinicians. During the study, it was found that the stroke unit staff were not interested in their stress levels but wanted to identify stressors that they can mitigate. This case study shows how, aside from technical challenges, researchers have to fully understand the complex nature of requirements in the context where the technology is applied.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego"], "authors": ["Lars M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:Lars"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
