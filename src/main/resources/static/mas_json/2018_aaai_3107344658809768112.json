FiLM layers influence neural network computation via a simple , feature-wise affine transformation based on conditioning information. We show that FiLM layers are highly effective for visual reasoning \u2014 answering image-related questions which require a multi-step, high-level process \u2014 a task which has proven difficult for standard deep learning methods that do not explicitly model reasoning. Specifically, we show on visual reasoning tasks that FiLM layers 1) halve state-of-the-art error for the CLEVR benchmark, 2) modulate features in a coherent manner, 3) are robust to ablations and architectural modifications, and 4) generalize well to challenging, new data from few examples or even zero-shot.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Rice University", "university of lille", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Ethan Perez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perez:Ethan", "Florian Strub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strub:Florian", "Harm de Vries.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vries:Harm_de", "Vincent Dumoulin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dumoulin:Vincent", "Aaron C.
