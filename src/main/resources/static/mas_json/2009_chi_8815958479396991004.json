{"title": "Fast gaze typing with an adjustable dwell time.", "fields": ["gaze", "word error rate", "dwell time", "words per minute", "typing"], "abstract": "Previous research shows that text entry by gaze using dwell time is slow, about 5-10 words per minute (wpm). These results are based on experiments with novices using a constant dwell time, typically between 450 and 1000 ms. We conducted a longitudinal study to find out how fast novices learn to type by gaze using an adjustable dwell time. Our results show that the text entry rate increased from 6.9 wpm in the first session to 19.9 wpm in the tenth session. Correspondingly, the dwell time decreased from an average of 876 ms to 282 ms, and the error rates decreased from 1.28% to .36%. The achieved typing speed of nearly 20 wpm is comparable with the result of 17.3 wpm achieved in an earlier, similar study with Dasher.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "departments": ["University of Tampere", "University of Tampere", "University of Tampere"], "authors": ["P\u00e4ivi Majaranta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majaranta:P=auml=ivi", "Ulla-Kaija Ahola.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahola:Ulla=Kaija", "Oleg Spakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spakov:Oleg"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
