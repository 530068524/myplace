This burst of interest from both the research community and the commercial world is due to the many database and data stream applications made possible by these extensions, including financial services, RFID-based inventory management, and electronic health systems. In this demo we will present the K*SQL system that represents a major step forward in this area. K*SQL supports a more expressive language that allows for generalized Kleene-closure queries and also achieves the expressive power of the nested word model, which greatly expands the application domain to include XML queries, software trace analysis, and genomics. In this demo, we first introduce the core features of our language in expressing complex pattern queries over both relational and XML data. We overview the architecture of our unifying engine and its user-friendly interfaces. We also present several K*SQL queries from stock market, XML, software trace analysis and genomic applications.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles", "University of California, Los Angeles"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Barzan Mozafari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mozafari:Barzan", "Kai Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng_0002:Kai", "Carlo Zaniolo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zaniolo:Carlo"], "pages": 4}
