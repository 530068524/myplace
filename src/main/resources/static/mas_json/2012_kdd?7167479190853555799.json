{"title": "Rank-loss support instance machines for MIML instance annotation.", "fields": ["instance based learning", "gradient descent", "hamming code", "annotation", "automatic image annotation"], "abstract": "Multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML) is a framework for supervised classification where the objects to be classified are bags of instances associated with multiple labels. For example, an image can be represented as a bag of segments and associated with a list of objects it contains. Prior work on MIML has focused on predicting label sets for previously unseen bags. We instead consider the problem of predicting instance labels while learning from data labeled only at the bag level. We propose Rank-Loss Support Instance Machines, which optimize a regularized rank-loss objective and can be instantiated with different aggregation models connecting instance-level predictions with bag-level predictions. The aggregation models that we consider are equivalent to defining a \"support instance\" for each bag, which allows efficient optimization of the rank-loss objective using primal sub-gradient descent. Experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show that the proposed methods achieve higher accuracy than other loss functions used in prior work, e.g., Hamming loss, and recent work in ambiguous label classification.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "Oregon State University", "Oregon State Un ... vallis, OR, USA"], "authors": ["Forrest Briggs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Briggs:Forrest", "Xiaoli Z.
