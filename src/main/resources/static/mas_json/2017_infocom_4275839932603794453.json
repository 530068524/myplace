Existing work focuses on the reachability. This paper proposes a framework that verifies the Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance of the network using static verification. This work proposes a quantitative model and a set of algorithms for verifying performance properties of a network with switches and middleboxes, i.e., service chains. We develop SLA-Verifier and evaluate its efficiency using simulation on real-world data and testbed experiments. To improve the SLA violation detection accuracy, our system uses verification results to optimize online monitoring.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Tsinghua University", "VMware", "Hewlett-Packard", "Hewlett-Packard"], "authors": ["Ying Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ying", "Wenfei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Wenfei", "Sujata Banerjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Banerjee:Sujata", "Joon-Myung Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Joon=Myung", "Mario A.
