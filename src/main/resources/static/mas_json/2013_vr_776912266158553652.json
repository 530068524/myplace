The name of the robot is \u201cshugo-robot\u201d, which is after \u201cshugo-rei (guardian spirit)\u201c. The shugo-robot follows her/his master by using laser sensors, and takes greeting behaviors by gazing to master's friend and others. Thus, he/she is a communication agent on behalf of master. The head part of the robot has a camera, and finds human faces. Then, the robot's face gazes at a person nearest to the robot. This behavior makes users to believe the robot has an intention to communicate with them. The robot makes blinking at random timings to show the robot is alive, and several facial expressions to show her/his feelings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Toyohashi University of Technology", "Toyohashi University of Technology", "Toyohashi University of Technology", "Toyohashi University of Technology", "Toyohashi University of Technology"], "authors": ["Yuta Murofushi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murofushi:Yuta", "Natsumi Isobe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isobe:Natsumi", "Ryosuke Tasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tasaki:Ryosuke", "Kazuhiko Terashima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Terashima:Kazuhiko", "Michiteru Kitazaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kitazaki:Michiteru"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
