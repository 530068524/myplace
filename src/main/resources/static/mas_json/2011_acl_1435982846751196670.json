We develop a novel hidden Markov model incorporating sophisticated smoothing using a hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes prior, providing an elegant and principled means of incorporating lexical characteristics. Central to our approach is a new type-based sampling algorithm for hierarchical Pitman-Yor models in which we track fractional table counts. In an empirical evaluation we show that our model consistently out-performs the current state-of-the-art across 10 languages.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Sheffield"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Phil Blunsom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blunsom:Phil", "Trevor Cohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohn:Trevor"], "pages": 10}
