{"title": "Web-Based Semantic Fragment Discovery for On-Line Lingual-Visual Similarity.", "fields": ["image retrieval", "web application", "the internet", "density estimation", "sentence"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present an automatic approach for on-line discovery of visual-lingual semantic fragments from weakly labeled Internet images. Instead of learning region-entity correspondences from well-labeled image-sentence pairs, our approach directly collects and enhances the weakly labeled visual contents from the Web and constructs an adaptive visual representation which automatically links generic lingual phrases to their related visual contents. To ensure reliable and efficient semantic discovery, we adopt non-parametric density estimation to re-rank the related visual instances and proposed a fast self-similarity-based quality assessment method to identify the high-quality semantic fragments. The discovered semantic fragments provide an adaptive joint representation for texts and images, based on which lingual-visual similarity can be defined for further co-analysis of heterogeneous multimedia data. Experimental results on semantic fragment quality assessment, sentence-based image retrieval, automatic multimedia insertion and ordering demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experiments show that the proposed methods can make effective use of the Web knowledge, and are able to generate competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches in various tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Xiaoshuai Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Xiaoshuai", "Jiewei Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Jiewei", "Chao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chao", "Lei Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Lei", "Heng Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Heng_Tao"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
