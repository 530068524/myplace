This paper presents PALOMA, a novel client-centric technique for reducing the network latency by prefetching HTTP requests in Android apps. Our work leverages string analysis and callback control-flow analysis to automatically instrument apps using PALOMA's rigorous formulation of scenarios that address \"what\" and \"when\" to prefetch. PALOMA has been shown to incur significant runtime savings (several hundred milliseconds per prefetchable HTTP request), both when applied on a reusable evaluation benchmark we have developed and on real applications.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California"], "authors": ["Yixue Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yixue", "Marcelo Schmitt Laser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laser:Marcelo_Schmitt", "Yingjun Lyu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyu:Yingjun", "Nenad Medvidovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Medvidovic:Nenad"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2018", "pages": 11}
