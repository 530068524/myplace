Removing distractors\u2014for example, using in-painting \u2014 can improve the composition of an image. In this work we created two datasets of images with user annotations to identify the characteristics of distractors. We use these datasets to train an algorithm to predict distractor maps. Finally, we use our predictor to automatically enhance images.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Princeton University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ohad Fried.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fried:Ohad", "Eli Shechtman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shechtman:Eli", "Dan B.
