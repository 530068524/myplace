DCN design is especially difficult when expanding an existing network, because traditional DCN design places strict constraints on the topology (e.g., a fat-tree). Recent advances in routing protocols allow data center servers to fully utilize arbitrary networks, so there is no need to require restricted, regular topologies in the data center. Therefore, we propose a data center network design framework, that we call REWIRE, to design networks using an optimization algorithm. Our algorithm finds a network with maximal bisection bandwidth and minimal end-to-end latency while meeting user-defined constraints and accurately modeling the predicted cost of the network. We evaluate REWIRE on a wide range of inputs and find that it significantly outperforms previous solutions\u2014its network designs have up to 100\u2013500% more bisection bandwidth and less end-to-end network latency than equivalent-cost DCNs built with best practices.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Andrew R.
