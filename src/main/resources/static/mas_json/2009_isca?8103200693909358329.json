{"title": "Spatio-temporal memory streaming.", "fields": ["stride", "exploit", "bottleneck", "chip", "spatial correlation"], "abstract": "Recent research advocates memory streaming techniques to alleviate the performance bottleneck caused by the high latencies of off-chip memory accesses. Temporal memory streaming replays previously observed miss sequences to eliminate long chains of dependent misses. Spatial memory streaming predicts repetitive data layout patterns within fixed-size memory regions. Because each technique targets a different subset of misses, their effectiveness varies across workloads and each leaves a significant fraction of misses unpredicted.   In this paper, we propose Spatio-Temporal Memory Streaming (STeMS) to exploit the synergy between spatial and temporal streaming. We observe that the order of spatial accesses repeats both within and across regions. STeMS records and replays the temporal sequence of region accesses and uses spatial relationships within each region to dynamically reconstruct a predicted total miss order. Using trace-driven and cycle-accurate simulation across a suite of commercial workloads, we demonstrate that with similar implementation complexity as temporal streaming, STeMS achieves equal or higher coverage than spatial or temporal memory streaming alone, and improves performance by 31%, 3%, and 18% over stride, spatial, and temporal prediction, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (115)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Michigan", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Stephen Somogyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Somogyi:Stephen", "Thomas F.
