Sensors and technical systems can augment the performance of fire fighters to increase safety and efficiency during operation. An important aspect in that context is the awareness of location, structure and thermal properties of the environment.   This paper focuses on the design and development of a mobile system, which can reconstruct a 3d model of a building's interior structure in real-time and fuses the visualization with the image of a thermal camera. In addition the position and viewing direction of the fire fighter within the model is determined and a thermal map can be generated from the gathered data, which could help an operational commander to guide his men during a mission.   First tests with our system in different situations showed good results, being able to reconstruct different larger scenes and create thermal maps thereof.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Christian Sch\u00f6nauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=nauer:Christian", "Emanuel Vonach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vonach:Emanuel", "Georg Gerstweiler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gerstweiler:Georg", "Hannes Kaufmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufmann:Hannes"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
