We show that they can efficiently recover low-rank tensors. In particular, they enjoy exact guarantees similar to those known for minimizing ||\u03c7||* under the conditions on the sensing operator such as its null-space property, restricted isometry property, or spherical section property. To recover a low-rank tensor \u03c70, minimizing ||\u03c7||* + 1/2\u03b1||\u03c7||F2 returns the same solution as minimizing ||\u03c7||* almost whenever \u03b1 \u2265 10 max i ||X(i)0||2.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Harbin Institute of Technology", "Beijing GuoDian ...
