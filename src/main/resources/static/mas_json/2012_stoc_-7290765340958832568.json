This includes the OR function, solvable by the Grover algorithm, the element distinctness, the triangle and other problems. The usual way to solve them is by quantum walk on the Johnson graph. We propose a solution for the same problems using span programs. The span program is a computational model equivalent to the quantum query algorithm in its strength, and yet very different in its outfit.   We prove the power of our approach by designing a quantum algorithm for the triangle problem with query complexity O( n  35/27 ) that is better than O( n  13/10 ) of the best previously known algorithm by Magniez  et al.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Latvia"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Aleksandrs Belovs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belovs:Aleksandrs"], "pages": 8}
