Social Media Observer.", "fields": ["social media", "web crawler", "dashboard", "observer", "crisis management"], "abstract": "The observation of social media provides an important complementing source of information about an unfolding event such as a crisis situation. For this purpose we have developed and demonstrate Sover!, a system to monitor real-time dynamic events via Twitter targeting the needs of aid organizations. At its core it builds upon an effective adaptive crawler, which combines two social media streams in a Bayesian inference framework and after each time-window updates the probabilities of whether given keywords are relevant for an event. Sover! also exposes the crawling functionality so a user can actively influence the evolving selection of keywords. The crawling activity feeds a rich dashboard, which enables the user to get a better understanding of a crisis situation as it unfolds in real-time.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany", "Interdisciplina ... urg, Luxembourg", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany"], "authors": ["Asmelash Teka Hadgu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hadgu:Asmelash_Teka", "Sallam Abualhaija.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abualhaija:Sallam", "Claudia Nieder\u00e9e.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nieder=eacute=e:Claudia"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
