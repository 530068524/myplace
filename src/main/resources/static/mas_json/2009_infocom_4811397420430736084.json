{"title": "Performance Comparison of Weather Disruption-Tolerant Cross-Layer Routing Algorithms.", "fields": ["wireless mesh network", "open shortest path first", "backhaul", "link state routing protocol", "network layer"], "abstract": "With growing demand for high-speed access to mobile handheld devices, there is a significant cost benefit in deploying fixed wireless-mesh networks for backhaul access. However, enabling reliable broadband access over high-frequency radios (such as millimeter-wave networks) posses a fundamental challenge due to weather disruptions in general and rain attenuation in particular. In this paper, we present an analysis of the impact of precipitation on millimeter-wave mesh networks based on radar measurements of real storms in the Midwest US. Furthermore, we compare two novel algorithms that use physical-layer information to optimize routing at the network layer: P-WARP (Predictive Weather-Assisted Routing Protocol) and XL-OSPF (Cross-Layered Open Shortest Path First). Finally, we present simulation studies to compare the performance of the proposed protocols and evaluate the dependability of the end-user service during weather disruptions.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["University of Kansas", "University of Kansas", "University of Kansas", "University of Kansas", "University of Kansas"], "authors": ["Abdul Jabbar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jabbar:Abdul", "Justin P.
