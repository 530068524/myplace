{"title": "Dynamic Service Detection for Automated Patient Selection for Study Recruitment Purposes.", "fields": ["graphical user interface", "query rewriting", "data modeling", "service oriented architecture", "terminology"], "abstract": "ICT-enabled automated processes facilitating subject recruitment in clinical trials is a hot topic in the clinical research domain. However, the successful detection of candidate subjects across patient records of different healthcare providers requires dealing with a variety of issues, including but not limited to different terminologies and structures as well as missing patient data. In this work a novel system for automated patient selection for study recruitment purposes is being presented. The system is based on the dynamic service detection for eligibility criteria evaluation, while the patient data retrieved from each healthcare entity are further processed for clinical research purposes. The presented system is also compared with a different framework that we have already developed in the past that is based on query rewriting and translation for eligibility criteria evaluation purposes. The advantages and limitations of the two aforementioned approaches are being discussed as well as their potential combination for automated patient selection.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens"], "authors": ["Efthymios Chondrogiannis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chondrogiannis:Efthymios", "Vassiliki Andronikou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andronikou:Vassiliki", "Efstathios Karanastasis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karanastasis:Efstathios", "Theodora A.
