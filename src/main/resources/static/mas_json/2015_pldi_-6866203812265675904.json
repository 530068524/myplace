{"title": "Peer-to-peer affine commitment using bitcoin.", "fields": ["cryptocurrency", "commit", "executable", "affine transformation", "affine logic"], "abstract": "The power of linear and affine logic lies in their ability to model state change. However, in a trustless, peer-to-peer setting, it is difficult to force principals to commit to state changes. We show how to solve the peer-to-peer affine commitment problem using a generalization of Bitcoin in which transactions deal in types rather than numbers. This has applications to proof-carrying authorization and mechanically executable contracts. Importantly, our system can be---and is---implemented on top of the existing Bitcoin network, so there is no need to recruit computing power to a new protocol.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Karl Crary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crary:Karl", "Michael J.
