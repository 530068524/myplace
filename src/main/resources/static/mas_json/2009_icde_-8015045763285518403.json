In the real world, however, there are many physical obstacles (e.g., buildings, blindages, etc.), and their presence may affect the visibility/distance between two objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel variant of RNN queries, namely visible reverse nearest neighbor (VRNN) search, which considers the obstacle influence on the visibility of objects. Given a data set P, an obstacle set O, and a query point q, a VRNN query retrieves the points in P that have q as their nearest neighbor and are visible to q. We propose an efficient algorithm for VRNN query processing, assuming that both P and O are indexed by R-trees. Our method does not require any pre-processing, and employs half-plane property and visibility check to prune the search space.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Singapore Manag ... niv., Singapore", "Singapore Manag ... niv., Singapore"], "authors": ["Yunjun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yunjun", "Baihua Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Baihua", "Gencai Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Gencai", "Wang-Chien Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wang=Chien", "Ken C.
