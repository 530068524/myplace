A technique using three miniature wearable accelerometers is presented that improves upon state-of-the-art energy expenditure (EE) estimation. On a dataset acquired from 24 subjects performing gym and household activities, we demonstrate how knowledge of activity type, which can be automatically inferred from the accelerometer data, can improve EE estimates by more than 15% when compared to the best estimates from other methods.", "citation": "Citations (132)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Fahd Albinali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albinali:Fahd", "Stephen S.
