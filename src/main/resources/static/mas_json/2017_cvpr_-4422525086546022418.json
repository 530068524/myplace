{"title": "Group-Wise Point-Set Registration Based on R\u00e9nyi's Second Order Entropy.", "fields": ["transfer entropy", "binary entropy function", "transformation", "maximum entropy probability distribution", "point set registration"], "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a set of robust algorithms for group-wise registration using both rigid and non-rigid transformations of multiple unlabelled point-sets with no bias toward a given set. These methods mitigate the need to establish a correspondence among the point-sets by representing them as probability density functions where the registration is treated as a multiple distribution alignment. Holders and Jensens inequalities provide a notion of similarity/distance among point-sets and R\u00e9nyis second order entropy yields a closed-form solution to the cost function and update equations. We also show that the methods can be improved by normalizing the entropy with a scale factor. These provide simple, fast and accurate algorithms to compute the spatial transformation function needed to register multiple point-sets. The algorithms are compared against two well-known methods for group-wise point-set registration. The results show an improvement in both accuracy and computational complexity.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Luis Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez Giraldo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giraldo:Luis_Gonzalo_S=aacute=nchez", "Erion Hasanbelliu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasanbelliu:Erion", "Murali Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Murali", "Jos\u00e9 C.
