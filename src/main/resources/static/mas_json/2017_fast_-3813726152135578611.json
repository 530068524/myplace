Mirador is able to encode multi-dimensional placement goals relating to the performance, failure response, and workload adaptation of the storage system. Using approaches from dynamic constraint satisfaction, Mirador migrates both data and client network connections in order to continuously adapt and improve the configuration of the storage system.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Coho Data", "Coho Data"], "authors": ["Jake Wires.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wires:Jake", "Andrew Warfield.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Warfield:Andrew"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2017", "pages": 16}
