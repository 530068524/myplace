{"title": "Neural Audio Synthesis of Musical Notes with WaveNet Autoencoders.", "fields": ["musical notation", "autoencoder", "raw audio format", "morphing", "timbre"], "abstract": "Generative models in vision have seen rapid progress due to algorithmic improvements and the availability of high-quality image datasets. In this paper, we offer contributions in both these areas to enable similar progress in audio modeling. First, we detail a powerful new WaveNet-style autoencoder model that conditions an autoregressive decoder on temporal codes learned from the raw audio waveform. Second, we introduce NSynth, a large-scale and high-quality dataset of musical notes that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable public datasets. Using NSynth, we demonstrate improved qualitative and quantitative performance of the WaveNet autoencoder over a well-tuned spectral autoencoder baseline. Finally, we show that the model learns a manifold of embeddings that allows for morphing between instruments, meaningfully interpolating in timbre to create new types of sounds that are realistic and expressive.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Baidu", "Google", "Ghent University", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jesse Engel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Engel:Jesse", "Cinjon Resnick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Resnick:Cinjon", "Adam Roberts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roberts:Adam", "Sander Dieleman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dieleman:Sander", "Mohammad Norouzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norouzi_0002:Mohammad", "Douglas Eck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eck:Douglas", "Karen Simonyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simonyan:Karen"], "pages": 10}
