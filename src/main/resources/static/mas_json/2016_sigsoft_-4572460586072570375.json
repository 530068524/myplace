{"title": "PUMConf: a tool to configure product specific use case and domain models in a product line.", "fields": ["line management", "use case analysis", "use case diagram", "domain analysis", "domain engineering"], "abstract": "We present PUMConf, a tool for supporting configuration that currently focuses on requirements and enables effective product line management in the context of use case-driven development. By design, it relies exclusively on variability modeling for artifacts that are commonly used in such contexts (i.e., use case diagram, specifications and domain model). For given Product Line (PL) use case and domain models, PUMConf checks the consistency of the models, interactively receives configuration decisions from analysts, automatically checks decision consistency, and generates Product Specific (PS) use case and domain models from the PL models and decisions. It has been evaluated on an industrial case study in the automotive domain.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "IEE, Luxembourg"], "conf": "sigsoft", "authors": ["Ines Hajri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hajri:Ines", "Arda Goknil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goknil:Arda", "Lionel C.
