{"title": "Toward Automated Detection of Logic Vulnerabilities in Web Applications.", "fields": ["scripting language", "secure coding", "sql injection", "data validation", "web modeling"], "abstract": "Web applications are the most common way to make services and data available on the Internet. Unfortunately, with the increase in the number and complexity of these applications, there has also been an increase in the number and complexity of vulnerabilities. Current techniques to identify security problems in web applications have mostly focused on input validation flaws, such as crosssite scripting and SQL injection, with much less attention devoted to application logic vulnerabilities.\n\nApplication logic vulnerabilities are an important class of defects that are the result of faulty application logic. These vulnerabilities are specific to the functionality of particular web applications, and, thus, they are extremely difficult to characterize and identify. In this paper, we propose a first step toward the automated detection of application logic vulnerabilities. To this end, we first use dynamic analysis and observe the normal operation of a web application to infer a simple set of behavioral specifications. Then, leveraging the knowledge about the typical execution paradigm of web applications, we filter the learned specifications to reduce false positives, and we use model checking over symbolic input to identify program paths that are likely to violate these specifications under specific conditions, indicating the presence of a certain type of web application logic flaws. We developed a tool, called Waler, based on our ideas, and we applied it to a number of web applications, finding previously-unknown logic vulnerabilities.", "citation": "Citations (199)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Viktoria Felmetsger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felmetsger:Viktoria", "Ludovico Cavedon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cavedon:Ludovico", "Christopher Kruegel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kruegel:Christopher", "Giovanni Vigna.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vigna:Giovanni"], "pages": 18}
