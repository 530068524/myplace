However, computing CCA for huge datasets can be very slow since it involves implementing QR decomposition or singular value decomposition of huge matrices. In this paper we introduce L-CCA , a iterative algorithm which can compute CCA fast on huge sparse datasets. Theory on both the asymptotic convergence and finite time accuracy of L-CCA are established. The experiments also show that L-CCA outperform other fast CCA approximation schemes on two real datasets.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yichao Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yichao", "Dean P.
