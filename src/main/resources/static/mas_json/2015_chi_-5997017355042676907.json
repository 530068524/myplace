We conducted an experiment to investigate what characteristics of eye-wearable technology impact user performance in machine maintenance, which included a representative set of car maintenance tasks involving Locate, Manipulate, and Compare actions. Participants were asked to follow instructions displayed on one of four technologies: a peripheral eye-wearable display, a central eye-wearable display, a tablet, or a paper manual. We found a significant effect of display position: the peripheral eye-wearable display resulted in longer completion time than the central display; but no effect for hands-free operation. The technology effects were also modulated by different Tasks and Action types. We discuss the human factors implications for designing more effective eye-wearable technology, including display position, issues of monocular display, and how the physical proximity of the technology affects users' reliance level.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Xianjun Sam Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Xianjun_Sam", "C\u00e9dric Foucault.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Foucault:C=eacute=dric", "Patrik Matos da Silva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silva:Patrik_Matos_da", "Siddharth Dasari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dasari:Siddharth", "Tao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Tao", "Stuart Goose.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goose:Stuart"], "pages": 10}
