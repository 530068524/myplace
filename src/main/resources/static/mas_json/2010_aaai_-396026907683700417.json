In such situations, agents' individual preferences over available alternatives may vary, and they may try to reconcile these differences by voting. Based on the fact that agents may have incentives to vote strategically and misreport their real preferences, a number of recent papers have explored different possibilities for avoiding or eliminating such manipulations. In contrast to most prior work, this paper focuses on convergence of strategic behavior to a decision from which no voter will want to deviate. We consider scenarios where voters cannot coordinate their actions, but are allowed to change their vote after observing the current outcome. We focus on the Plurality voting rule, and study the conditions under which this iterative game is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium (i.e., to a decision that is stable against further unilateral manipulations). We show for the first time how convergence depends on the exact attributes of the game, such as the tie-breaking scheme, and on assumptions regarding agents' weights and strategies.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "University of Southampton", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "University of Southampton"], "authors": ["Reshef Meir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meir:Reshef", "Maria Polukarov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polukarov:Maria", "Jeffrey S.
