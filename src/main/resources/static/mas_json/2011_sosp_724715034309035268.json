{"title": "Software fault isolation with API integrity and multi-principal modules.", "fields": ["sysfs", "configfs", "hybrid kernel", "kernel preemption", "procfs"], "abstract": "The security of many applications relies on the kernel being secure, but history suggests that kernel vulnerabilities are routinely discovered and exploited. In particular, exploitable vulnerabilities in kernel modules are common. This paper proposes LXFI, a system which isolates kernel modules from the core kernel so that vulnerabilities in kernel modules cannot lead to a privilege escalation attack. To safely give kernel modules access to complex kernel APIs, LXFI introduces the notion of  API integrity , which captures the set of contracts assumed by an interface. To partition the privileges within a shared module, LXFI introduces  module principals . Programmers specify principals and API integrity rules through capabilities and annotations. Using a compiler plugin, LXFI instruments the generated code to grant, check, and transfer capabilities between modules, according to the programmer's annotations. An evaluation with Linux shows that the annotations required on kernel functions to support a new module are moderate, and that LXFI is able to prevent three known privilege-escalation vulnerabilities. Stress tests of a network driver module also show that isolating this module using LXFI does not hurt TCP throughput but reduces UDP throughput by 35%, and increases CPU utilization by 2.2-3.7x.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Tsinghua University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yandong Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Yandong", "Haogang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Haogang", "Dong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Dong", "Xi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xi", "Nickolai Zeldovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeldovich:Nickolai", "M.
