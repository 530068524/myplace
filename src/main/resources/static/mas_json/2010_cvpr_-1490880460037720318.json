We demonstrate that human body can be considered as a calibration target thus avoiding special calibration objects or manually established fiducial points. First, by assuming roughly parallel human poses we derive a new constraint which allows to formulate the calibration of internal and external camera parameters as a Quadratic Eigenvalue Problem. Secondly, we couple the calibration with an improved effective integral contour based human detector and use 3D projected models to capture a large variety of person and camera mutual positions. The resulting camera auto-calibration method is very robust and efficient, and thus well suited for surveillance applications where the camera calibration process cannot use special calibration targets and must be simple.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Austrian Institute of Technology", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Branislav Micus\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Micus=iacute=k:Branislav", "Tom\u00e1s Pajdla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pajdla:Tom=aacute=s"], "pages": 8}
