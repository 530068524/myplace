{"title": "Data flow testing of service choreography.", "fields": ["xpath", "choreography", "service choreography", "orchestration", "xml schema"], "abstract": "Service computing has increasingly been adopted by the industry, developing business applications by means of orchestration and choreography. Choreography specifies how services collaborate with one another by defining, say, the message exchange, rather than via the process flow as in the case of orchestration. Messages sent from one service to another may require the use of different XPaths to manipulate or extract message contents. Mismatches in XML manipulations through XPaths (such as to relate incoming and outgoing messages in choreography specifications) may result in failures. In this paper, we propose to associate XPath Rewriting Graphs (XRGs), a structure that relates XPath and XML schema, with actions of choreography applications that are skeletally modeled as labeled transition systems. We develop the notion of XRG patterns to capture how different XRGs are related even though they may refer to different XML schemas or their tags. By applying XRG patterns, we successfully identify new data flow associations in choreography applications and develop new data flow testing criteria. Finally, we report an empirical case study that evaluates our techniques. The result shows our techniques are promising in detecting failures in choreography applications.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Lijun Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Lijun", "W.
