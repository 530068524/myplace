In this work, we propose and theoretically analyze new parallel algorithms for computing the LCP array given the suffix array as input. Most of our algorithms have a work and depth (parallel time) complexity related to the LCP values of the input. We also present a slight variation of Karkkainen and Sanders' skew algorithm that requires linear work and poly-logarithmic depth in the worst case. We present a comprehensive experimental study of our parallel algorithms along with existing parallel and sequential LCP algorithms. On a variety of real-world and artificial strings, we show that on a 40-core shared-memory machine our fastest algorithm is up to 2.3 times faster than the fastest existing parallel algorithm, and up to 21.8 times faster than the fastest sequential LCP algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Julian Shun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shun:Julian"], "pages": 12}
