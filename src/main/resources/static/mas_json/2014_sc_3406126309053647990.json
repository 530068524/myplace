{"title": "A Computation- and Communication-Optimal Parallel Direct 3-Body Algorithm.", "fields": ["scaling", "cutoff", "nested loop join", "latency", "bounded function"], "abstract": "Traditional particle simulation methods are used to calculate pairwise potentials, but some problems require 3-body potentials that calculate over triplets of particles. A direct calculation of 3-body interactions involves  O ( n  3 ) interactions, but has significant redundant computations that occur in a nested loop formulation. In this paper we explore algorithms for 3-body computations that simultaneously optimize three criteria: computation minimization through symmetries, communication optimality, and load balancing. We present a new 3-body algorithm that is both communication and computation optimal. Its optional replication factor,  c , saves  c  3  in latency (number of messages) and  c  2  in bandwidth (volume), with bounded load-imbalance. We also consider the k-body case and discuss an algorithm that is optimal if there is a cutoff distance of less than 1/3 of the domain. The 3-body algorithm demonstrates 99% efficiency on tens of thousands of cores, showing strong scaling properties with order of magnitude speedups over the naive algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Penporn Koanantakool.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koanantakool:Penporn", "Katherine A.
