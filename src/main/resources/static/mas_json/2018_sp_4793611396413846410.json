Unfortunately, existing constructions remain very expensive. This paper introduces two techniques that make the computational variant of PIR (CPIR) more efficient in practice. The first technique targets a recent class of CPU-efficient CPIR protocols where the query sent by the client contains a number of ciphertexts proportional to the size of the database. We show how to compresses this query, achieving size reductions of up to 274X. The second technique is a new data encoding called probabilistic batch codes (PBCs). We use PBCs to build a multi query PIR scheme that allows the server to amortize its computational cost when processing a batch of requests from the same client. This technique achieves up to 40\u00d7 speedup over processing queries one at a time, and is significantly more efficient than related encodings. We apply our techniques to the Pung private communication system, which relies on a custom multi-query CPIR protocol for its privacy guarantees. By porting our techniques to Pung, we find that we can simultaneously reduce network costs by 36\u00d7 and increase throughput by 3X.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of California, Davis", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Sebastian Angel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angel:Sebastian", "Hao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Hao", "Kim Laine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laine:Kim", "Srinath T.
