To explore solutions to this problem, we designed Physio@Home, a prototype that guides people through prerecorded physiotherapy exercises using real-time visual guides and multi-camera views. Our design addresses several aspects of corrective guidance, including: plane and range of movement, joint positions and angles, and extent of movement. We evaluated our design, com-paring how closely people could follow exercise movements under various feedback conditions. Participants were most accurate when using our visual guide and multi-views. We provide suggestions for exercise guidance systems drawn from qualitative findings on visual feedback complexity.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary", "University of Prince Edward Island", "INESC-ID", "University of Calgary"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Richard Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Richard", "Xing-Dong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xing=Dong", "Scott Bateman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bateman:Scott", "Joaquim A.
