We demonstrate  RACE , a novel framework and system for specifying and efficiently executing distributed real-time applications in the Cloud-Edge topology.  RACE  uses  LINQ  for StreamInsight to succinctly express a diverse suite of useful real-time applications. Further, it exploits the processing power of edge devices and the Cloud to partition and execute such queries in a distributed manner.  RACE  features a novel cost-based optimizer that efficiently finds the optimal placement, minimizing global communication cost while handling multi-level join queries and asymmetric network links.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "University of Pennsylvania"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Badrish Chandramouli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chandramouli:Badrish", "Joris Claessens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Claessens:Joris", "Suman Nath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nath:Suman", "Ivo Santos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santos:Ivo", "Wenchao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Wenchao"], "pages": 4}
