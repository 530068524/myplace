Here we extend them by proving asymptotic optimality of the algorithm using the Jeffreys prior for 1-dimensional exponential family bandits. Our proof builds on previous work, but also makes extensive use of closed forms for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information (through the Jeffreys prior) available in an exponential family. This allow us to give a finite time exponential concentration inequality for posterior distributions on exponential families that may be of interest in its own right. Moreover our analysis covers some distributions for which no optimistic algorithm has yet been proposed, including heavy-tailed exponential families.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Nathaniel Korda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Korda:Nathaniel", "Emilie Kaufmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaufmann:Emilie", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
