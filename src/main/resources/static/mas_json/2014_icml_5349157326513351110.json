{"title": "A Consistent Histogram Estimator for Exchangeable Graph Models.", "fields": ["network model", "mathematical object", "estimator", "compressed sensing", "histogram"], "abstract": "Exchangeable graph models (ExGM) subsume a number of popular network models. The mathematical object that characterizes an ExGM is termed a graphon. Finding scalable estimators of graphons, provably consistent, remains an open issue. In this paper, we propose a histogram estimator of a graphon that is provably consistent and numerically efficient. The proposed estimator is based on a sorting-and-smoothing (SAS) algorithm, which first sorts the empirical degree of a graph, then smooths the sorted graph using total variation minimization. The consistency of the SAS algorithm is proved by leveraging sparsity concepts from compressed sensing.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Harvard University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Stanley H.
