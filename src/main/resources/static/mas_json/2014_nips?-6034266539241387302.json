{"title": "The Large Margin Mechanism for Differentially Private Maximization.", "fields": ["mathematical optimization", "machine learning", "maximization", "artificial intelligence", "differential privacy"], "abstract": "A basic problem in the design of privacy-preserving algorithms is the private maximization problem: the goal is to pick an item from a universe that (approximately) maximizes a data-dependent function, all under the constraint of differential privacy. This problem has been used as a sub-routine in many privacy-preserving algorithms for statistics and machine learning.\n\nPrevious algorithms for this problem are either range-dependent\u2014i.e., their utility diminishes with the size of the universe\u2014or only apply to very restricted function classes. This work provides the first general purpose, range-independent algorithm for private maximization that guarantees approximate differential privacy. Its applicability is demonstrated on two fundamental tasks in data mining and machine learning.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "Columbia University", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Kamalika Chaudhuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaudhuri:Kamalika", "Daniel J.
