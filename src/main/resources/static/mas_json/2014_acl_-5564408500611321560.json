The algorithm relies on two steps: first, the use of a matrix-decomposition algorithm applied to a co-occurrence matrix estimated from the parse trees in a training sample; second, the use of EM applied to a convex objective derived from the training samples in combination with the output from the matrix decomposition. Experiments on parsing and a language modeling problem show that the algorithm is efficient and effective in practice.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Columbia University", "School of Informatics", "School of Informatics"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Shay B.
