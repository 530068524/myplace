Specifically, we present the first non-trivial lower bounds for this problem by showing that deterministic online algorithms have a competitive ratio of at least \u03a9(\u221a{log k/log log k}) and randomized online algorithms have a competitive ratio of at least \u03a9(log log k), where k denotes the size of the buffer.   We complement this by presenting a deterministic online algorithm for the reordering buffer management problem that obtains a competitive ratio of O(\u221alog k), almost matching the lower bound. This improves upon an algorithm by Avigdor-Elgrabli and Rabani (SODA 2010) that achieves a competitive ratio of O(log k/ log log k).", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Warwick", "University of Warwick", "University of Warwick", "University of Warwick"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anna Adamaszek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adamaszek:Anna", "Artur Czumaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Czumaj:Artur", "Matthias Englert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Englert:Matthias", "Harald R\u00e4cke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=auml=cke:Harald"], "pages": 10}
