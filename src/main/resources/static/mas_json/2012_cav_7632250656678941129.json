SAFARI is based on an extension of lazy abstraction capable of handling existentially quantified formulae for symbolically representing states. A heuristics, called term abstraction, favors the convergence of the tool by \"tuning\" interpolants and guessing additional quantified variables of invariants to prune the search space efficiently.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Lugano", "University of Milan", "University of Milan", "University of Lugano", "FBK-Irst, Trento, Italy"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Francesco Alberti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alberti:Francesco", "Roberto Bruttomesso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruttomesso:Roberto", "Silvio Ghilardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghilardi:Silvio", "Silvio Ranise.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranise:Silvio", "Natasha Sharygina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharygina:Natasha"], "pages": 7}
