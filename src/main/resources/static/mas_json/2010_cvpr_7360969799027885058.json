{"title": "Discrete minimum ratio curves and surfaces.", "fields": ["differential geometry", "curve fitting", "cut", "discrete differential geometry", "global optimization"], "abstract": "Graph cuts have proven useful for image segmentation and for volumetric reconstruction in multiple view stereo. However, solutions are biased: the cost function tends to favour either a short boundary (in 2D) or a boundary with a small area (in 3D). This bias can be avoided by instead minimising the cut ratio, which normalises the cost by a measure of the boundary size. This paper uses ideas from discrete differential geometry to develop a linear programming formulation for finding a minimum ratio cut in arbitrary dimension, which allows constraints on the solution to be specified in a natural manner, and which admits an efficient and globally optimal solution. Results are shown for 2D segmentation and for 3D volumetric reconstruction.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Cape Town", "Oxford Brookes University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Fred Nicolls.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nicolls:Fred", "Philip H.
