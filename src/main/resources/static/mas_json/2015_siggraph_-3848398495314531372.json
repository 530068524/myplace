They can give us insights into how people feel and think. There are a number of works related to facial expression detection in computer vision. However, most works focus on camera-based systems installed in the environment. With this method, it is difficult to track user's face if user moves constantly. Moreover, user's facial expression can be recognized at only a limited place.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Keio University", "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "Keio University", "Keio University", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Katsutoshi Masai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masai:Katsutoshi", "Yuta Sugiura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugiura:Yuta", "Masa Ogata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ogata:Masa", "Katsuhiro Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Katsuhiro", "Fumihiko Nakamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakamura:Fumihiko", "Sho Shimamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shimamura:Sho", "Kai Kunze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kunze:Kai", "Masahiko Inami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inami:Masahiko", "Maki Sugimoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugimoto:Maki"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
