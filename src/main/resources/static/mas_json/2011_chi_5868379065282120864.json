{"title": "Teenagers and their virtual possessions: design opportunities and issues.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "multimedia", "social network", "computer science"], "abstract": "Over the past several years, people have increasingly acquired  virtual possessions . We consider these things to include artifacts that are increasingly becoming immaterial (e.g. books, photos, music, movies) and things that have never traditionally had a lasting material form (e.g. SMS archives, social networking profiles, personal behavior logs). To date, little research exists about how people value and form attachments to virtual possessions. To investigate, we conducted a study with 21 teenagers exploring the perceived value of their virtual possessions, and the comparative similarities and differences with their material things. Findings are interpreted to detail design and research opportunities and issues in this emerging space.", "citation": "Citations (147)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["William Odom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Odom:William", "John Zimmerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmerman:John", "Jodi Forlizzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forlizzi:Jodi"], "pages": 10}
