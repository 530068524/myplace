However, implementing modern wireless protocols on existing SDR platforms often requires careful hand-tuning of low-level code, which can undermine the advantages of software. Ziria is a new domain-specific language (DSL) that offers programming abstractions suitable for wireless physical (PHY) layer tasks while emphasizing the pipeline reconfiguration aspects of PHY programming. The Ziria compiler implements a rich set of specialized optimizations, such as lookup table generation and pipeline fusion. We also offer a novel -- due to pipeline reconfiguration -- algorithm to optimize the data widths of computations in Ziria pipelines. We demonstrate the programming flexibility of Ziria and the performance of the generated code through a detailed evaluation of a line-rate Ziria WiFi 802.11a/g implementation that is on par and in many cases outperforms a hand-tuned state-of-the-art C++ implementation on commodity CPUs.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Princeton University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Drexel University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Gordon Stewart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stewart_0001:Gordon", "Mahanth Gowda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gowda:Mahanth", "Geoffrey Mainland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mainland:Geoffrey", "Bozidar Radunovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Radunovic:Bozidar", "Dimitrios Vytiniotis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vytiniotis:Dimitrios", "Cristina Luengo Agullo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agullo:Cristina_Luengo"], "pages": 14}
