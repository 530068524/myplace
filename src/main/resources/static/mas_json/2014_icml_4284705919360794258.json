We emphasize on cases with specific structure, which include many practical situations ranging from mean-based change-point detection to image segmentation problems. We aim at learning a Mahalanobis metric for these unsupervised problems, leading to feature weighting and/or selection. This is done in a supervised way by assuming the availability of several (partially) labeled datasets that share the same metric. We cast the metric learning problem as a large-margin structured prediction problem, with proper definition of regularizers and losses, leading to a convex optimization problem which can be solved efficiently. Our experiments show how learning the metric can significantly improve performance on bioinformatics, video or image segmentation problems.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["R\u00e9mi Lajugie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lajugie:R=eacute=mi", "Francis R.
