{"title": "Model-Independent Online Learning for Influence Maximization.", "fields": ["exploit", "submodular set function", "maximization", "regret", "monotone polygon"], "abstract": "We consider influence maximization (IM) in social networks, which is the problem of maximizing the number of users that become aware of a product by selecting a set of \"seed\" users to expose the product to. While prior work assumes a known model of information diffusion, we propose a novel parametrization that not only makes our framework agnostic to the underlying diffusion model, but also statistically efficient to learn from data. We give a corresponding monotone, submodular surrogate function, and show that it is a good approximation to the original IM objective. We also consider the case of a new marketer looking to exploit an existing social network, while simultaneously learning the factors governing information propagation. For this, we propose a pairwise-influence semi-bandit feedback model and develop a LinUCB-based bandit algorithm. Our model-independent analysis shows that our regret bound has a better (as compared to previous work) dependence on the size of the network. Experimental evaluation suggests that our framework is robust to the underlying diffusion model and can efficiently learn a near-optimal solution.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "University of British Columbia"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Sharan Vaswani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaswani:Sharan", "Branislav Kveton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kveton:Branislav", "Zheng Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Zheng", "Mohammad Ghavamzadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghavamzadeh:Mohammad", "Laks V.
