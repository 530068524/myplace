{"title": "Efficient Semantic Features for Automated Reasoning over Large Theories.", "fields": ["mathematical knowledge management", "automated reasoning", "semantic memory", "mathematical proof", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Large formal mathematical knowledge bases encode considerable parts of advanced mathematics and exact science, allowing deep semantic computer assistance and verification of complicated theories down to the atomic logical rules. An essential part of automated reasoning over such large theories are methods learning selection of relevant knowledge from the thousands of proofs in the corpora. Such methods in turn rely on efficiently computable features characterizing the highly structured and inter-related mathematical statements. In this work we (i) propose novel semantic features characterizing the statements in such large semantic knowledge bases, (ii) propose and carry out their efficient implementation using deductive-AI data-structures such as substitution trees and discrimination nets, and (iii) show that they significantly improve the strength of existing knowledge selection methods and automated reasoning methods over the large formal knowledge bases. In particular, on a standard large-theory benchmark we improve the average predicted rank of a mathematical statement needed for a proof by 22% in comparison with state of the art. This allows us to prove 8% more theorems in comparison with state of the art.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Innsbruck", "Radboud University Nijmegen", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "authors": ["Cezary Kaliszyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaliszyk:Cezary", "Josef Urban.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urban:Josef", "Jir\u00ed Vyskocil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vyskocil:Jir=iacute="], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
