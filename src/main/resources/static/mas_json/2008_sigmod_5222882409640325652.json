{"title": "Stream firewalling of xml constraints.", "fields": ["xml framework", "xml encryption", "simple api for xml", "xml schema"], "abstract": "As XML-based messages have become common in many client-server protocols, there is a need to protect application servers from invalid or dangerous messages. This leads to the XML stream firewalling problem; that of applying integrity constraints against a large number of simultaneous streams. We conduct the first investigation of a constraint engine optimized for the generation of XML stream firewalls. We isolate a class of DTDs and XPath constraints which support the generation of low-space filters, and provide algorithms for generating firewalls with low per-input-character time and per-stream space. We give experimental results which show that we have achieved these goals in practice.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Bell Labs", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Michael Benedikt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benedikt:Michael", "Alan Jeffrey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeffrey:Alan", "Ruy Ley-Wild.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ley=Wild:Ruy"], "pages": 12}
