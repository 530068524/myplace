At the core of our proposed method is a variance reduction technique inspired by the recent advance in stochastic optimization. We show that, to achieve $\\epsilon$ accuracy in 2-Wasserstein distance, our algorithm achieves $\\tilde O\\big(n+\\kappa^{2}d^{1/2}/\\epsilon+\\kappa^{4/3}d^{1/3}n^{2/3}/\\epsilon^{2/3}\\big)$ gradient complexity (i.e., number of component gradient evaluations), which outperforms the state-of-the-art HMC and stochastic gradient HMC methods in a wide regime. We also extend our algorithm for sampling from smooth and general log-concave distributions, and prove the corresponding gradient complexity as well. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["Difan Zou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zou:Difan", "Pan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Pan", "Quanquan Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Quanquan"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
