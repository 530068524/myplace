{"title": "Neural Network-based Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs on Word and Character Level.", "fields": ["nested word", "word problem", "exploit", "question answering", "encoder"], "abstract": "Question Answering (QA) systems over Knowledge Graphs (KG) automatically answer natural language questions using facts contained in a knowledge graph. Simple questions, which can be answered by the extraction of a single fact, constitute a large part of questions asked on the web but still pose challenges to QA systems, especially when asked against a large knowledge resource. Existing QA systems usually rely on various components each specialised in solving different sub-tasks of the problem (such as segmentation, entity recognition, disambiguation, and relation classification etc.). In this work, we follow a quite different approach: We train a neural network for answering simple questions in an end-to-end manner, leaving all decisions to the model. It learns to rank subject-predicate pairs to enable the retrieval of relevant facts given a question. The network contains a nested word/character-level question encoder which allows to handle out-of-vocabulary and rare word problems while still being able to exploit word-level semantics. Our approach achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end approaches that rely on an attention mechanism.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Bonn", "University of Bonn", "University of Bonn", "University of Bonn"], "authors": ["Denis Lukovnikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lukovnikov:Denis", "Asja Fischer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fischer:Asja", "Jens Lehmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehmann:Jens", "S\u00f6ren Auer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Auer:S=ouml=ren"], "conf": "www", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
