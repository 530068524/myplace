{"title": "Proximity: a measure to quantify the need for developers' coordination.", "fields": ["software development", "facilitation", "collaborative software", "sociotechnical system", "requirements management"], "abstract": "We describe a method for determining coordination requirements in collaborative software development. Our method uses \"live\" data based on developer activity rather than relying on historical data such as source code commits which is prevalent in existing methods. We introduce proximity, a measure of the strength of the work dependencies that lead to coordination requirements among members of a software development organization. Our proximity measure relies on a tool which captures the interactions of a developer with her IDE. It quantifies the similarity between records of interactions of developers as they work on their assigned tasks. We describe an algorithm that measures proximity between pairs of tasks or pairs of developers. Through an empirical study on an open source project that routinely records environment interaction data, we show how proximity accurately determines coordination requirements. The proximity measure thus enables proactive detection of coordination requirements and makes possible real time intervention and coordination facilitation via management-, design- and team-related decisions.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Drexel University", "Drexel University", "Drexel University"], "authors": ["Sean P.
