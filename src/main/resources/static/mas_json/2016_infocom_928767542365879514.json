{"title": "SoftLight: Adaptive visible light communication over screen-camera links.", "fields": ["visible light communication", "android", "barcode", "binary erasure channel", "goodput"], "abstract": "Screen-camera links for Visible Light Communication (VLC) are diverse, as the link quality varies according to many factors, such as ambient light and camera's performance. This paper presents SoftLight, a channel coding approach that considers the unique channel characteristics of VLC links and automatically adapts the transmission data rate to the link qualities of various scenarios. SoftLight incorporates two new ideas: (1) an expanded color modulation interface that provides soft hint about its confidence in each demodulated bit and establishes a bit-level VLC erasure channel, and (2) a rateless coding scheme that achieves bit-level rateless transmissions with low computation complexity and tolerates the false positive of bits provided by the soft hint enabled erasure channel. SoftLight is orthogonal to the visual coding schemes and can be applied atop any barcode layouts. We implement SoftLight on Android smartphones and evaluate its performance under a variety of environments. The experiment results show that SoftLight can correctly transmit a 22-KByte photo between two smartphones within 0.6 second and improves the average goodput of the state-of-the-art screen-camera VLC solution by 2.2.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Wan Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Wan", "Jansen Christian Liando.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liando:Jansen_Christian", "Mo Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Mo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
