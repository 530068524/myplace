{"title": "PHOG: Probabilistic Model for Code.", "fields": ["higher order grammar", "javascript", "probabilistic logic", "generative model", "context free grammar"], "abstract": "We introduce a new generative model for code called probabilistic higher order grammar (PHOG). PHOG generalizes probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) by allowing conditioning of a production rule beyond the parent non-terminal, thus capturing rich contexts relevant to programs. Even though PHOG is more powerful than a PCFG, it can be learned from data just as efficiently. We trained a PHOG model on a large JavaScript code corpus and show that it is more precise than existing models, while similarly fast. As a result, PHOG can immediately benefit existing programming tools based on probabilistic models of code.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Pavol Bielik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bielik:Pavol", "Veselin Raychev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raychev:Veselin", "Martin T.
