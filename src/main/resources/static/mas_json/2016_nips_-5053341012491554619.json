In spite of this, optimization algorithms are still designed by hand. In this paper we show how the design of an optimization algorithm can be cast as a learning problem, allowing the algorithm to learn to exploit structure in the problems of interest in an automatic way. Our learned algorithms, implemented by LSTMs, outperform generic, hand-designed competitors on the tasks for which they are trained, and also generalize well to new tasks with similar structure. We demonstrate this on a number of tasks, including simple convex problems, training neural networks, and styling images with neural art.", "citation": "Citations (254)", "departments": ["OpenAI", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Marcin Andrychowicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andrychowicz:Marcin", "Misha Denil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denil:Misha", "Sergio Gomez Colmenarejo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colmenarejo:Sergio_Gomez", "Matthew W.
