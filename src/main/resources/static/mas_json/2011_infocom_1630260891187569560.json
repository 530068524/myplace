Cooperative diversity mitigates fading in these networks by establishing virtual antenna arrays through clustering the nodes. A cluster in a cooperative diversity network is a collection of nodes that cooperatively transmits a single packet. There are two types of clustering schemes: static and dynamic. In static clustering all nodes start and stop transmission simultaneously, and nodes do not join or leave the cluster while the packet is being transmitted. Dynamic clustering allows a node to join an ongoing cooperative transmission of a packet as soon as the packet is received. In this paper we take a broad view of the cooperative network by examining packet flows, while still faithfully implementing the physical layer at the bit level. We evaluate both clustering schemes using simulations on large multi-flow networks. We demonstrate that dynamically-clustered cooperative networks substantially outperform both statically-clustered cooperative networks and classical point-to-point networks.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Boulat A.
