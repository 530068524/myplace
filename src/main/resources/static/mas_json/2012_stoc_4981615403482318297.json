Applications of our technique include an optimal computational hardness of (1/2 + e)-approximation for maximizing a symmetric nonnegative submodular function, an optimal hardness of (1-(1-1/k) k  + e)-approximation for welfare maximization in combinatorial auctions with k submodular bidders (for constant k), super-constant hardness for maximizing a nonnegative submodular function over matroid bases, and tighter bounds for maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint. Unlike the vast majority of computational inapproximability results, our approach does not use the PCP machinery or the Unique Games Conjecture, but relies instead on a direct reduction from Unique-SAT using list-decodable codes.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Cornell University", "IBM"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shahar Dobzinski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobzinski:Shahar", "Jan Vondr\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vondr=aacute=k:Jan"], "pages": 10}
