To enable effective and efficient shared memory dependence tracing, we present an optimistic scheme addressing the challenge of capturing exact dependences between unsynchronized events to reduce the probe effect of program instrumentation. Specifically, our approach achieved a wait-free fast path for thread-local reads on x86-TSO relaxed memory systems, and simultaneously achieved precise tracing of exact read-after-write, write-after-write and write-after-read dependences on the fly. We implemented an open-source RWTrace tool, and evaluation results show that our approach not only achieves efficient shared memory dependence tracing, but also scales well on a multi-core computer system.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Yanyan Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang_0001:Yanyan", "Du Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Du", "Chang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0001:Chang", "Xiaoxing Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiaoxing", "Jian Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0001:Jian"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
