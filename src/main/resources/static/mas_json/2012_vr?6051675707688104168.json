Look refers to perceived ambience of an image created by illumination and color tone. Regarding the Look-Change, we have been working on a relighting technique which allows MR space to have additional virtual illumination. Furthermore, we demonstrate a photorealistic approach to create photorealistic virtual objects with free-form polarized reflectometry which requires no specialized hardware and is portable, thus making it easy apply to MR.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University", "Ritsumeikan University"], "authors": ["Kaori Kikuchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kikuchi:Kaori", "Taiki Wada.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wada:Taiki", "Ryosuke Ichikari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ichikari:Ryosuke", "Asako Kimura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimura:Asako", "Fumihisa Shibata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shibata:Fumihisa", "Hideyuki Tamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamura:Hideyuki"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
