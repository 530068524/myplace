Our simulator achieves security $$Oq^8/2^n$$, similarly to the security of Dai et al. For further comparison, Dachman-Soled et al. achieve security $$Oq^{12}/2^n$$, while the original 14-round simulator of Holenstein et al. achieves security $$Oq^{10}/2^n$$.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Yuanxi Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Yuanxi", "John P.
