We propose a kinematic-vibrotactile mapping that targets fundamental movements (basic building blocks of human motion) using saltatory vibration patterns where vibrations are delivered and interpreted as movement through a conceptual mapping. Two conceptual mappings are explored: the \"follow me\" concept and the push/pull metaphor. A user study, approved by a local ethics committee, was conducted to explore how these conceptual mappings affect learnability, recognition accuracy, response time and naturalness. Results show the approach to work effectively with a combination of vibration patterns under each conceptual mapping providing the most useful design.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Troy L.
