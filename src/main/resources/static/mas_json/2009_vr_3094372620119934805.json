{"title": "Virtual Experiences for Social Perspective-Taking.", "fields": ["perspective taking", "immersion", "virtual reality", "computer graphics", "mixed reality"], "abstract": "This paper proposes virtual social perspective-taking (VSP). In VSP, users are immersed in an experience of another person to aid in understanding the person's perspective. Users are immersed by 1) providing input to user senses from logs of the target person's senses, 2) instructing users to act and interact like the target, and 3) reminding users that they are playing the role of the target. These guidelines are applied to a scenario where taking the perspective of others is crucial - the medical interview. A pilot study (n = 16) using this scenario indicates VSP elicits reflection on the perspectives of others and changes behavior in future, similar social interactions. By encouraging reflection and change, VSP advances the state-of-the-art in training social interactions with virtual experiences.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "Georgia Regents University", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Andrew Raij.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raij:Andrew", "Aaron Kotranza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotranza:Aaron", "D.
