This model is based on Markov theory and can compute both the time required to select a target and the number of visual flashes needed. We illustrate how to use this model with three different interaction techniques to select a target. A first experimental evaluation with three healthy participants shows a good match between the model and the experimental data.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Sup\u00e9lec", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "university of lille"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jean-Baptiste Sauvan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sauvan:Jean=Baptiste", "Anatole L\u00e9cuyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=eacute=cuyer:Anatole", "Fabien Lotte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lotte:Fabien", "G\u00e9ry Casiez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casiez:G=eacute=ry"], "pages": 4}
