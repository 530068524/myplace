Prior work however either require surgical procedures or in-mouth sensor placements. In this paper, we introduce TongueSee, a non-intrusive tongue machine interface that can recognize a rich set of tongue gestures using electromyography (EMG) signals from the surface of the skin. We demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of TongueSee with experimental studies to classify six tongue gestures across eight participants. TongueSee achieves a classification accuracy of 94.17% and a false positive probability of 0.000358 per second using three-protrusion preamble design.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Qiao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Qiao", "Shyamnath Gollakota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollakota:Shyamnath", "Ben Taskar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taskar:Ben", "Raj P.
