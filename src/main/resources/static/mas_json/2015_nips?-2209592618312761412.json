In the stochastic setting under semi-bandit feedback, we derive a problem-specific regret lower bound, and discuss its scaling with the dimension of the decision space. We propose ESCB, an algorithm that efficiently exploits the structure of the problem and provide a finite-time analysis of its regret. ESCB has better performance guarantees than existing algorithms, and significantly outperforms these algorithms in practice. In the adversarial setting under bandit feedback, we propose COMBEXP, an algorithm with the same regret scaling as state-of-the-art algorithms, but with lower computational complexity for some combinatorial problems.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Sup\u00e9lec", "Royal Institute of Technology", "Royal Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Richard Combes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Combes:Richard", "Mohammad Sadegh Talebi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talebi:Mohammad_Sadegh", "Alexandre Prouti\u00e8re.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prouti=egrave=re:Alexandre", "Marc Lelarge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lelarge:Marc"], "pages": 9}
