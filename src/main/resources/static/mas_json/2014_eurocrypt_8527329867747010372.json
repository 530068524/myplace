Recently, Bellare, Waters and Yilek considered SOA-security in the identity-based setting, and presented the first identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes that are proven secure against selective opening chosen plaintext attack (SO-CPA). However, how to achieve SO-CCA security for IBE is still open.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Jinan University", "Singapore Management University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Jinan University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Junzuo Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Junzuo", "Robert H.
