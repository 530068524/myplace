It is quite challenging due to the model diversities to illustrate varied text effects for different characters. To address this issue, our key idea is to exploit the analytics on the high regularity of the spatial distribution for text effects to guide the synthesis process. Specifically, we characterize the stylized patches by their normalized positions and the optimal scales to depict their style elements. Our method first estimates these two features and derives their correlation statistically. They are then converted into soft constraints for texture transfer to accomplish adaptive multi-scale texture synthesis and to make style element distribution uniform. It allows our algorithm to produce artistic typography that fits for both local texture patterns and the global spatial distribution in the example. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method for various text effects over conventional style transfer methods. In addition, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm with extensive artistic typography library generation.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shuai Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shuai", "Jiaying Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Jiaying", "Zhouhui Lian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lian:Zhouhui", "Zongming Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Zongming"], "pages": 10}
