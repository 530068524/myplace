{"title": "CloneDetective - A workbench for clone detection research.", "fields": ["clone", "heuristics", "workbench", "software maintenance", "software evolution"], "abstract": "The area of clone detection has considerably evolved over the last decade, leading to approaches with better results, but at the same time using more elaborate algorithms and tool chains. In our opinion a level has been reached, where the initial investment required to setup a clone detection tool chain and the code infrastructure required for experimenting with new heuristics and algorithms seriously hampers the exploration of novel solutions or specific case studies. As a solution, this paper presents CloneDetective, an open source framework and tool chain for clone detection, which is especially geared towards configurability and extendability and thus supports the preparation and conduction of clone detection research.", "citation": "Citations (124)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Elmar J\u00fcrgens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=uuml=rgens:Elmar", "Florian Deissenboeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deissenboeck:Florian", "Benjamin Hummel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hummel:Benjamin"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
