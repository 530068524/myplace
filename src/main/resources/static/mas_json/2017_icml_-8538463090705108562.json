Existing methods often lack a principled probabilistic formulation. In this paper, we propose a clustering method based on a tree-structured graphical model to describe the generation process of mixed-type data. Our tree-structured model factorizes into a product of pairwise interactions, and thus localizes the interaction between feature variables of different types. To provide a robust clustering method based on the tree-model, we adopt a topographical view and compute peaks of the density function and their attractive basins for clustering. Furthermore, we leverage the theory from topology data analysis to adaptively merge trivial peaks into large ones in order to achieve meaningful clusterings. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on mixed-type data.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics", "University of Sussex", "Ohio State University", "Queens College"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Xiuyan Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Xiuyan", "Novi Quadrianto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quadrianto:Novi", "Yusu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yusu", "Chao Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Chao"], "pages": 10}
