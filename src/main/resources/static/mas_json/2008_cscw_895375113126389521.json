However, because of the coordination needed to write an article collaboratively, adding contributors is costly. We examined how the number of editors in Wikipedia and the coordination methods they use affect article quality. We distinguish between explicit coordination, in which editors plan the article through communication, and implicit coordination, in which a subset of editors structure the work by doing the majority of it. Adding more editors to an article improved article quality only when they used appropriate coordination techniques and was harmful when they did not. Implicit coordination through concentrating the work was more helpful when many editors contributed, but explicit coordination through communication was not. Both types of coordination improved quality more when an article was in a formative stage. These results demonstrate the critical importance of coordination in effectively harnessing the \"wisdom of the crowd\" in online production environments.", "citation": "Citations (672)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Aniket Kittur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kittur:Aniket", "Robert E.
