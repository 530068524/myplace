When the size of the matrix in question is large, the computational complexity of finding a solution is costly. To reduce this expensive computational complexity, we apply Kronecker products to handle the matrix completion problem. In particular, we propose using Kronecker factorization, which approximates a matrix by the Kronecker product of several matrices of smaller sizes. We introduce Kronecker factorization into the soft-impute framework and devise an effective matrix completion algorithm. Especially when the factorized matrices have about the same sizes, the computational complexity of our algorithm is improved substantially.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "authors": ["Hui Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Hui", "Jiuqiang Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jiuqiang", "Naiyan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Naiyan", "Congfu Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Congfu", "Zhihua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhihua"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
