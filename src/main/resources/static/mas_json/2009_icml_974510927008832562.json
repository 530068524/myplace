{"title": "Surrogate regret bounds for proper losses.", "fields": ["canonical link element", "bregman divergence", "regret", "taylor s theorem", "convexity"], "abstract": "We present tight surrogate regret bounds for the class of proper ( i.e. , Fisher consistent) losses. The bounds generalise the margin-based bounds due to Bartlett et al. (2006). The proof uses Taylor's theorem and leads to new representations for loss and regret and a simple proof of the integral representation of proper losses. We also present a different formulation of a duality result of Bregman divergences which leads to a simple demonstration of the convexity of composite losses using canonical link functions.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "authors": ["Mark D.
