{"title": "Revealing parallel scans and reductions in sequential loops through function reconstruction.", "fields": ["computer science", "parallel computing", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Many sequential loops are actually scans or reductions and can be parallelized across iterations despite the loop-carried dependences. In this work, we consider the parallelization of such scan/reduction loops, and propose a practical runtime approach called  sampling-and-reconstruction  to extract the hidden scan/reduction patterns in these loops.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Peng Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Peng", "Gagan Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Gagan"], "pages": 2}
