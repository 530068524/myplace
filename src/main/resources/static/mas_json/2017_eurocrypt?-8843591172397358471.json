Solving this problem recovers the private key in cryptosystems introduced by Gentry, Smart\u2013Vercauteren, Gentry\u2013Halevi, Garg\u2013Gentry\u2013Halevi, et al. Work over the last few years has shown that for some number fields this problem has a surprisingly low post-quantum security level. This paper shows, and experimentally verifies, that for some number fields this problem has a surprisingly low pre-quantum security level.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Jens Bauch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauch:Jens", "Daniel J.
