Paralocks combine the expressive power of Flow Locks (Broberg & Sands, ESOP'06) with the ability to express policies involving run-time principles, roles (in the style of role-based access control), and relations (such as \"acts-for\" in discretionary access control). We illustrate the Paralocks policy language by giving a simple encoding of Myers and Liskov's Decentralized Label Model (DLM). Furthermore - and unlike the DLM - we provide an information flow semantics for full Paralock policies. Lastly we illustrate how Paralocks can be statically verified by providing a simple programming language incorporating Paralock policy specifications, and a static type system which soundly enforces information flow security according to the Paralock semantics.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["Chalmers University of Technology", "Chalmers University of Technology"], "authors": ["Niklas Broberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Broberg:Niklas", "David Sands.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sands:David"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2010", "pages": 14}
