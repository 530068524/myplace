Although, prior research has addressed the problem of training classifiers with limited data and computation, few efforts have tackled the problem of memory constraints on recognition. We explore methods that can guide the allocation of limited storage resources for classifying streaming data so as to maximize discriminatory power. We focus on computation of the expected value of information with nearest neighbor classifiers for online face recognition. Experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness and power of the approach. The methods provide a principled approach to vision under bounded resources, and have immediate application to enhancing recognition capabilities in consumer devices with limited memory.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ashish Kapoor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kapoor:Ashish", "Simon Baker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baker:Simon", "Sumit Basu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basu:Sumit", "Eric Horvitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Horvitz:Eric"], "pages": 8}
