{"title": "Is This Thing On?: Crowdsourcing Privacy Indicators for Ubiquitous Sensing Platforms.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "gesture", "interactive kiosk", "principle of least privilege", "wearable technology"], "abstract": "We are approaching an environment where ubiquitous computing devices will constantly accept input via audio and video channels: kiosks that determine demographic information of passersby, gesture controlled home entertainment systems and audio controlled wearable devices are just a few examples. To enforce the principle of least privilege, recent proposals have suggested technical approaches to limit third-party applications to receiving only the data they need, rather than entire audio or video streams. For users to make informed privacy decisions, applications will still need to communicate what data they are accessing and indicators will be needed to communicate this information. We performed several crowdsourcing experiments to examine how potential users might conceptualize and understand privacy indicators on ubiquitous sensing platforms.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["International Computer Science Institute", "Intel", "Intel"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Serge Egelman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Egelman:Serge", "Raghudeep Kannavara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kannavara:Raghudeep", "Richard Chow.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chow:Richard"], "pages": 10}
