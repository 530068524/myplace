Our methods are based on a novel combination of compressed sensing and graph coloring techniques, and provably exploit structural prior knowledge about the Jacobian such as sparsity and symmetry while being noise robust. We demonstrate efficient backpropagation through noisy blackbox layers in a deep neural net, improved data-efficiency in the task of linearizing the dynamics of a rigid body system, and the generic ability to handle a rich class of input-output dependency structures in Jacobian estimation problems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Google", "Google"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Krzysztof Marcin Choromanski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choromanski:Krzysztof_Marcin", "Vikas Sindhwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sindhwani:Vikas"], "pages": 9}
