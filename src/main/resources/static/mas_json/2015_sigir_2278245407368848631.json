Comparing rankings in ways that can yield useful insights is thus an important capability. When making such comparisons, it is often useful to give greater weight to comparisons near the head of a ranked list than to what happens further down. This is the focus of the widely used \u03c4 AP  measure. When scores are available, gap-sensitive measures give greater weight to larger differences than to smaller ones. This is the focus of the widely used Pearson correlation measure (\u03c1). This paper introduces a new measure, \u03c4 GAP , which combines both features. System comparisons from the TREC 5 Ad Hoc track are used to illustrate the differences in emphasis achieved by \u03c4 AP , \u03c1, and the proposed \u03c4 GAP .", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Ning Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Ning", "Douglas W.
