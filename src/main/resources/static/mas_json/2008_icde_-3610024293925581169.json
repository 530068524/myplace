DescribeX implements a framework for creating XML summaries described using axis path regular expressions (abbreviated AxPRE). AxPRE's capture all the bisimilarity-based proposals in the summary literature and they can be used to define new and more expressive summaries. This demonstration shows how DescribeX helps to analyze diverse XML collections in one particular scenario: the analysis of protein-protein interaction XML data from multiple providers that conform to the PSI-MI schema.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Mir Sadek Ali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ali:Mir_Sadek", "Mariano P.
