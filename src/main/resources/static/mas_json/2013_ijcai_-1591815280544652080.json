However, its intrinsic complexity has been a limitation to the implementation of abductive reasoning tools in more expressive logics. We have devised such a tool in ground flat equational logic, in which literals are equations or disequations between constants. Our tool is based on the computation of prime implicates. It uses a relaxed paramodulation calculus, designed to generate all prime implicates of a formula, together with a carefully defined data structure storing the implicates and able to efficiently detect, and remove, redundancies. In addition to a detailed description of this method, we present an analysis of some experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Grenoble", "University of Grenoble", "University of Grenoble"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Mnacho Echenim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Echenim:Mnacho", "Nicolas Peltier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peltier:Nicolas", "Sophie Tourret.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tourret:Sophie"], "pages": 7}
