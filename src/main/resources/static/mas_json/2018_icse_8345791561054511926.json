{"title": "CCAligner: a token based large-gap clone detector.", "fields": ["software development", "edit distance", "precision and recall", "copying", "best execution"], "abstract": "Copying code and then pasting with large number of edits is a common activity in software development, and the pasted code is a kind of complicated Type-3 clone. Due to large number of edits, we consider the clone as a large-gap clone. Large-gap clone can reflect the extension of code, such as change and improvement. The existing state-of-the-art clone detectors suffer from several limitations in detecting large-gap clones. In this paper, we propose a tool, CCAligner, using code window that considers  e  edit distance for matching to detect large-gap clones. In our approach, a novel  e -mismatch index is designed and the asymmetric similarity coefficient is used for similarity measure. We thoroughly evaluate CCAligner both for large-gap clone detection, and for general Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 clone detection. The results show that CCAligner performs better than other competing tools in large-gap clone detection, and has the best execution time for 10MLOC input with good precision and recall in general Type-1 to Type-3 clone detection. Compared with existing state-of-the-art tools, CCAligner is the best performing large-gap clone detection tool, and remains competitive with the best clone detectors in general Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 clone detection.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Science and Technology of China", "University of Saskatchewan"], "authors": ["Pengcheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Pengcheng", "Jeffrey Svajlenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svajlenko:Jeffrey", "Yanzhao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yanzhao", "Yun Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Yun", "Chanchal K.
