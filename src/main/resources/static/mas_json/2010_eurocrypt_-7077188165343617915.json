As far as we know, this is the first construction of a constant-round non-malleable protocol based on only one-wayness, or to admit a black-box proof of security under any standard-type assumption.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Queens College"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael", "Hoeteck Wee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wee:Hoeteck"], "pages": 18}
