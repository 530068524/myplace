They are appealing from a learning perspective because they are fully observed (meaning expressions for maximum likelihood do not involve hidden quantities), but are still expressive enough to both capture existing models and predict new models. While maximum-likelihood learning algorithms for EFPSRs exist, they are not computationally feasible. We present a new, computationally efficient, learning algorithm based on an approximate likelihood function. The algorithm can be interpreted as attempting to induce stationary distributions of observations, features and states which match their empirically observed counterparts. The approximate likelihood, and the idea of matching stationary distributions, may apply to other models.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["David Wingate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wingate:David", "Satinder P.
