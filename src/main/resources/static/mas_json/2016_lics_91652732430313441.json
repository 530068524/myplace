The construction provides a compositional denotational semantics for lossless iteration in probabilistic programming languages, even in the absence of a natural partial order.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Cornell University"], "authors": ["Dexter Kozen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozen:Dexter"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 8}
