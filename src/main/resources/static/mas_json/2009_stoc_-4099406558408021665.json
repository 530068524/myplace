This basic construct underlies \"hardness amplification\" in cryptography, circuit complexity and PCPs. Goldreich and Safra [12] pioneered its local  testing  and its PCP application. A recent result by Dinur and Goldenberg [5] enabled for the first time testing proximity to this important code in the \"list-decoding\" regime. In particular, they give a 2-query test which works for  polynomially small  success probability 1/k \u03b1 , and show that no such test works below success probability 1/k. Our main result is a 3-query test which works for  exponentially small  success probability exp(-k \u03b1 ). Our techniques (based on recent simplified decoding algorithms for the same code [15]) also allow us to considerably simplify the analysis of the 2-query test of [5]. We then show how to  derandomize  their test, achieving a code of polynomial rate, independent of k, and success probability 1/k \u03b1 . Finally we show the applicability of the new tests to PCPs. Starting with a 2-query PCP over an alphabet \u03a3 and with soundness error 1-\u03b4, Rao [19] (building on Raz's (k-fold) parallel repetition theorem [20] and Holenstein's proof [13]) obtains a new 2-query PCP over the alphabet \u03a3 k  with soundness error exp(-\u03b4 2  k). Our techniques yield a 2-query PCP with soundness error exp(-\u03b4 \u221ak). Our PCP construction turns out to be essentially the same as the miss-match proof system defined and analyzed by Feige and Kilian [8], but with simpler analysis and exponentially better soundness error.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Institute for Advanced Study", "Simon Fraser University", "Institute for Advanced Study"], "authors": ["Russell Impagliazzo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Impagliazzo:Russell", "Valentine Kabanets.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kabanets:Valentine", "Avi Wigderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wigderson:Avi"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
