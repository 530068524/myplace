By only recovering features calculated from images, large amount of computation for 3D reconstructing and features tracking in 3D voxel grid is avoided. Thus, our system becomes an ideal tool for bimanual 3D gesture interaction, which needs neither markers nor gloves. Experimental results show that our method can complete the same pipeline with much less computational resource compared to existing ones. What's more, the application interface shows the effectiveness and intuitiveness of our bimanual tracking method.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Hangzhou Normal University"], "authors": ["Junhao Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Junhao", "Mingmin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Mingmin", "Zhigeng Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Zhigeng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
