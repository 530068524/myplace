Our research is motivated by the fact that much of the content on public displays includes text. Hence, researchers and practitioners could greatly benefit from users being able to spontaneously  interact  as well as to implicitly  calibrate  an eye tracker while simply reading this text. In particular, we adapt Pursuits, a technique that correlates users' eye movements with moving on-screen targets. While prior work used abstract objects or dots as targets, we explore the use of Pursuits with text (read-and-pursue). Thereby we address the challenge that eye movements performed while reading interfere with the pursuit movements. Results from two user studies (N=37) show that Pursuits with text is feasible and can achieve similar accuracy as non text-based pursuit approaches. While calibration is less accurate, it integrates smoothly with reading and allows areas of the display the user is looking at to be identified.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Max Planck Society", "Sonix Group, Munich, Germany"], "authors": ["Mohamed Khamis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khamis:Mohamed", "Ozan Saltuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saltuk:Ozan", "Alina Hang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hang:Alina", "Katharina Stolz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stolz:Katharina", "Andreas Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Andreas", "Florian Alt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alt:Florian"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
