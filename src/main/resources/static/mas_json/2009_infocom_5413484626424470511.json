Motivated by real-time applications that have stringent delay constraints, we develop a dynamic cooperation strategy that makes optimal use of network resources to achieve a target outage probability (reliability) for each user subj ect to average power constraints. Using the technique of Lyapunov optimization, we first present a general framework to solve t his problem and then derive quasi-closed form solutions for several cooperative protocols proposed in the literature. Unlike earlier works, our scheme does not require prior knowledge of the statistical description of the packet arrival, channel sta te and node mobility processes and can be implemented in an online fashion.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "IBM", "University of Southern California"], "conf": "infocom", "authors": ["Rahul Urgaonkar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urgaonkar:Rahul", "Michael J.
