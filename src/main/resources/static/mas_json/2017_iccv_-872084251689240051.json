{"title": "MoFA: Model-Based Deep Convolutional Face Autoencoder for Unsupervised Monocular Reconstruction.", "fields": ["generative model", "encoder", "autoencoder", "image formation", "color image"], "abstract": "In this work we propose a novel model-based deep convolutional autoencoder that addresses the highly challenging problem of reconstructing a 3D human face from a single in-the-wild color image. To this end, we combine a convolutional encoder network with an expert-designed generative model that serves as decoder. The core innovation is the differentiable parametric decoder that encapsulates image formation analytically based on a generative model. Our decoder takes as input a code vector with exactly defined semantic meaning that encodes detailed face pose, shape, expression, skin reflectance and scene illumination. Due to this new way of combining CNN-based with model-based face reconstruction, the CNN-based encoder learns to extract semantically meaningful parameters from a single monocular input image. For the first time, a CNN encoder and an expert-designed generative model can be trained end-to-end in an unsupervised manner, which renders training on very large (unlabeled) real world data feasible. The obtained reconstructions compare favorably to current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quality and richness of representation.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "External Organizations"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ayush Tewari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tewari:Ayush", "Michael Zollh\u00f6fer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zollh=ouml=fer:Michael", "Hyeongwoo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyeongwoo", "Pablo Garrido.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garrido_0001:Pablo", "Florian Bernard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bernard:Florian", "Patrick P\u00e9rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=eacute=rez:Patrick", "Christian Theobalt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobalt:Christian"], "pages": 10}
