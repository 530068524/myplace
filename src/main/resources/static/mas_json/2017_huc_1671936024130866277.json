Data previously recorded from a living lab apartment is reconstructed, revealing patterns of movement and occupancy. A sample use-case is presented wherein the individual's data is mapped onto a new home in order to reveal how existing behavioral patterns might be impeded or facilitated by differences in the built environment.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jason Nawyn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nawyn:Jason", "Carson Smuts.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smuts:Carson", "Kent Larson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larson:Kent"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
