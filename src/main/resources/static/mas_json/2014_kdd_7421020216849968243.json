However, such user-generated resources are often plagued by inaccuracies and misinformation. In this work we propose a method for automatically establishing the credibility of user-generated medical statements and the trustworthiness of their authors by exploiting linguistic cues and distant supervision from expert sources. To this end we introduce a probabilistic graphical model that jointly learns user trustworthiness, statement credibility, and language objectivity.   We apply this methodology to the task of extracting rare or unknown side-effects of medical drugs --- this being one of the problems where large scale non-expert data has the potential to complement expert medical knowledge. We show that our method can reliably extract side-effects and filter out false statements, while identifying trustworthy users that are likely to contribute valuable medical information.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Subhabrata Mukherjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukherjee:Subhabrata", "Gerhard Weikum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weikum:Gerhard", "Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danescu=Niculescu=Mizil:Cristian"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
