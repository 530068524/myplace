{"title": "Implementing an Inference Engine for RDFS/OWL Constructs and User-Defined Rules in Oracle.", "fields": ["semantic data model", "ontology inference layer", "semantic similarity", "database application", "inference engine"], "abstract": "This inference engines are an integral part of semantic data stores. In this paper, we describe our experience of implementing a scalable inference engine for Oracle semantic data store. This inference engine computes production rule based entailment of one or more RDFS/OWL encoded semantic data models. The inference engine capabilities include (i) inferencing based on semantics of RDFS/OWL constructs and user-defined rules, (ii) computing ancillary information (namely, semantic distance and proof) for inferred triples, and (iii) validation of semantic data model based on RDFS/OWL semantics. A unique aspect of our approach is that the inference engine is implemented entirely as a database application on top of Oracle database. The paper describes the inferencing requirements, challenges in supporting a sufficiently expressive set of RDFS/OWL constructs, and techniques adopted to build a scalable inference engine. A performance study conducted using both native and synthesized semantic datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (140)", "departments": ["Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation", "Oracle Corporation"], "authors": ["Zhe Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Zhe", "George Eadon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eadon:George", "Souripriya Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das:Souripriya", "Eugene Inseok Chong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chong:Eugene_Inseok", "Vladimir Kolovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kolovski:Vladimir", "Melliyal Annamalai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Annamalai:Melliyal", "Jagannathan Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Jagannathan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
