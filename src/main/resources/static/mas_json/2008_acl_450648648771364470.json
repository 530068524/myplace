{"title": "EM Can Find Pretty Good HMM POS-Taggers (When Given a Good Start).", "fields": ["uniform distribution", "machine learning", "hidden markov model", "artificial intelligence", "initial value problem"], "abstract": "We address the task of unsupervised POS tagging. We demonstrate that good results can be obtained using the robust EM-HMM learner when provided with good initial conditions, even with incomplete dictionaries. We present a family of algorithms to compute effective initial estimations p(t|w). We test the method on the task of full morphological disambiguation in Hebrew achieving an error reduction of 25% over a strong uniform distribution baseline. We also test the same method on the standard WSJ unsupervised POS tagging task and obtain results competitive with recent state-ofthe-art methods, while using simple and efficient learning methods.", "citation": "Citations (74)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of t ... omputer Science", "University of t ... omputer Science", "University of t ... omputer Science"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yoav Goldberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldberg:Yoav", "Meni Adler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adler:Meni", "Michael Elhadad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elhadad:Michael"], "pages": 9}
