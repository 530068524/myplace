We view this task as a statistical transductive inference, in which some pixels are already associated with given zones and the remaining ones need to be classified. Our method relies on the Laplacian graph regularizer, a powerful manifold learning tool that is based on the estimation of variants of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and is tightly related to diffusion processes. Segmentation is modeled as the task of finding matting coefficients for unclassified pixels given known matting coefficients for seed pixels. The proposed algorithm essentially relies on a high margin assumption in the space of pixel characteristics. It is simple, fast, and accurate, as demonstrated by qualitative results on natural images and a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art methods on the Microsoft GrabCut segmentation database.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Olivier Duchenne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duchenne:Olivier", "Jean-Yves Audibert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Audibert:Jean=Yves", "Renaud Keriven.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keriven:Renaud", "Jean Ponce.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponce:Jean", "Florent S\u00e9gonne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=eacute=gonne:Florent"], "pages": -1}
