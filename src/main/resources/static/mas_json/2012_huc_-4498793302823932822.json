The data set that is used in this work is a GPS trajectory of some users, which is gathered over 2 years. In order to have more accurate predictions and recommendations, we present a model that injects additional information to the main data set and we aim to apply a mathematical method on the merged data. On the merged data set, singular value decomposition technique is applied to extract latent relations. Several tests have been conducted, and the results of our proposed method are compared with a similar work for the same data set.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Middle East Technical University", "Middle East Technical University", "Middle East Technical University", "Middle East Technical University", "Aristotle Unive ... aloniki, Greece"], "authors": ["Masoud Sattari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sattari:Masoud", "Murat Manguoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manguoglu:Murat", "Ismail H.
