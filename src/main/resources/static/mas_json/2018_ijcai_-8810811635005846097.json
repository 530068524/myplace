{"title": "Socially Motivated Partial Cooperation in Multi-agent Local Search.", "fields": ["distributed constraint optimization", "local search", "machine learning", "empirical research", "computer science", "scheduling", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "Partial Cooperation is a paradigm and a corresponding model for representing multi-agent systems in which agents are willing to cooperate in order to achieve a global goal, as long as some minimal threshold on their personal utility is satisfied. Distributed local search algorithms were proposed in order to solve asymmetric distributed constraint optimization problems (ADCOPs) in which agents are partially cooperative. We contribute by: 1) extending the partial cooperative model to allow it to represent dynamic cooperation intentions, affected by changes in agents' wealth, in accordance with social studies literature. 2) proposing a novel local search algorithm in which agents receive indications of others' preferences on their actions and thus, can perform actions that are socially beneficial. Our empirical study reveals the advantage of the proposed algorithm in multiple benchmarks. Specifically, on realistic meeting scheduling problems it overcomes limitations of standard local search algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "authors": ["Tal Ze'evi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Ze=evi:Tal", "Roie Zivan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zivan:Roie", "Omer Lev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lev:Omer"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
