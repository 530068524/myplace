It operates in real-time and employs information from two cameras with non-overlapping fields of view. Monocular Visual Odometry supplying up-to-scale 6D motion information is carried out in each of the cameras, and the metric scale is recovered via a linear solution by imposing the known static transformation between both sensors. The redundancy in the motion estimates is finally exploited by a statistical fusion to an optimal 6D metric result. The proposed technique is robust to outliers and able to continuously deliver a reasonable measurement of the scale factor. The quality of the framework is demonstrated by a concise evaluation on indoor datasets, including a comparison to accurate ground truth data provided by an external motion tracking system.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tim Kazik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazik:Tim", "Laurent Kneip.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kneip:Laurent", "Janosch Nikolic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nikolic:Janosch", "Marc Pollefeys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pollefeys:Marc", "Roland Siegwart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siegwart:Roland"], "pages": 8}
