For two kinds of outliers, i.e., sample outliers and intra-sample outliers, we derive iterative algorithms on the basis of the Lagrange multipliers. We also demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the original MPCA when datasets contain such outliers experimentally.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Kyushu University", "Kyushu University", "Kyushu University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Kohei Inoue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inoue:Kohei", "Kenji Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hara:Kenji", "Kiichi Urahama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Urahama:Kiichi"], "pages": 7}
