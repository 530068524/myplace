{"title": "Towards Robust Abstractive Multi-Document Summarization: A Caseframe Analysis of Centrality and Domain.", "fields": ["sentence", "centrality", "multi document summarization", "automatic summarization", "source text"], "abstract": "In automatic summarization, centrality is the notion that a summary should contain the core parts of the source text. Current systems use centrality, along with redundancy avoidance and some sentence compression, to produce mostly extractive summaries. In this paper, we investigate how summarization can advance past this paradigm towards robust abstraction by making greater use of the domain of the source text. We conduct a series of studies comparing human-written model summaries to system summaries at the semantic level of caseframes. We show that model summaries (1) are more abstractive and make use of more sentence aggregation, (2) do not contain as many topical caseframes as system summaries, and (3) cannot be reconstructed solely from the source text, but can be if texts from in-domain documents are added. These results suggest that substantial improvements are unlikely to result from better optimizing centrality-based criteria, but rather more domain knowledge is needed.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jackie Chi Kit Cheung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheung:Jackie_Chi_Kit", "Gerald Penn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Penn:Gerald"], "pages": 10}
