Given an oversegmented image, our method determines the subset of spatially contiguous regions whose collective features will maximize a classifier's score. We formulate the objective as an instance of the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem, and show that for a family of additive classifiers this enables fast search for the optimal object region via a branch-and-cut algorithm. Unlike existing branch-and-bounddetection methods designed for bounding boxes, our approach allows scoring of irregular shapes \u2014 which is especially critical for objects that do not conform to a rectangular window. We provide results on three challenging object detection datasets, and demonstrate the advantage of rapidly seeking best-scoring regions rather than subwindow rectangles.", "citation": "Citations (79)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vijayanarasimhan:Sudheendra", "Kristen Grauman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grauman:Kristen"], "pages": 8}
