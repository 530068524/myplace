MMAP enables a modeler to construct domain-specific AOM languages at relatively low cost. In this paper, we show the overview of an AspectM support tool consisting of a reflective model editor and a verifying model weaver.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Kyushu Institute of Technology", "Kyushu Institute of Technology", "Kyushu Institute of Technology", "Kyushu Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Naoyasu Ubayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ubayashi:Naoyasu", "Genya Otsubo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Otsubo:Genya", "Kazuhide Noda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noda:Kazuhide", "Jun Yoshida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshida:Jun", "Tetsuo Tamai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tamai:Tetsuo"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 2}
