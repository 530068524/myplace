We study iterated Boolean games. These are games in which players repeatedly choose truth values for Boolean variables they have control over. Our model of iterated Boolean games assumes that players have goals given by formulae of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), a formalism for expressing properties of state sequences. In order to represent the strategies of players in such games, we use a finite state machine model. After introducing and formally defining iterated Boolean games, we investigate the computational complexity of their associated game-theoretic decision problems, as well as semantic conditions characterising classes of LTL properties that are preserved by equilibrium points (pure-strategy Nash equilibria) whenever they exist.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Julian Gutierrez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gutierrez_0001:Julian", "Paul Harrenstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrenstein:Paul", "Michael Wooldridge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wooldridge:Michael"], "pages": 7}
