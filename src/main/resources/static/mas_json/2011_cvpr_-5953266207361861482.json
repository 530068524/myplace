Our motivation to employ supervision is to tackle a task-specific segmentation problem where the semantic objects are pre-defined by the user. The video model we propose for this problem is based on a tree structured approximation of a patch based undirected mixture model, which includes a novel time-series and a soft label Random Forest classifier participating in a feedback mechanism. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model in cutting out foreground objects and multi-class segmentation problems in lengthy and complex road scene sequences. Our results have wide applicability, including harvesting labelled video data for training discriminative models, shape/pose/articulation learning and large scale statistical analysis to develop priors for video segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ignas Budvytis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Budvytis:Ignas", "Vijay Badrinarayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Badrinarayanan:Vijay", "Roberto Cipolla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cipolla:Roberto"], "pages": 8}
