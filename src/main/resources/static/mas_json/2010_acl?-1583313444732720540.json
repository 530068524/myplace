In this paper, we present a methodology to automatically extend WordNet with large amounts of semantic relations from an encyclopedic resource, namely Wikipedia. We show that, when provided with a vast amount of high-quality semantic relations, simple knowledge-lean disambiguation algorithms compete with state-of-the-art supervised WSD systems in a coarse-grained all-words setting and outperform them on gold-standard domain-specific datasets.", "citation": "Citations (211)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Simone Paolo Ponzetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Ponzetto:Simone_Paolo", "Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto"], "pages": 10}
