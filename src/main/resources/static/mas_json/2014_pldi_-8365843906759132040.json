{"title": "Adapton: composable, demand-driven incremental computation.", "fields": ["implementation", "graph", "computation", "reuse", "observer"], "abstract": "Many researchers have proposed programming languages that support  incremental computation  (IC), which allows programs to be efficiently re-executed after a small change to the input. However, existing implementations of such languages have two important drawbacks. First, recomputation is oblivious to specific demands on the program output; that is, if a program input changes, all dependencies will be recomputed, even if an observer no longer requires certain outputs. Second, programs are made incremental as a unit, with little or no support for reusing results outside of their original context, e.g., when reordered.   To address these problems, we present \u03bb ic  cdd , a core calculus that applies a  demand-driven  semantics to incremental computation, tracking changes in a hierarchical fashion in a novel  demanded computation graph . \u03bb ic  cdd  also formalizes an explicit separation between inner, incremental computations and outer observers. This combination ensures \u03bb ic  cdd  programs only recompute computations as demanded by observers, and allows inner computations to be reused more liberally. We present Adapton, an OCaml library implementing \u03bb ic  cdd . We evaluated Adapton on a range of benchmarks, and found that it provides reliable speedups, and in many cases dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art IC approaches.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Matthew A.
