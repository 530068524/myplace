{"title": "Parallelizing Sequential Graph Computations.", "fields": ["scalability", "partial evaluation", "programming paradigm", "monotonic function", "graph"], "abstract": "This paper presents  GRAPE , a parallel system for graph computations.  GRAPE  differs from prior systems in its ability to parallelize existing sequential graph algorithms as a whole. Underlying GRAPE are a simple programming model and a principled approach, based on partial evaluation and incremental computation. We show that sequential graph algorithms can be \"plugged into\"  GRAPE  with minor changes, and get parallelized. As long as the sequential algorithms are correct, their  GRAPE  parallelization guarantees to terminate with correct answers under a monotonic condition. Moreover, we show that algorithms in MapReduce, BSP and PRAM can be optimally simulated on  GRAPE . In addition to the ease of programming, we experimentally verify that  GRAPE  achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art graph systems, using real-life and synthetic graphs.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "Washington State University", "Beihang University", "Hong Kong Baptist University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Wenfei Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Wenfei", "Jingbo Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jingbo", "Yinghui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yinghui", "Wenyuan Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Wenyuan", "Jiaxin Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Jiaxin", "Zeyu Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Zeyu", "Bohan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Bohan", "Yang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Yang", "Chao Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Chao"], "pages": 16}
