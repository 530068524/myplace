Yet maintaining VLC performance under link dynamics remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we build a VLC software-radio testbed and examine VLC channel dynamics through comprehensive measurement. We find minor device movement or orientation change can cause the VLC link SNR to vary by tens of dB even within one packet duration, which renders existing WiFi rate adaptation protocols ineffective. We thus propose a new mechanism, DLit, that leverages two unique properties of VLC links (predictability and full-duplex) to realize fine-grained, in-frame rate adaptation. Our prototype implementation and experiments demonstrate that DLit achieves near-optimal performance for mobile VLC usage cases, and outperforms conventional packet-level adaptation schemes by multiple folds.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Jialiang Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jialiang", "Xinyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Xinyu", "Gang Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Gang"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
