Such models have many important applications and over the past decade, a wide variety of techniques have been studied for building such models. In this extended abstract of our 2014 AI Journal article of the same title, we summarize existing models and describe new model families and various extensions. In a comprehensive empirical analyis using 11 algorithms and 35 instance distributions spanning a wide range of hard combinatorial problems, we demonstrate that our new models yield substantially better runtime predictions than previous approaches in terms of their generalization to new problem instances, to new algorithms from a parameterized space, and to both simultaneously.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Freiburg", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Frank Hutter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hutter:Frank", "Lin Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Lin", "Holger Hoos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoos:Holger", "Kevin Leyton-Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leyton=Brown:Kevin"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 5}
