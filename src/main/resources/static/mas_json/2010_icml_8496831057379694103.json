In this paper, we analyze a class of online learning algorithms based on fixed potentials and non-linearized losses, which yields algorithms with implicit update rules. We show how to efficiently compute these updates, and we prove regret bounds for the algorithms. We apply our formulation to several special cases where our approach has benefits over existing online learning methods. In particular, we provide improved algorithms and bounds for the online metric learning problem, and show improved robustness for online linear prediction problems. Results over a variety of data sets demonstrate the advantages of our framework.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Brian Kulis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kulis:Brian", "Peter L.
