When performing motion estimation (ME) in the HB structure, the temporal distance between the current frame and reference frame(s) can be large (up to 32 frames apart). This limits the performance of fast search algorithm as larger search window is often necessary. Extensive experiments showed that popular fast suboptimal block ME algorithms are ineffective at tracking large motions across several frames. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Lacing which integrates well with any fast block ME techniques to significantly improve the motion prediction accuracy in quality of the motion-compensated frame and also result in smoother motion vector fields with lower entropy.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research", "Agency for Science, Technology and Research"], "authors": ["Wei Siong Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wei_Siong", "Yih Han Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Yih_Han", "Jo Yew Tham.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tham:Jo_Yew", "Kwong Huang Goh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goh:Kwong_Huang", "Dajun Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Dajun"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
