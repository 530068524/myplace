If preference lists are truncated and contain ties, finding a stable matching with maximal size is computationally difficult. We address this problem using a local search technique, based on Adaptive Search and present experimental evidence that this approach is much more efficient than state-of-the-art exact and approximate methods. Moreover, parallel versions (particularly versions with communication) improve performance so much that very large and hard instances can be solved quickly.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of \u00c9vora", "University of Padua", "IBM", "University Paris 1/CRI", "University Paris 1/CRI"], "authors": ["Danny Munera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munera:Danny", "Daniel Diaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diaz:Daniel", "Salvador Abreu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abreu:Salvador", "Francesca Rossi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rossi:Francesca", "Vijay A.
