While previous studies assumed a noise-free environment or a noisy monotone submodular objective function, this paper considers a more realistic and general situation where the evaluation of a subset is a noisy monotone function (not necessarily submodular), with both multiplicative and additive noises. To understand the impact of the noise, we firstly show the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm and POSS, two powerful algorithms for noise-free subset selection, in the noisy environments. We then propose to incorporate a noise-aware strategy into POSS, resulting in the new PONSS algorithm. We prove that PONSS can achieve a better approximation ratio under some assumption such as i.i.d. noise distribution. The empirical results on influence maximization and sparse regression problems show the superior performance of PONSS.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Science and Technology of China", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "University of Science and Technology of China", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Chao Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Chao", "Jing-Cheng Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Jing=Cheng", "Yang Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu_0001:Yang", "Ke Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Ke", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "pages": 11}
