In stark contrast, biological neural networks continually adapt to changing domains, possibly by leveraging complex molecular machinery to solve many tasks simultaneously. In this study, we introduce intelligent synapses that bring some of this biological complexity into artificial neural networks. Each synapse accumulates task relevant information over time, and exploits this information to rapidly store new memories without forgetting old ones. We evaluate our approach on continual learning of classification tasks, and show that it dramatically reduces forgetting while maintaining computational efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Friedemann Zenke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zenke:Friedemann", "Ben Poole.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poole:Ben", "Surya Ganguli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganguli:Surya"], "pages": 9}
