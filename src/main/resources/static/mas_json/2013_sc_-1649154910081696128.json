One common practice employed by developers without an advanced background in numerical analysis is using the highest available precision. While more robust, this can degrade program performance significantly. In this paper we present  Precimonious , a dynamic program analysis tool to assist developers in tuning the precision of floating-point programs.  Precimonious  performs a search on the types of the floating-point program variables trying to lower their precision subject to accuracy constraints and performance goals. Our tool recommends a type instantiation that uses lower precision while producing an accurate enough answer without causing exceptions. We evaluate  Precimonious  on several widely used functions from the GNU Scientific Library, two NAS Parallel Benchmarks, and three other numerical programs. For most of the programs analyzed,  Precimonious  reduces precision, which results in performance improvements as high as 41%.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Cindy Rubio-Gonz\u00e1lez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubio=Gonz=aacute=lez:Cindy", "Cuong Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen_0001:Cuong", "Hong Diep Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hong_Diep", "James Demmel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demmel:James", "William Kahan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kahan:William", "Koushik Sen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sen:Koushik", "David H.
