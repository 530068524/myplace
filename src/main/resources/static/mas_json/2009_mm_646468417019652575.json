Users hand gestures are recognized by capturing the motion-path while they draw different symbols in the air. In order to capture the motion-path, we use infra-red camera's IR sensing capability. The IR camera tracks the infra-red emitter attached to the user's hand gloves and produces a sequence of motion-points, which are then analyzed syntactically to recognize the intended hand gesture. The recognized gesture is used to interact with the intelligent environment for accessing various services. Toggling a lamp switch, changing the light intensity, and playing/pausing a movie are few examples where we have integrated the gesture-based interaction. Our experiment shows that the proposed gesture recognition technique is robust and its use in the smart home environment is interesting and appealing to the people.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "IKERLAN-IK4 Tec ... r, Spain, Spain"], "authors": ["Abu Saleh Md.
