Unfortunately, existing GPU virtualization approaches are still suboptimal in performance and full feature support.\n\nThis paper introduces gVirt, a product level GPU virtualization implementation with: 1) full GPU virtualization running native graphics driver in guest, and 2) mediated pass-through that achieves both good performance and scalability, and also secure isolation among guests. gVirt presents a virtual full-fledged GPU to each VM. VMs can directly access performance-critical resources, without intervention from the hypervisor in most cases, while privileged operations from guest are trap-and-emulated at minimal cost. Experiments demonstrate that gVirt can achieve up to 95% native performance for GPU intensive workloads, and scale well up to 7 VMs.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Kun Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Kun", "Yaozu Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Yaozu", "David Cowperthwaite.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cowperthwaite:David"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
