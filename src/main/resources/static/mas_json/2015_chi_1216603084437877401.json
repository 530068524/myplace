{"title": "ShapeClip: Towards Rapid Prototyping with Shape-Changing Displays for Designers.", "fields": ["clipping", "rapid prototyping", "scalability", "modular design", "electronics"], "abstract": "This paper presents ShapeClip: a modular tool capable of transforming any computer screen into a z-actuating shape-changing display. This enables designers to produce dynamic physical forms by \"clipping\" actuators onto screens. ShapeClip displays are portable, scalable, fault-tolerant, and support runtime re-arrangement. Users are not required to have knowledge of electronics or programming, and can develop motion designs with presentation software, image editors, or web-technologies. To evaluate ShapeClip we carried out a full-day workshop with expert designers. Participants were asked to generate shape-changing designs and then construct them using ShapeClip. ShapeClip enabled participants to rapidly and successfully transform their ideas into functional systems.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["John Hardy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardy:John", "Christian Weichel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weichel:Christian", "Faisal Taher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taher:Faisal", "John Vidler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vidler:John", "Jason Alexander.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alexander:Jason"], "pages": 10}
