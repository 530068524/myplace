{"title": "Consistency of weighted majority votes.", "fields": ["bayesian probability", "finitary", "voting", "learning theory", "frequentist inference"], "abstract": "We revisit from a statistical learning perspective the classical decision-theoretic problem of weighted expert voting. In particular, we examine the consistency (both asymptotic and finitary) of the optimal Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority and related rules. In the case of known expert competence levels, we give sharp error estimates for the optimal rule. When the competence levels are unknown, they must be empirically estimated. We provide frequentist and Bayesian analyses for this situation. Some of our proof techniques are non-standard and may be of independent interest. The bounds we derive are nearly optimal, and several challenging open problems are posed.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Daniel Berend.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berend:Daniel", "Aryeh Kontorovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kontorovich:Aryeh"], "pages": 9}
