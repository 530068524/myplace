An aspect largely neglected so far is that of temporality, i.e. how the quality of users' experience develops over time. This paper presents an in-depth, five-week ethnographic study that followed 6 individuals during an actual purchase of the Apple iPhone\". We found prolonged use to be motivated by different qualities than the ones that provided positive initial experiences. Overall, while early experiences seemed to relate mostly to hedonic aspects of product use, prolonged experiences became increasingly more tied to aspects reflecting how the product becomes meaningful in one's life. Based on the findings, we promote three directions for CHI practice: designing for meaningful mediation, designing for daily rituals, and designing for the self.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Eindhoven University of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "authors": ["Evangelos Karapanos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Karapanos:Evangelos", "John Zimmerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmerman:John", "Jodi Forlizzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Forlizzi:Jodi", "Jean-Bernard Martens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martens:Jean=Bernard"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
