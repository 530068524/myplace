{"title": "Zero-Shot Learning via Class-Conditioned Deep Generative Models.", "fields": ["transduction", "small number", "discriminative model", "autoencoder", "generative model"], "abstract": "We present a deep generative model for learning to predict classes not seen at training time. Unlike most existing methods for this problem, that represent each class as a point (via a semantic embedding), we represent each seen/unseen class using a class-specific latent-space distribution, conditioned on class attributes. We use these latent-space distributions as a prior for a supervised variational autoencoder (VAE), which also facilitates learning highly discriminative feature representations for the inputs. The entire framework is learned end-to-end using only the seen-class training data. The model infers corresponding attributes of a test image by maximizing the VAE lower bound; the inferred attributes may be linked to labels not seen when training. We further extend our model to a (1) semi-supervised/transductive setting by leveraging unlabeled unseen-class data via an unsupervised learning module, and (2) few-shot learning where we also have a small number of labeled inputs from the unseen classes. We compare our model with several state-of-the-art methods through a comprehensive set of experiments on a variety of benchmark data sets.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Wenlin Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Wenlin", "Yunchen Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Yunchen", "Vinay Kumar Verma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Verma:Vinay_Kumar", "Kai Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Kai", "Yizhe Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yizhe", "Changyou Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Changyou", "Piyush Rai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rai:Piyush", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
