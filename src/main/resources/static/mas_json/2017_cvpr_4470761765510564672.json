However, as obtaining per-pixel annotations is expensive, performances of CNNs in semantic image segmentation are not fully exploited. This work significantly increases segmentation accuracy of CNNs by learning from an Image Descriptions in the Wild (IDW) dataset. Unlike previous image captioning datasets, where captions were manually and densely annotated, images and their descriptions in IDW are automatically downloaded from Internet without any manual cleaning and refinement. An IDW-CNN is proposed to jointly train IDW and existing image segmentation dataset such as Pascal VOC 2012 (VOC). It has two appealing properties. First, knowledge from different datasets can be fully explored and transferred from each other to improve performance. Second, segmentation accuracy in VOC can be constantly increased when selecting more data from IDW. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of IDW-CNN, which outperforms existing best-performing system by 12% on VOC12 test set.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Sun Yat-sen University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Guangrun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Guangrun", "Ping Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo_0002:Ping", "Liang Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Liang", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang"], "pages": 9}
