{"title": "Efficient Sampling for Learning Sparse Additive Models in High Dimensions.", "fields": ["minimax approximation algorithm", "bounded function", "univariate", "additive model", "randomized algorithm"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning sparse additive models, i.e., functions of the form: f(x) = \u03a3l\u2208S \u03d5l(xl), x \u2208 \u211dd from point queries of f. Here S is an unknown subset of coordinate variables with |S| = k \u226a d. Assuming \u03d5l's to be smooth, we propose a set of points at which to sample f and an efficient randomized algorithm that recovers a uniform approximation to each unknown \u03d5l. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of our scheme along with sample complexity bounds. Our algorithm utilizes recent results from compressive sensing theory along with a novel convex quadratic program for recovering robust uniform approximations to univariate functions, from point queries corrupted with arbitrary bounded noise. Lastly we theoretically analyze the impact of noise - either arbitrary but bounded, or stochastic - on the performance of our algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Hemant Tyagi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tyagi:Hemant", "Bernd G\u00e4rtner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=auml=rtner:Bernd", "Andreas Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause_0001:Andreas"], "pages": 9}
