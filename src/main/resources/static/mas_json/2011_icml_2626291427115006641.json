We formulate this problem in terms of data-dependent regularization in Vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (Micchelli & Pontil, 2005) which elegantly extend familiar scalar-valued kernel methods to the general setting where Y has a Hilbert space structure. Our methods provide a natural extension of Manifold Regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) algorithms to also exploit output inter-dependencies while enforcing smoothness with respect to input data geometry. We propose a class of matrix-valued kernels which allow efficient implementations of our algorithms via the use of numerical solvers for Sylvester matrix equations. On multi-label image annotation and text classification problems, we find favorable empirical comparisons against several competing alternatives.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "IBM"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ha Quang Minh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Minh:Ha_Quang", "Vikas Sindhwani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sindhwani:Vikas"], "pages": 8}
