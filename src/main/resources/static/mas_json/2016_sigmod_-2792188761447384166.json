{"title": "Wander Join: Online Aggregation for Joins.", "fields": ["online aggregation", "recursive join", "hash join", "joins", "sort merge join"], "abstract": "Joins are expensive, and online aggregation over joins was proposed to mitigate the cost, which offers a nice and flexible tradeoff between query efficiency and accuracy in a continuous, online fashion. However, the state-of-the-art approach, in both internal and external memory, is based on ripple join, which is still very expensive and may also need very restrictive assumptions (e.g., tuples in a table are stored in random order). We introduce a new approach, wander join, to the online aggregation problem by performing random walks over the underlying join graph. We have also implemented and tested wander join in the latest PostgreSQL.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Utah", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Feifei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Feifei", "Bin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0003:Bin", "Ke Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Ke", "Zhuoyue Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zhuoyue"], "pages": 4}
