{"title": "Constants Count: Practical Improvements to Oblivious RAM.", "fields": ["bandwidth", "computer security", "oblivious ram", "computation", "cryptographic primitive"], "abstract": "Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a cryptographic primitive that hides memory access patterns as seen by untrusted storage. This paper proposes Ring ORAM, the most bandwidth-efficient ORAM scheme for the small client storage setting in both theory and practice. Ring ORAM is the first tree-based ORAM whose bandwidth is independent of the ORAM bucket size, a property that unlocks multiple performance improvements. First, Ring ORAM's overall bandwidth is 2.3\u00d7 to 4\u00d7 better than Path ORAM, the prior-art scheme for small client storage. Second, if memory can perform simple untrusted computation, Ring ORAM achieves constant online bandwidth (\u223c 60\u00d7 improvement over Path ORAM for practical parameters). As a case study, we show Ring ORAM speeds up program completion time in a secure processor by 1.5\u00d7 relative to Path ORAM. On the theory side, Ring ORAM features a tighter and significantly simpler analysis than Path ORAM.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "Cornell University"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Ling Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren_0001:Ling", "Christopher W.
