This coordination process is called power shifting. Meanwhile, recent studies have revealed that on/off links can save network power in HPC systems. Future HPC systems will thus adopt on/off links in addition to power shifting. This paper explores power shifting in interconnection networks with on/off links. Given that on/off links keep network power low at application runtime, we can transfer appreciable quantities of power budgets on networks to other devices before an application runs. We thus propose a profile-based power shifting technique that allows HPC users to transfer the power budget remaining on networks to other devices at the time of job dispatch. Experimental results show that the proposed technique appreciably improves application performance under various power constraints.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Electro-Communications", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Shinobu Miwa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miwa:Shinobu", "Hiroshi Nakamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakamura:Hiroshi"], "pages": 11}
