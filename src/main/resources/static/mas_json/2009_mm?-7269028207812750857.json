In this paper, we discuss a privacy-protected video surveillance system that makes use of the JPEG XR standard. This standard offers a low-complexity solution for the scalable coding of high-resolution images. To address privacy concerns, face regions are detected and subsequently scrambled in the transform domain, taking into account the spatial and quality scalability features of JPEG XR. A number of experiments were conducted in order to investigate the efficiency of our video surveillance system, considering bit stream overhead and security aspects.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Hosik Sohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sohn:Hosik", "Wesley De Neve.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neve:Wesley_De", "Yong Man Ro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ro:Yong_Man"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
