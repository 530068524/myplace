Using a Bayesian framework, we address this challenge by using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation for the reward function, and show that most of the previous IRL algorithms can be modeled into our framework. We also present a gradient method for the MAP estimation based on the (sub)differentiability of the posterior distribution. We show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the performance of the proposed method to those of the previous algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Jaedeug Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Jaedeug", "Kee-Eung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Kee=Eung"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
