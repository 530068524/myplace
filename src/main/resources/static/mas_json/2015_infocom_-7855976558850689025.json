{"title": "How bad are the rogues' impact on enterprise 802.11 network performance?", "fields": ["rogue access point", "network performance", "simple network management protocol", "hop", "program optimization"], "abstract": "Enterprise 802.11 Network (EWLAN) is an important infrastructure to the Mobile Internet, but its performance is being significantly impacted by the ever-increasing Rogue access points (RAPs). For example, in the university EWLAN we studied, the number of RAPs is more than seven times that of the enterprise APs. In this paper, we propose a generic methodology to measure RAP's carrier sense interference and hidden terminal interference, and it only uses readily available SNMP metrics, without any additional measurement hardware. Our results show that, on average, the carrier sense interference due to RAPs causes only 5% access delay increase at the MAC layer, because of careful engineering and software optimization. However, hidden terminal interference due to RAPs causes (a much more severe) up to 30% MAC layer loss rate increase on average, because no existing approach has explicitly dealt with the hidden terminal impact from rogue APs. Overall, the RAP interference would increase the IP layer delay at the WiFi hop by up to 50%.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "infocom", "authors": ["Kaixin Sui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sui:Kaixin", "Youjian Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Youjian", "Dan Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Dan", "Zimu Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Zimu"], "pages": 9}
