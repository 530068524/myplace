{"title": "LGBT Parents and Social Media: Advocacy, Privacy, and Disclosure during Shifting Social Movements.", "fields": ["social media", "transgender", "social movement", "social network", "collective responsibility"], "abstract": "Increasing numbers of American parents identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). Shifting social movements are beginning to achieve greater recognition for LGBT parents and more rights for their families; however, LGBT parents still experience stigma and judgment in a variety of social contexts. We interviewed 28 LGBT parents to investigate how they navigate their online environments in light of these societal shifts. We find that 1) LGBT parents use social media sites to detect disapproval and identify allies within their social networks; 2) LGBT parents become what we call incidental advocates, when everyday social media posts are perceived as advocacy work even when not intended as such; and 3) for LGBT parents, privacy is a complex and collective responsibility, shared with children, partners, and families. We consider the complexities of LGBT parents' online disclosures in the context of shifting social movements and discuss the importance of supporting individual and collective privacy boundaries in these contexts.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Lindsay Blackwell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blackwell:Lindsay", "Jean Hardy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardy:Jean", "Tawfiq Ammari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ammari:Tawfiq", "Tiffany C.
