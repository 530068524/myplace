To help filter promising ideas, community voting is often included as part of the pipeline but the outcome of the voting rarely aligns with the ideas selected by the team. To address this problem, we introduce a new scoring model for increasing the findability of promising ideas within idea pipelines. In the model, each participant need only score a subset of the ideas, ideas are scored independently, and the individual scores can be aggregated. We tested the model on an authentic data set and found our model filters ideas chosen by an evaluation team better than community votes.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Anbang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Anbang", "Brian P.
