There are methods that formalize multi-object dynamics using relational representations, but these methods are not sufficiently compact for real-world robotics. We present a physics-based approach that exploits modern simulation tools to efficiently parameterize physical dynamics. Our results show that this representation can result in much faster learning, by virtue of its strong but appropriate inductive bias in physical environments.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Jonathan Scholz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Scholz:Jonathan", "Martin Levihn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levihn:Martin", "Charles Lee Isbell Jr......http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Isbell_Jr=:Charles_Lee", "David Wingate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wingate:David"], "pages": 9}
