{"title": "Messages behind the sound: real-time hidden acoustic signal capture with smartphones.", "fields": ["decoding methods", "channel", "active listening", "audio signal", "masking"], "abstract": "With the ever-increasing use of smart devices, recent research endeavors have led to unobtrusive screen-camera communication channel designs, which allow simultaneous screen viewing and hidden screen-camera communication. Such practices, albeit innovative and effective, require well-controlled alignment of camera and screen and obstacle-free access.   In this paper, we develop Dolphin, a novel form of real-time acoustics-based dual-channel communication, which uses a speaker and the microphones on off-the-shelf smartphones to achieve concurrent audible and hidden communication. By leveraging masking effects of the human auditory system and readily available audio signals in our daily lives, Dolphin ensures real-time unobtrusive speaker-microphone data communication without affecting the primary audio-hearing experience for human users, while, at the same time, it overcomes the main limitations of existing screen-camera links. Our Dolphin prototype, built using off-the-shelf smartphones, realizes real-time hidden communication, supports up to 8-meter signal capture distance and \u00b190\u00b0 listening angle and achieves decoding rate above 80% without error correction. Further, it achieves average data rates of up to 500bps while keeping the decoding rate above 95% within a distance of 1m.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Wuhan University", "University at Buffalo", "Wuhan University", "Wuhan University", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Qian Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Qian", "Kui Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren_0001:Kui", "Man Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Man", "Tao Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Tao", "Dimitrios Koutsonikolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koutsonikolas:Dimitrios", "Lu Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Lu"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
