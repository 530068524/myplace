Our research investigates how social computing might support citizens co-design their transit service. We conducted a field study with public transit riders, exploring the issues and controversies that reveal conflicting communities. Our analyses revealed three insights. First, encourage citizens to share what they see as the rationale for current service offerings. Second, encourage citizens to share the consequences of current services and of proposed changes and new designs. Third, focus on producing a shared citizen and service provider understanding of what the goals and mission of the public service should be.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Daisy Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Daisy", "John Zimmerman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmerman:John", "Tad Hirsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirsch:Tad"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
