Building from in-depth fieldwork and participatory design sessions, we developed vSked, an interactive and collaborative visual scheduling system designed for elementary school classrooms. We evaluated vSked in situ in one autism-specific classroom over three weeks. In this paper, we present the design principles, technical solution, and results from this successful deployment. Use of vSked resulted in reductions in staff effort required to use visual supports. vSked also resulted in improvements in the perceived quality and quantity of communication and social interactions in the classroom.", "citation": "Citations (128)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Irvine", "Orange County D ... lerton, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Sen H.
