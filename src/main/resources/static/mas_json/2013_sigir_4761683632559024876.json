To improve users' browse experiences and facilitate the web directory construction, in this paper, we propose a novel browse system called Social Web Directory (SWD for short) by integrating web directories and social bookmarks. In SWD, (1) web pages are automatically categorized to a hierarchical structure to be retrieved efficiently, and (2) the popular web pages, hottest tags, and expert users in each category are ranked to help users find information more conveniently. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SWD system.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Tan Tao Univers ... ong An, Vietnam"], "authors": ["Hao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Hao", "Yunjun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yunjun", "Lu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lu", "Rui Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Rui", "Kevin Chiew.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiew:Kevin", "Qinming He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Qinming"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
