{"title": "Time-Data Tradeoffs by Aggressive Smoothing.", "fields": ["convex optimization", "smoothing", "sample complexity", "computation", "estimator"], "abstract": "This paper proposes a tradeoff between sample complexity and computation time that applies to statistical estimators based on convex optimization. As the amount of data increases, we can smooth optimization problems more and more aggressively to achieve accurate estimates more quickly. This work provides theoretical and experimental evidence of this tradeoff for a class of regularized linear inverse problems.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["John J.
