Different methodologies for data storage and query processing have been proposed. As the availability of management systems grows, the research on analytics of uncertain data is gaining in importance. Similar to the challenges faced in the field of data management, algorithms for uncertain data mining also have a high performance degradation compared to their certain algorithms. To overcome the problem of performance degradation, the MCDB approach was developed for uncertain data management based on the possible world scenario. As this methodology shows significant performance and scalability enhancement, we adopt this method for the field of mining on uncertain data. In this paper, we introduce a clustering methodology for uncertain data and illustrate current issues with this approach within the field of clustering uncertain data.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["Database Techno ... resden, Dresden", "Database Techno ... resden, Dresden", "Database Techno ... resden, Dresden", "Database Techno ... resden, Dresden", "Database Techno ... resden, Dresden"], "authors": ["Peter Benjamin Volk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Volk:Peter_Benjamin", "Frank Rosenthal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rosenthal:Frank", "Martin Hahmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hahmann:Martin", "Dirk Habich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habich:Dirk", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
