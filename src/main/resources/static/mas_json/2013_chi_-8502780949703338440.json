We draw from Goffman's theatrical metaphor and Hogan's exhibition approach to explore how people manage their personal collection of social media data over time. We conducted a qualitative study of 13 participants to reveal their day-to-day decision-making about producing and curating digital traces on Facebook. Their goals and strategies showed that people experience the Facebook platform as consisting of three different functional regions: a  performance region  for managing recent data and impression management, an  exhibition region  for longer term presentation of self-image, and a  personal region  for archiving meaningful facets of life. Further, users' need for presenting and archiving data in these three regions is mediated by temporality. These findings trigger a discussion of how to design social media that support these dynamic and sometimes conflicting needs.", "citation": "Citations (142)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Xuan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xuan", "Niloufar Salehi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salehi:Niloufar", "Sasha Naranjit.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naranjit:Sasha", "Sara Alwaalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alwaalan:Sara", "Stephen Voida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voida:Stephen", "Dan Cosley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cosley:Dan"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
