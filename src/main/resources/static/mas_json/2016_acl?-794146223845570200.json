{"title": "Learning-Based Single-Document Summarization with Compression and Anaphoricity Constraints.", "fields": ["sentence", "automatic summarization", "discriminative model", "pronoun", "rouge"], "abstract": "We present a discriminative model for single-document summarization that integrally combines compression and anaphoricity constraints. Our model selects textual units to include in the summary based on a rich set of sparse features whose weights are learned on a large corpus. We allow for the deletion of content within a sentence when that deletion is licensed by compression rules; in our framework, these are implemented as dependencies between subsentential units of text. Anaphoricity constraints then improve cross-sentence coherence by guaranteeing that, for each pronoun included in the summary, the pronoun's antecedent is included as well or the pronoun is rewritten as a full mention. When trained end-to-end, our final system outperforms prior work on both ROUGE as well as on human judgments of linguistic quality.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Greg Durrett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durrett:Greg", "Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Berg=Kirkpatrick:Taylor", "Dan Klein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klein:Dan"], "pages": -1}
