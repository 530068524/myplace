The Symphony prototype has been built on top of Microsoft's Bing infrastructure. While Symphony naturally makes use of the customization capabilities exposed by Bing, its distinguishing feature is the capability it provides to the application creator to combine their proprietary data and domain expertise with content obtained from Bing. They can also integrate specialized data obtained from web services to enhance the richness of their applications. Finally, Symphony is targeted at non-developers and provides cloud services for the creation and deployment of applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["John C.
