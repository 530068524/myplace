{"title": "A Platform for Building New Human-Computer Interface Systems that Support Online Automatic Recognition of Audio-Gestural Commands.", "fields": ["software", "modalities", "reuse", "gesture", "gesture recognition"], "abstract": "We introduce a new framework to build human-computer interfaces that provide online automatic audio-gestural command recognition. The overall system allows the construction of a multimodal interface that recognizes user input expressed naturally as audio commands and manual gestures, captured by sensors such as Kinect. It includes a component for acquiring multimodal user data which is used as input to a module responsible for training audio-gestural models. These models are employed by the automatic recognition component, which supports online recognition of audio-visual modalities. The overall framework is exemplified by a working system use case. This demonstrates the potential of the overall software platform, which can be employed to build other new human-computer interaction systems. Moreover, users may populate libraries of models and/or data, that can be shared in the network. In this way users may reuse or extend existing systems.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens"], "authors": ["Nikolaos Kardaris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kardaris:Nikolaos", "Isidoros Rodomagoulakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rodomagoulakis:Isidoros", "Vassilis Pitsikalis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitsikalis:Vassilis", "Antonis Arvanitakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arvanitakis:Antonis", "Petros Maragos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maragos:Petros"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 5}
