We have enhanced the H.264/AVC encoder with our proposed adaptation strategies in order to reduce video size by cropping individual frames in an intermediary node prior to transmitting that video to heterogeneous devices. In this regard, we exploit the sliced architecture of the video frames within the first version of the H.264/AVC specification and devise different slicing strategies. The compressed-domain bitstream modification is performed at the intermediary nodes, avoiding the need for any cascaded operations. Here, we briefly present our adaptation scheme as well as evaluation results showing the effectiveness of the slicing strategies on the bitrate reduction and processing time. A comparison of our approach with an existing cropping scheme is also presented.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa", "University of Ottawa"], "authors": ["Sharmeen Shahabuddin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shahabuddin:Sharmeen", "Razib Iqbal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iqbal:Razib", "Ali A.
