{"title": "Blind Attacks on Machine Learners.", "fields": ["ciphertext only attack", "convergence", "minimax", "estimator", "training set"], "abstract": "The importance of studying the robustness of learners to malicious data is well established. While much work has been done establishing both robust estimators and effective data injection attacks when the attacker is omniscient, the ability of an attacker to provably harm learning while having access to little information is largely unstudied. We study the potential of a \u201cblind attacker\u201d to provably limit a learner\u2019s performance by data injection attack without observing the learner\u2019s training set or any parameter of the distribution from which it is drawn. We provide examples of simple yet effective attacks in two settings: firstly, where an \u201cinformed learner\u201d knows the strategy chosen by the attacker, and secondly, where a \u201cblind learner\u201d knows only the proportion of malicious data and some family to which the malicious distribution chosen by the attacker belongs. For each attack, we analyze minimax rates of convergence and establish lower bounds on the learner\u2019s minimax risk, exhibiting limits on a learner\u2019s ability to learn under data injection attack even when the attacker is \u201cblind\u201d.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "authors": ["Alex Beatson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beatson:Alex", "Zhaoran Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhaoran", "Han Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Han"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
