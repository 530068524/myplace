At Crypto 2005, Coron  et al. showed that security in the random oracle model implies security in the ideal cipher model; namely they showed that a random oracle can be replaced by a block cipher-based construction, and the resulting scheme remains secure in the ideal cipher model. The other direction was left as an open problem,  i.e. constructing an ideal cipher from a random oracle. In this paper we solve this open problem and show that the Feistel construction with 6 rounds is enough to obtain an ideal cipher; we also show that 5 rounds are insufficient by providing a simple attack. This contrasts with the classical Luby-Rackoff result that 4 rounds are necessary and sufficient to obtain a (strong) pseudo-random permutation from a pseudo-random function.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Luxembourg", "University of Luxembourg", "University of Versailles,", "University of V ... d Orange Labs,"], "authors": ["Jean-S\u00e9bastien Coron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Coron:Jean=S=eacute=bastien", "Jacques Patarin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patarin:Jacques", "Yannick Seurin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seurin:Yannick"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2008", "pages": 20}
