Inadvertently, many valid matches are discarded due to repetitive texture or large baseline between view points. To address this problem, matching should consider both feature appearances and geometric fitting errors. We jointly solve feature matching and multi-model fitting problems by optimizing one energy. The formulation is based on our generalization of the assignment problem and its efficient min-cost-max-flow solver. Our approach significantly increases the number of correctly matched features, improves the accuracy of fitted models, and is robust to larger baselines.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Western Ontario", "University of Western Ontario"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Hossam N.
