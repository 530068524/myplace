{"title": "Closed-form throughput expressions for CSMA networks with collisions and hidden terminals.", "fields": [], "abstract": "We present a novel modeling approach to derive closed-form throughput expressions for CSMA networks with hidden terminals. The key modeling principle is to break the interdependence of events in a wireless network using conditional expressions that capture the effect of a specific factor each, yet preserve the required dependences when combined together. Different from existing models that use numerical aggregation techniques, our approach is the first to jointly characterize the three main critical factors affecting flow throughput (referred to as hidden terminals, information asymmetry and flow-in-the-middle) within a single analytical expression. We have developed a symbolic implementation of the model, that we use for validation against realistic simulations and experiments with real wireless hardware, observing high model accuracy in the evaluated scenarios. The derived closed-form expressions enable new analytical studies of capacity and protocol performance that would not be possible with prior models. We illustrate this through an application of network utility maximization in complex networks with collisions, hidden terminals, asymmetric interference and flow-in-the-middle instances. Despite that such problematic scenarios make utility maximization a challenging problem, the model-based optimization yields vast fairness gains and an average per-flow throughput gain higher than 500% with respect to 802.11 in the evaluated networks.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Rice University", "Rice University"], "authors": ["Bruno Nardelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nardelli:Bruno", "Edward W.
