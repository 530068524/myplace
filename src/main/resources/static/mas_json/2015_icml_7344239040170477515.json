But how can we prove superiority without testing the new policy? To answer this question, we introduce the G-SCOPE algorithm that evaluates a new policy based on data generated by the existing policy. Our algorithm is both computationally and sample efficient because it greedily learns to exploit factored structure in the dynamics of the environment. We present a finite sample analysis of our approach and show through experiments that the algorithm scales well on high-dimensional problems with few samples.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Assaf Hallak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hallak:Assaf", "Fran\u00e7ois Schnitzler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schnitzler:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Timothy Arthur Mann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mann:Timothy_Arthur", "Shie Mannor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mannor:Shie"], "pages": 9}
