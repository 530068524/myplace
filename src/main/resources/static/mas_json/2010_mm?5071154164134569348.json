{"title": "Multimedia cross-platform content distribution for mobile peer-to-peer networks using network coding.", "fields": ["multi frequency network", "mobile web", "radio access network", "mobile database", "mobile search"], "abstract": "This paper is looking into the possibility of multimedia content distribution over multiple mobile platforms forming wireless peer--to--peer networks. State of the art mobile networks are centralized and base station or access point oriented. Current developments break ground for device to device communication. In this paper we will introduce a mobile application that runs on Symbian as well as iPhone/iPod devices and is able to exchange multimedia content in a point to multipoint fashion. The mobile application coined PictureViewer can convey pictures from one source device to many neighboring devices using a wireless 802.11 network together with network coding and user cooperation. The advantage of network coding in this context is that the source devices only need a minimal amount of knowledge about the sinks received packets and therefore only a minimal amount of feedback is needed to ensure reliable data delivery.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics", "Aalborg University"], "authors": ["Morten Videb\u00e6k Pedersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pedersen:Morten_Videb=aelig=k", "Janus Heide.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heide:Janus", "P\u00e9ter Vingelmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vingelmann:P=eacute=ter", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Bl\u00e1zovics.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bl=aacute=zovics:L=aacute=szl=oacute=", "Frank H.
