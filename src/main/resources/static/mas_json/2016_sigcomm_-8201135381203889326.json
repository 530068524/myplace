{"title": "NUMFabric: Fast and Flexible Bandwidth Allocation in Datacenters.", "fields": ["network packet", "distributed algorithm", "dynamic bandwidth allocation", "computer network", "bandwidth allocation", "computer science", "network topology"], "abstract": "We present xFabric, a novel datacenter transport design that provides flexible and fast bandwidth allocation control. xFabric is flexible: it enables operators to specify how bandwidth is allocated amongst contending flows to optimize for different service-level objectives such as minimizing flow completion times, weighted allocations, different notions of fairness, etc. xFabric is also very fast, it converges to the specified allocation one-to-two order of magnitudes faster than prior schemes. Underlying xFabric, is a novel distributed algorithm that uses in-network packet scheduling to rapidly solve general network utility maximization problems for bandwidth allocation. We evaluate xFabric using realistic datacenter topologies and highly dynamic workloads and show that it is able to provide flexibility and fast convergence in such stressful environments.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Stanford University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kanthi Nagaraj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagaraj:Kanthi", "Dinesh Bharadia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bharadia:Dinesh", "Hongzi Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Hongzi", "Sandeep Chinchali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chinchali:Sandeep", "Mohammad Alizadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alizadeh:Mohammad", "Sachin Katti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katti:Sachin"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
