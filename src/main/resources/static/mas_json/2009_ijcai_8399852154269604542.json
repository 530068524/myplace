The goal is to identify a preference ordering with a binary-valued CP-net by guiding the user through a sequence of queries. Each example is a dominance test on some pair of outcomes. In this setting, we show that acyclic CP-nets are not learnable with equivalence queries alone, while they are learnable with the help of membership queries if the supplied examples are restricted to swaps. A similar property holds for tree CP-nets with arbitrary examples. In fact, membership queries allow us to provide attribute-efficient algorithms for which the query complexity is only logarithmic in the number of attributes. Such results highlight the utility of this model for eliciting CP-nets in large multi-attribute domains.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Montpellier", "University of Caen Lower Normandy"], "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Koriche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koriche:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric", "Bruno Zanuttini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zanuttini:Bruno"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
