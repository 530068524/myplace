We consider the specific setup where the distribution of the system\u2019s trajectories is unknown but the following two sources of information are available: (i) some \u201crough\u201d prior knowledge on the system\u2019s realisations; (ii) a set of \u201cincomplete\u201d observations of the system\u2019s trajectories. We propose a Bayesian methodological framework to build reduced-order models (ROMs) by exploiting these two sources of information. We emphasise that complementing the prior knowledge with the collected data provably enhances the knowledge of the distribution of the system\u2019s trajectories. We then propose an implementation of the proposed methodology based on Monte-Carlo methods. In this context, we show that standard ROM learning techniques, such e.g., proper orthogonal decomposition or dynamic mode decomposition, can be revisited and recast within the probabilistic framework considered in this paper. We illustrate the performance of the proposed approach by numerical results obtained for a standard geophysical model.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Osaka University", "University of Tokyo", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Naoya Takeishi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takeishi:Naoya", "Yoshinobu Kawahara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawahara:Yoshinobu", "Yasuo Tabei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tabei:Yasuo", "Takehisa Yairi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yairi:Takehisa"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
