{"title": "Object Capabilities and Isolation of Untrusted Web Applications.", "fields": ["mashup", "javascript", "language based security", "operational semantics", "web application"], "abstract": "A growing number of current web sites combine active content (applications) from untrusted sources, as in so-called mashups. The object-capability model provides an appealing approach for isolating untrusted content: if separate applications are provided disjoint capabilities, a sound object-capability framework should prevent untrusted applications from interfering with each other, without preventing interaction with the user or the hosting page. In developing language-based foundations for isolation proofs based on object-capability concepts, we identify a more general notion of authority safety that also implies resource isolation. After proving that capability safety implies authority safety, we show the applicability of our framework for a specific class of mashups. In addition to proving that a JavaScript subset based on Google Caja is capability safe, we prove that a more expressive subset of JavaScript is authority safe, even though it is not based on the object-capability model.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Sergio Maffeis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maffeis:Sergio", "John C.
