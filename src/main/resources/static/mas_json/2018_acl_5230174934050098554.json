{"title": "Embedding Learning Through Multilingual Concept Induction.", "fields": ["sentiment analysis", "machine learning", "vector space", "embedding", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "We present a new method for estimating vector space representations of words: embedding learning by concept induction. We test this method on a highly parallel corpus and learn semantic representations of words in 1259 different languages in a single common space. An extensive experimental evaluation on crosslingual word similarity and sentiment analysis indicates that concept-based multilingual embedding learning performs better than previous approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"], "authors": ["Philipp Dufter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dufter:Philipp", "Mengjie Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Mengjie", "Martin Schmitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmitt:Martin", "Alexander M.
