{"title": "Learning Active Learning from Data.", "fields": ["heuristics", "machine learning", "artificial intelligence", "active learning"], "abstract": "In this paper, we suggest a novel data-driven approach to active learning (AL). The key idea is to train a regressor that predicts the expected error reduction for a candidate sample in a particular learning state. By formulating the query selection procedure as a regression problem we are not restricted to working with existing AL heuristics; instead, we learn strategies based on experience from previous AL outcomes. We show that a strategy can be learnt either from simple synthetic 2D datasets or from a subset of domain-specific data. Our method yields strategies that work well on real data from a wide range of domains.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "University of Bern", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ksenia Konyushkova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Konyushkova:Ksenia", "Raphael Sznitman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sznitman:Raphael", "Pascal Fua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fua:Pascal"], "pages": 11}
