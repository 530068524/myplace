Leveraging ideas from survival and event history analysis, we introduce a continuous-time regression modeling framework for network event data that can incorporate both time-dependent network statistics and time-varying regression coefficients. We also develop an efficient inference scheme that allows our approach to scale to large networks. On synthetic and real-world data, empirical results demonstrate that the proposed inference approach can accurately estimate the coefficients of the regression model, which is useful for interpreting the evolution of the network; furthermore, the learned model has systematically better predictive performance compared to standard baseline methods.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Duy Quang Vu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vu:Duy_Quang", "Arthur U.
