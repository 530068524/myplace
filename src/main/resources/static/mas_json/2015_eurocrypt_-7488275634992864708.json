{"title": "Quadratic Time, Linear Space Algorithms for Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization and Gaussian Sampling in Structured Lattices.", "fields": ["lattice", "gaussian", "orthogonalization", "linear space", "gram schmidt process", "time complexity"], "abstract": "A procedure for sampling lattice vectors is at the heart of many lattice constructions, and the algorithm of Klein (SODA 2000) and Gentry, Peikert, Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2008) is currently the one that produces the shortest vectors. But due to the fact that its most time-efficient (quadratic-time) variant requires the storage of the Gram-Schmidt basis, the asymptotic space requirements of this algorithm are the same for general and ideal lattices. The main result of the current work is a series of algorithms that ultimately lead to a sampling procedure producing the same outputs as the Klein/GPV one, but requiring only linear-storage when working on lattices used in ideal-lattice cryptography. The reduced storage directly leads to a reduction in key-sizes by a factor of \\(\\Omega (d)\\), and makes cryptographic constructions requiring lattice sampling much more suitable for practical applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Thales Communications"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Vadim Lyubashevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyubashevsky:Vadim", "Thomas Prest.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prest:Thomas"], "pages": 27}
