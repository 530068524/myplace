{"title": "Learning Structured Natural Language Representations for Semantic Parsing.", "fields": ["parser combinator", "semantic computing", "parsing", "semantic compression", "transition system"], "abstract": "We introduce a neural semantic parser that converts natural language utterances to intermediate representations in the form of predicate-argument structures, which are induced with a transition system and subsequently mapped to target domains. The semantic parser is trained end-to-end using annotated logical forms or their denotations. We obtain competitive results on various datasets. The induced predicate-argument structures shed light on the types of representations useful for semantic parsing and how these are different from linguistically motivated ones.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jianpeng Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng_0001:Jianpeng", "Siva Reddy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reddy:Siva", "Vijay Saraswat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saraswat:Vijay", "Mirella Lapata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lapata:Mirella"], "pages": 12}
