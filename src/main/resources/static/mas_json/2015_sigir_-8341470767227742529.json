{"title": "Location-Aware Model for News Events in Social Media.", "fields": ["social media", "computer science", "knowledge extraction", "internet privacy", "data mining"], "abstract": "Nowadays, social media services are being used extensively as news sources and for spreading information on real-world events. Several studies have focused on detecting those events and locating them geographically. However, in order to study real-world events, for example, finding relationships between locations or detecting high impact events based on their coverage, we need more suitable models to represent events. In this work we propose a simple model to represent real-world news events using two sources of information: the locations that are mentioned in the event (where the event occurs), and the locations of users that discuss or comment on it. We then characterize a country based on the amount of events in which that country is mentioned and also participates on the event. We show some applications of the model: we find clusters of news events based on the level of participation of countries, identifying global and impactful events in certain areas. Also, we show groups of similar countries, finding promising insights about their relationships. This model can be useful at finding unsuspected relations among countries based on the news coverage and country participation, identifying different levels of news coverage in the world, and finding bias in international news sources.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["PRISMA Research ...
