In this paper we argue that the user, not the ISP or the content provider, should decide how traffic is prioritized to and from the home. Home users know most about their preferences, and if they can express them well to the ISP, then both the ISP and user are better off. To test the idea we built a prototype that lets users express highlevel preferences that are translated to low-level semantics and used to control the network.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Yiannis Yiakoumis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yiakoumis:Yiannis", "Sachin Katti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katti:Sachin", "Te-Yuan Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Te=Yuan", "Nick McKeown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McKeown:Nick", "Kok-Kiong Yap.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yap:Kok=Kiong", "Ramesh Johari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johari:Ramesh"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2012", "pages": 6}
