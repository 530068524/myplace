Conventional selectional preference learning methods have usually focused on word-to-class relations, e.g., a verb selects as its subject a given nominal class. This paper extends previous work to word-to-word selectional preferences by using web-scale data. Experiments show that web-scale data improves statistical dependency parsing, particularly for long dependency relationships. There is no data like more data, performance improves log-linearly with the number of parameters (unique N-grams). More importantly, when operating on new domains, we show that using web-derived selectional preferences is essential for achieving robust performance.", "citation": "Citations (41)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Guangyou Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Guangyou", "Jun Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao_0001:Jun", "Kang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Kang", "Li Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Li"], "pages": 10}
