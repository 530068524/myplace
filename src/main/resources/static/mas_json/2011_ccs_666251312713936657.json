Applying a systematic evaluation methodology to 15 current CAPTCHA schemes from popular web sites, we find that 13 are vulnerable to automated attacks. Based on this evaluation, we identify a series of recommendations for CAPTCHA designers and attackers, and possible future directions for producing more reliable human/computer distinguishers.", "citation": "Citations (263)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Elie Bursztein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bursztein:Elie", "Matthieu Martin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martin:Matthieu", "John C.
