{"title": "Multi-label learning with incomplete class assignments.", "fields": ["ranking", "semi supervised learning", "labeled data", "ambiguity", "lasso"], "abstract": "We consider a special type of multi-label learning where class assignments of training examples are incomplete. As an example, an instance whose true class assignment is (c 1 , c 2 , c 3 ) is only assigned to class c 1  when it is used as a training sample. We refer to this problem as multi-label learning with incomplete class assignment. Incompletely labeled data is frequently encountered when the number of classes is very large (hundreds as in MIR Flickr dataset) or when there is a large ambiguity between classes (e.g., jet vs plane). In both cases, it is difficult for users to provide complete class assignments for objects. We propose a ranking based multi-label learning framework that explicitly addresses the challenge of learning from incompletely labeled data by exploiting the group lasso technique to combine the ranking errors. We present a learning algorithm that is empirically shown to be efficient for solving the related optimization problem. Our empirical study shows that the proposed framework is more effective than the state-of-the-art algorithms for multi-label learning in dealing with incompletely labeled data.", "citation": "Citations (105)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Serhat Selcuk Bucak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bucak:Serhat_Selcuk", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong", "Anil K.
