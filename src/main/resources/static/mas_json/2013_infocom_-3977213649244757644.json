In this paper, we focus on power market models in which prosumers interact in a distributed environment during the purchase or sale of electric power. We have chosen to follow the distributed power market model DEZENT. Our contribution is the planning phase of the consumption of prosumers based on the negotiation mechanism of DEZENT. We propose a controller for the planning of the consumption which aims at minimizing the electricity cost achieved at the end of a day. In the paper we discuss the assumptions on which the controller design is based.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Pisa", "IMT Institute for Advanced Studies Lucca"], "authors": ["Ugo Montanari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Montanari:Ugo", "Alain Tcheukam Siwe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siwe:Alain_Tcheukam"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 6}
