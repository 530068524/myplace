{"title": "Software change dynamics: evidence from 35 java projects.", "fields": ["real time computing", "theoretical computer science", "java", "programming language", "software"], "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the relationship between class dependency and change propagation in Java software. By analyzing 35 large Open Source Java projects, we find that in the majority of the projects more than half of the dependencies are never involved in change propagation. Furthermore, our analysis shows that only a few dependencies are transmitting the majority of change propagation events. An additional analysis reveals that this concentration cannot be explained by the different ages of the dependencies. The conclusion is that the dependency structure alone is a poor measure for the change dynamics. This contrasts with current literature.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Markus M.
