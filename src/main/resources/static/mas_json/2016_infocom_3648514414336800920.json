{"title": "NetCodCCN: A network coding approach for content-centric networks.", "fields": ["interest aggregation", "linear network coding", "network delay", "intelligent computer network", "network simulation"], "abstract": "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) naturally supports multi-path communication, as it allows the simultaneous use of multiple interfaces (e.g. LTE and WiFi). When multiple sources and multiple clients are considered, the optimal set of distribution trees should be determined in order to optimally use all the available interfaces. This is not a trivial task, as it is a computationally intense procedure that should be done centrally. The need for central coordination can be removed by employing network coding, which also offers improved resiliency to errors and large throughput gains. In this paper, we propose NetCodCCN, a protocol for integrating network coding in CCN. In comparison to previous works proposing to enable network coding in CCN, NetCodCCN permits Interest aggregation and Interest pipelining, which reduce the data retrieval times. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed protocol leads to significant improvements in terms of content retrieval delay compared to the original CCN. Our results demonstrate that the use of network coding adds robustness to losses and permits to exploit more efficiently the available network resources. The performance gains are verified for content retrieval in various network scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Bern", "University of Bern", "University of Essex", "University of Bern"], "authors": ["Jonnahtan Saltarin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saltarin:Jonnahtan", "Eirina Bourtsoulatze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bourtsoulatze:Eirina", "Nikolaos Thomos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomos:Nikolaos", "Torsten Braun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braun:Torsten"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
