We present a general template of MCTS algorithms for these games, which can be instantiated by various selection methods. We formally prove that if a selection method is e-Hannan consistent in a matrix game and satisfies additional requirements on exploration, then the MCTS algorithm eventually converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE) of the extensive-form game. We empirically evaluate this claim using regret matching and Exp3 as the selection methods on randomly generated games and empirically selected worst case games. We confirm the formal result and show that additional MCTS variants also converge to approximate NE on the evaluated games.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague", "Maastricht University", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "authors": ["Viliam Lis\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lis=yacute=:Viliam", "Vojtech Kovar\u00edk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kovar=iacute=k:Vojtech", "Marc Lanctot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lanctot:Marc", "Branislav Bosansk\u00fd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bosansk=yacute=:Branislav"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
