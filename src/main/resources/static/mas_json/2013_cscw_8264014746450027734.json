Yet the data sets they collect do not unproblematically model or mirror the world events. In this paper we use data from Foursquare, a popular location check-in service, to argue for the importance of analysing social media as a communicative rather than representational system. Drawing on logs of all Foursquare check-ins over eight weeks we highlight four features of Foursquare's use: the relationship between attendance and check-ins, event check-ins, commercial incentives to check-in, and lastly humorous check-ins These points show how large data analysis is affected by the end user uses to which social networks are put.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Stockholm University", "Yahoo!", "Mobile Life @ S ... ockholm, Sweden", "Mobile Life @ D ... ockholm, Sweden"], "authors": ["Mattias Rost.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rost:Mattias", "Louise Barkhuus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barkhuus:Louise", "Henriette Cramer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cramer:Henriette", "Barry A.
