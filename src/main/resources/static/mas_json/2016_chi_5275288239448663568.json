Participants performed a one-dimensional targeting task as described by the ISO 9421-9 standard. In the experiment, we compared two methods of bend input: position control and rate control of a cursor. Participants performed the task with three levels of device stiffness. Results show that bend input is highly correlated with Fitts' law for both position and rate control. Position control produced significantly higher throughput values than rate control. Our experiment also revealed that, when the amount of force applied was controlled, device stiffness did not have a significant effect on performance.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Queen's University", "Queen's University", "Queen's University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jesse Burstyn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burstyn:Jesse", "Juan Pablo Carrascal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carrascal:Juan_Pablo", "Roel Vertegaal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vertegaal:Roel"], "pages": 10}
