{"title": "MED: A Multimedia Event Database for 3D Crime Scene Representation and Analysis.", "fields": ["data modeling", "scene statistics", "solid modeling", "crime scene", "multimedia database"], "abstract": "The development of sensors capable of obtaining 3D scans of crime scenes is revolutionizing the ways in which crime scenes can be analyzed and at the same time is driving the need for the development of sophisticated tools to represent and store this data. Here we describe the design of a multimedia database suitable for representing and reasoning about crime scene data. The representation is grounded in the physical environment that makes up the crime scene and provides mechanisms for representing both traditional (forms-based) data as well as 3D scan and other complex spatial data.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["York University", "York University", "York University", "York University", "York University"], "authors": ["Marcin Kwietniewski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwietniewski:Marcin", "Stephanie Wilson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilson:Stephanie", "Anna Topol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Topol:Anna", "Sunbir Gill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gill:Sunbir", "Jarek Gryz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gryz:Jarek", "Michael Jenkin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jenkin:Michael", "Piotr Jasiobedzki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jasiobedzki:Piotr", "Ho-Kong Ng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ng:Ho=Kong"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
