One promising approach to solving this problem is to use hints from the storage clients to manage the storage server cache. Previous hinting approaches are ad hoc, in that a predefined reaction to specific types of hints is hard-coded into the caching policy. With ad hoc approaches, it is difficult to ensure that the best hints are being used, and it is difficult to accommodate multiple types of hints and multiple client applications. In this paper, we propose CLient-Informed Caching (CLIC), a generic hint-based policy for managing storage server caches. CLIC automatically interprets hints generated by storage clients and translates them into a server caching policy. It does this without explicit knowledge of the application-specific hint semantics. We demonstrate using trace-based simulation of database workloads that CLIC outperforms hint-oblivious and state-of-the-art hint-aware caching policies. We also demonstrate that the space required to track and interpret hints is small.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Xin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0017:Xin", "Ashraf Aboulnaga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aboulnaga:Ashraf", "Kenneth Salem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salem:Kenneth", "Xuhui Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xuhui"], "conf": "fast", "year": "2009", "pages": 14}
