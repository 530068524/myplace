It considers the impact of obstacles on the distance between objects, which is ignored by most of spatial queries. Given a data set  P , an obstacle set  O , and a query line segment  q  in a two-dimensional space, a CONN query retrieves the nearest neighbor of each point on q according to the  obstructed distance , i.e., the  shortest path  between them without crossing any obstacle. We formulate CONN search, analyze its unique properties, and develop algorithms for  exact  CONN query processing, assuming that both  P  and  O  are indexed by conventional data-partitioning indices (e.g., R-trees). Our methods tackle the CONN retrieval by performing a  single  query for the  entire  query segment, and only process the data points and obstacles  relevant to the final result , via a novel concept of  control points  and an efficient  quadratic-based split point computation algorithm . In addition, we extend our solution to handle the  continuous obstructed k-nearest neighbor  (CO k NN) search, which finds the  k  (\u22651)nearest neighbors to every point along  q  based on obstructed distances. A comprehensive experimental evaluation using both real and synthetic datasets has been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (80)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Yunjun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yunjun", "Baihua Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Baihua"], "pages": 14}
