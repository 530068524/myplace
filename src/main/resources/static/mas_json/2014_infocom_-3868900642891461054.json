Specifically, we consider the joint optimization of network resource allocation and video quality adaptation. Our objective is to fairly maximize video clients' Quality of Experience (QoE) re- alizing tradeoffs among the mean quality, temporal variability in quality, and fairness, incorporating user preferences on rebuffer- ing and cost of video delivery. We present a simple asymptotically optimal online algorithm, NOVA, to solve the problem. NOVA is asynchronous, and using minimal communication, distributes the tasks of resource allocation to network controller, and quality adaptation to respective video clients. Video quality adaptation in NOVA is also optimal for standalone video clients, and is well suited for use in the DASH framework. Further, NOVA can be extended for use with more general QoE models, networks shared with other traffic loads and networks using fixed/legacy resource allocation.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Vinay Joseph.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joseph:Vinay", "Gustavo de Veciana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veciana:Gustavo_de"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2014", "pages": 9}
