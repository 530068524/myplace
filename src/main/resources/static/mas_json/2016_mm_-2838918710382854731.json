{"title": "Placing Broadcast News Videos in their Social Media Context Using Hashtags.", "fields": ["ideology", "news media", "media relations", "social media optimization", "modalities"], "abstract": "With the growth of social media platforms in recent years, social media is now a major source of information and news for many people around the world. In particular the rise of hashtags have helped to build communities of discussion around particular news, topics, opinions, and ideologies. However, television news programs still provide value and are used by a vast majority of the population to obtain their news, but these videos are not easily linked to broader discussion on social media. We have built a novel pipeline that allows television news to be placed in its relevant social media context, by leveraging hashtags. In this paper, we present a method for automatically collecting television news and social media content (Twitter) and discovering the hashtags that are relevant for a TV news video. Our algorithms incorporate both the visual and text information within social media and television content, and we show that by leveraging both modalities we can improve performance over single modality approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Joseph G.
