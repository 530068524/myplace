However, due to its spontaneous nature and the limitations of paper, it is difficult to distill and communicate a paper prototype design and its user test findings to a wide audience. To address these issues, we created FrameWire, a computer vision-based system that automatically extracts interaction flows from the video recording of paper prototype user tests. Based on the extracted logic, FrameWire offers two distinct benefits for designers: a structural view of the video recording that allows a designer or a stakeholder to easily distill and understand the design concept and user interaction behaviors, and automatic generation of interactive HTML-based prototypes that can be easily tested with a larger group of users as well as \"walked through\" by other stakeholders. The extraction is achieved by automatically aggregating video frame sequences into an interaction flow graph based on frame similarities and a designer-guided clustering process. The results of evaluating FrameWire with realistic paper prototyping tests show that our extraction approach is feasible and FrameWire is a promising tool for enhancing existing prototyping practice.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Microsoft", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Yang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yang", "Xiang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xiang", "Katherine Everitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Everitt:Katherine", "Morgan Dixon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dixon:Morgan", "James A.
