We present a feasibility study investigating if and how gestures made with your finger can be used to create such objects. A revised interface design is evaluated in a user study with 24 subjects that reveals a high usability and entertainment value, but also identifies issues such as ergonomic discomfort and imprecise input for complex tasks. Hence, our results suggest huge potential for this type of interaction in the entertainment, edutainment, and leisure domain, but limited usefulness for serious applications.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Utrecht University", "Utrecht University"], "authors": ["Wolfgang H\u00fcrst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=uuml=rst:Wolfgang", "Joris Dekker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dekker:Joris"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
