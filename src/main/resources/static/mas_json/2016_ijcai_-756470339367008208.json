In the machine learning community, crowdsourcing is commonly used as a cost-saving way to collect labels for training data. While a lot of effort has been spent on developing methods for inferring labels from a crowd, few work concentrates on the theoretical foundation of crowdsourcing learning. In this paper, we theoretically study the cost-saving effect of crowdsourcing learning, and present an upper bound for the minimally-sufficient number of crowd labels for effective crowdsourcing learning. Our results provide an understanding about how to allocate crowd labels efficiently, and are verified empirically.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Nanjing University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Lu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lu", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "pages": 7}
