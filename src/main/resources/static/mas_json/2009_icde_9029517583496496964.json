In this paper, we focus on language and runtime support for improving the performance of sense-and-respond applications in processing data from high rate streams. The central tenet of this work is the definition of a streaming architectural pattern for these application domains and the programming model and the code generation framework to support it. Using IBM Research's System S middleware and the SPADE language, we demonstrate how to scale up a financial trading application.", "citation": "Citations (40)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "University of Illinois at Chicago"], "authors": ["Henrique Andrade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andrade:Henrique", "Bugra Gedik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gedik:Bugra", "Kun-Lung Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Kun=Lung", "Philip S.
