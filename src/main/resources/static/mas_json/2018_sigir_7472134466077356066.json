Unfortunately, because of language barrier, some scientists (especially the junior ones or graduate students who do not master other languages) cannot efficiently locate the publications hosted in a foreign language repository. In this study, we propose a novel solution, cross-language citation recommendation via Hierarchical Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Graph (HRLHG), to address this new problem. HRLHG can learn a representation function by mapping the publications, from multilingual repositories, to a low-dimensional joint embedding space from various kinds of vertexes and relations on a heterogeneous graph. By leveraging both global (task specific) plus local (task independent) information as well as a novel supervised hierarchical random walk algorithm, the proposed method can optimize the publication representations by maximizing the likelihood of locating the important cross-language neighborhoods on the graph. Experiment results show that the proposed method can not only outperform state-of-the-art baseline models, but also improve the interpretability of the representation model for cross-language citation recommendation task.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Beijing Normal University", "Peking University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Alibaba Group"], "authors": ["Zhuoren Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Zhuoren", "Yue Yin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yin:Yue", "Liangcai Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Liangcai", "Yao Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yao", "Xiaozhong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xiaozhong"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
