We advocate learning a generic vehicle motion model from large scale crowd-sourced video data, and develop an end-to-end trainable architecture for learning to predict a distribution over future vehicle egomotion from instantaneous monocular camera observations and previous vehicle state. Our model incorporates a novel FCN-LSTM architecture, which can be learned from large-scale crowd-sourced vehicle action data, and leverages available scene segmentation side tasks to improve performance under a privileged learning paradigm. We provide a novel large-scale dataset of crowd-sourced driving behavior suitable for training our model, and report results predicting the driver action on held out sequences across diverse conditions.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Huazhe Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huazhe", "Yang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Yang", "Fisher Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Fisher", "Trevor Darrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Darrell:Trevor"], "pages": 9}
