{"title": "Information Leaks Without Memory Disclosures: Remote Side Channel Attacks on Diversified Code.", "fields": ["address space layout randomization", "code injection", "side channel attack", "memory corruption", "code reuse"], "abstract": "Code diversification has been proposed as a technique to mitigate code reuse attacks, which have recently become the predominant way for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities. As code reuse attacks require detailed knowledge of where code is in memory, diversification techniques attempt to mitigate these attacks by randomizing what instructions are executed and where code is located in memory. As an attacker cannot read the diversified code, it is assumed he cannot reliably exploit the code.   In this paper, we show that the fundamental assumption behind code diversity can be broken, as executing the code reveals information about the code. Thus, we can leak information without needing to read the code. We demonstrate how an attacker can utilize a memory corruption vulnerability to create side channels that leak information in novel ways, removing the need for a memory disclosure vulnerability. We introduce seven new classes of attacks that involve fault analysis and timing side channels, where each allows a remote attacker to learn how code has been diversified.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Jeff Seibert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seibert:Jeff", "Hamed Okkhravi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Okkhravi:Hamed", "Eric S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=ouml=derstr=ouml=m:Eric"], "pages": 12}
