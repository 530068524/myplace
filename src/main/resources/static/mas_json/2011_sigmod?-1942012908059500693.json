{"title": "Nova: continuous Pig/Hadoop workflows.", "fields": ["dataflow", "stateful firewall", "workflow", "data stream", "low latency"], "abstract": "This paper describes a workflow manager developed and deployed at Yahoo called Nova, which pushes continually-arriving data through graphs of Pig programs executing on Hadoop clusters. (Pig is a structured dataflow language and runtime for the Hadoop map-reduce system.)   Nova is like data stream managers in its support for stateful incremental processing, but unlike them in that it deals with data in large batches using disk-based processing. Batched incremental processing is a good fit for a large fraction of Yahoo's data processing use-cases, which deal with continually-arriving data and benefit from incremental algorithms, but do not require ultra-low-latency processing.", "citation": "Citations (145)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Christopher Olston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olston:Christopher", "Greg Chiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiou:Greg", "Laukik Chitnis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chitnis:Laukik", "Francis Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Francis", "Yiping Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Yiping", "Mattias Larsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsson:Mattias", "Andreas Neumann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neumann_0001:Andreas", "Vellanki B.
