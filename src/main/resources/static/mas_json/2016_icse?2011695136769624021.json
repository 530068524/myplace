{"title": "The sky is not the limit: multitasking across GitHub projects.", "fields": ["software development", "software", "distraction", "incentive", "human multitasking"], "abstract": "Software development has always inherently required multitasking: developers switch between coding, reviewing, testing, designing, and meeting with colleagues. The advent of software ecosystems like GitHub has enabled something new: the ability to easily switch  between  projects. Developers also have social incentives to contribute to many projects; prolific contributors gain social recognition and (eventually) economic rewards. Multitasking, however, comes at a cognitive cost: frequent context-switches can lead to distraction, sub-standard work, and even greater stress. In this paper, we gather ecosystem-level data on a group of programmers working on a large collection of projects. We develop models and methods for measuring the rate and breadth of a developers' context-switching behavior, and we study how context-switching affects their productivity. We also survey developers to understand the reasons for and perceptions of multitasking. We find that the most common reason for multitasking is interrelationships and dependencies between projects. Notably, we find that the  rate of switching  and  breadth  (number of projects) of a developer's work matter. Developers who work on many projects have higher productivity if they focus on few projects per day. Developers that switch projects too much during the course of a day have  lower  productivity as they work on more projects overall. Despite these findings, developers perceptions of the benefits of multitasking are varied.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of Auckland", "Zhejiang University of Technology", "University of California, Davis", "University of Victoria"], "authors": ["Bogdan Vasilescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasilescu:Bogdan", "Kelly Blincoe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blincoe:Kelly", "Qi Xuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xuan:Qi", "Casey Casalnuovo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casalnuovo:Casey", "Daniela E.
