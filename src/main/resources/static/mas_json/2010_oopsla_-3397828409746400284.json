A closer look into the underlying research methods reveals a distressing characteristic of programming language research: developers, which are the main audience for new language constructs, are hardly considered in the research process. As a consequence, it is simply not possible to state whether a new construct that requires some kind of interaction with the developer has any positive impact on the construction of software. This paper argues for appropriate research methods in programming language research that rely on studies of developers -- and argues that the introduction of corresponding empirical methods not only requires a new understanding of research but also a different view on how to teach software science to students.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["University of Duisburg-Essen"], "authors": ["Stefan Hanenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hanenberg:Stefan"], "conf": "oopsla", "year": "2010", "pages": 14}
