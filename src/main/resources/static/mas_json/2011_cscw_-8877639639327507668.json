{"title": "Look ma, no email!: blogs and IRC as primary and preferred communication tools in a distributed firm.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "computer supported cooperative work", "virtual team", "knowledge management", "knowledge sharing"], "abstract": "Email has been the primary communication medium in organizations for decades and despite studies that demonstrate its obvious disadvantages, the prevailing thinking is that email is irreplaceable. In this paper I challenge that view through a field study of a distributed firm that is highly successful in developing and delivering products without regular use of email in the workplace. Group blogging and IRC were the primary tools used and they allowed improved coordination and knowledge sharing compared to email. This paper contributes to scant literature in CSCW on firm-level technology use.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech"], "authors": ["Aditya Johri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johri:Aditya"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
