{"title": "Lessons from thoughtswap-ing: increasing participants' coordinative agency in facilitated discussions.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "knowledge management", "computer supported cooperative work", "computer science"], "abstract": "A successful collaborative tool designed to aid discussion must be flexible, maintain the user's coordinative agency, and be appropriable in many contexts. We have developed a tool, called ThoughtSwap, to help widen and deepen the scope of participation in facilitated discussions while supporting, not supplanting, discussants' coordination. By driving the design of ThoughtSwap toward a simpler mechanism, we were able to create a more versatile, high-impact tool. We design for an educational setting, but see wider possible use.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "Virginia Tech", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "authors": ["Margaret Dickey-Kurdziolek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dickey=Kurdziolek:Margaret", "Matthew Schaefer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaefer:Matthew", "Deborah G.
