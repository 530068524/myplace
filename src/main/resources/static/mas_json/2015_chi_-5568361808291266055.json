We present a novel approach for real-time collaborative editing of geo-data. We introduce Ethermap, an open source web-application that implements this approach and enables multiple users to map data concurrently. It supports synchronous and collaborative mapping in several ways: it visually highlights mapping activities, it allows for fine-grained reviewing of all changes, and it enhances text-based communication with cross-modal references to geo-objects. We report on key results from a multi-tiered evaluation of Ethermap based on a user-study and on expert interviews. The concept of real-time collaborative editing was received favorably by users and experts. Participants of the study learned to use Ethermap quickly, and successfully completed a collaborative mapping task. Experts and users agreed that, given the right scenario (e.g., disaster mapping, teaching, planning), the approach could benefit the process of working on geo-data collaboratively.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of M\u00fcnster", "University of M\u00fcnster", "University of M\u00fcnster"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Thore Fechner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fechner:Thore", "Dennis Wilhelm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilhelm:Dennis", "Christian Kray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kray:Christian"], "pages": 10}
