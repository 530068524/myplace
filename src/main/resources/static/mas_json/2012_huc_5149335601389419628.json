We show that because of the special characteristics of the AP such as: being the last node at the edge of the network, no power constraint, and powerful computing capabilities, it can be the best candidate for context-aware content adaptation in high dynamic wireless mobile networks. In fact, it can adapt content more accurately and faster in a high diverse and dynamic context. Content adaptation at the application and MAC layers of the  AP  is introduced in this paper.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Old Dominion University", "Old Dominion University", "Old Dominion University"], "authors": ["Shahram Mohrehkesh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mohrehkesh:Shahram", "Tamer Nadeem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nadeem:Tamer", "Michele C.
