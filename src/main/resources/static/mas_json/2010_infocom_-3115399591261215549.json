To study the physical-layer characteristics of OSMR, we implement a prototype OSMR transmitter/receiver with GNU software defined radio and conduct experiments in a university building. Our results are positive and show that wireless channels allow OSMR for a significant percentage of the time. Motivated by our physical-layer study, we propose extensions to the 802.11 MAC protocol to support OSMR transmission, which is backward-compatible with existing 802.11 devices. We also note that the access point (AP) needs a packet scheduling algorithm to efficiently exploit OSMR. We show that the scheduling problem without considering the packet transmission overhead can be formalized as a linear programming problem, but the scheduling problem considering the overhead is NP-hard. We then propose a practical scheduler based on a two-phase algorithm that can also handle channel fluctuations. We test the proposed protocol and algorithm with simulations driven by traffic traces collected from wireless LANs and channel-state traces collected from our experiments, and the results show that OSMR significantly improves the downlink performance.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University"], "authors": ["Zhenghao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zhenghao", "Steven Bronson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bronson:Steven", "Jin Xie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xie:Jin", "Hu Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Hu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
