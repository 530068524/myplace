BCIs have the potential to enhance the quality of life of people who are severely disabled, but it is often time-consuming to test and develop the systems. Simulation of BCI characteristics allows developers to rapidly test design options, and gain both subjective and quantitative insight into expected behaviour without using an EEG cap. A further motivation for the use of simulation is that 'impairing' a person without motor disabilities in a game with a disabled BCI user can create a level playing field and help carers empathise with BCI users. We demonstrate a use of the simulator in controlling a game of Brain Pong.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "University of Glasgow", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Melissa Quek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quek:Melissa", "Daniel Boland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Boland:Daniel", "John Williamson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williamson:John", "Roderick Murray-Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murray=Smith:Roderick", "Michele Tavella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tavella:Michele", "Serafeim Perdikis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perdikis:Serafeim", "Martijn Schreuder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schreuder:Martijn", "Michael Tangermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tangermann:Michael"], "pages": 4}
