For FO-sentences, the algorithm has 5-fold (4-fold) exponential time complexity. This is complemented by lower bounds showing that for FO-sentences a 3-fold exponential blow-up of the computed existential (existential-positive) sentence is unavoidable.   Furthermore, we show that for an input FO-formula, a C  d  -equivalent Feferman-Vaught decomposition can be computed in 3-fold exponential time. We also provide a matching lower bound.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Goethe University Frankfurt", "Goethe University Frankfurt", "Goethe University Frankfurt"], "authors": ["Frederik Harwath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harwath:Frederik", "Lucas Heimberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heimberg:Lucas", "Nicole Schweikardt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schweikardt:Nicole"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
