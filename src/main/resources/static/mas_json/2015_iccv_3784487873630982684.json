The first step consists of estimating the camera pose, given a Structure from Motion (SfM) model, up to the translation along the optical axis. As a second step, we obtain the calibration by finding the translation of the camera center using an ordering constraint. The method makes use of the 1D radial camera model, which allows us to effectively handle any radially symmetric camera, including non-central ones. Using this ordering constraint, we show that the we are able to calibrate several different (central and non-central) Wide Field of View (WFOV) cameras, including fisheye, hyper-catadioptric and spherical catadioptric cameras, as well as pinhole cameras, using a single image or jointly solving for several views.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Dept. of Comput ... ch, Switzerland", "Dept. of Comput ... ch, Switzerland", "Dept. of Comput ... ch, Switzerland"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Federico Camposeco.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camposeco:Federico", "Torsten Sattler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sattler:Torsten", "Marc Pollefeys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pollefeys:Marc"], "pages": 9}
