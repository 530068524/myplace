Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) exploits Hamiltonian dynamics to construct efficient proposals for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paper, we present a generalization of HMC which exploits non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics. We refer to this algorithm as magnetic HMC, since in 3 dimensions a subset of the dynamics map onto the mechanics of a charged particle coupled to a magnetic field. We establish a theoretical basis for the use of non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics in MCMC, and construct a symplectic, leapfrog-like integrator allowing for the implementation of magnetic HMC. Finally, we exhibit several examples where these non-canonical dynamics can lead to improved mixing of magnetic HMC relative to ordinary HMC.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Nilesh Tripuraneni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tripuraneni:Nilesh", "Mark Rowland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rowland:Mark", "Zoubin Ghahramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghahramani:Zoubin", "Richard E.
