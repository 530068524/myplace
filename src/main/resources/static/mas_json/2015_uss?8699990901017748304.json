{"title": "Trends and Lessons from Three Years Fighting Malicious Extensions.", "fields": ["email spam", "malware", "internet privacy", "computer security", "web traffic"], "abstract": "In this work we expose wide-spread efforts by criminals to abuse the Chrome Web Store as a platform for distributing malicious extensions. A central component of our study is the design and implementation of WebEval, the first system that broadly identifies malicious extensions with a concrete, measurable detection rate of 96.5%. Over the last three years we detected 9,523 malicious extensions: nearly 10% of every extension submitted to the store. Despite a short window of operation--we removed 50% of malware within 25 minutes of creation--a handful of under 100 extensions escaped immediate detection and infected over 50 million Chrome users. Our results highlight that the extension abuse ecosystem is drastically different from malicious binaries: miscreants profit from web traffic and user tracking rather than email spam or banking theft.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "uss", "authors": ["Nav Jagpal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jagpal:Nav", "Eric Dingle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dingle:Eric", "Jean-Philippe Gravel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gravel:Jean=Philippe", "Panayiotis Mavrommatis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mavrommatis:Panayiotis", "Niels Provos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Provos:Niels", "Moheeb Abu Rajab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajab:Moheeb_Abu", "Kurt Thomas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thomas:Kurt"], "pages": 15}
