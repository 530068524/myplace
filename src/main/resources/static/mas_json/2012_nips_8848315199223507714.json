Here we provide an in depth analysis of this simple yet rich model. We show that such a GMM model is able to compete with even the most successful models of natural images in log likelihood scores, denoising performance and sample quality. We provide an analysis of what such a model learns from natural images as a function of number of mixture components \u2014 including covariance structure, contrast variation and intricate structures such as textures, boundaries and more. Finally, we show that the salient properties of the GMM learned from natural images can be derived from a simplified Dead Leaves model which explicitly models occlusion, explaining its surprising success relative to other models.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "departments": ["Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Computation", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Daniel Zoran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zoran:Daniel", "Yair Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:Yair"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
