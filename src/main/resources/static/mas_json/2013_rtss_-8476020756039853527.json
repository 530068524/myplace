{"title": "Monitoring of Workload Arrival Functions for Mixed-Criticality Systems.", "fields": ["certification", "workload", "mixed criticality", "system monitoring", "admission control"], "abstract": "Integrating applications with different safety requirements on a common platform requires either certification of all applications to the highest safety level or \"sufficient independence\" among them. As the former typically is too costly, isolation mechanisms, such as monitoring, are key in the design of mixed-criticality systems. We regard monitoring of activation patterns of real-time applications in mixed-criticality systems. Existing solutions monitor single tasks in isolation. We present a monitoring scheme which allows to monitor groups of tasks jointly. It allows to express correlations between activations and provides improved resource utilization as no isolation between tasks in a group is enforced.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Inst. fur Daten ... chweig, Germany", "Inst. fur Daten ... chweig, Germany", "Inst. fur Daten ... chweig, Germany", "Inst. fur Daten ... chweig, Germany"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Moritz Neukirchner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neukirchner:Moritz", "Philip Axer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Axer:Philip", "Tobias Michaels.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Michaels:Tobias", "Rolf Ernst.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ernst:Rolf"], "pages": 9}
