{"title": "Region categorization with mobile applications.", "fields": ["template matching", "categorization", "visual search", "feature detection", "histogram of oriented gradients"], "abstract": "We explore how to optimally categorize regions for faster and more reliable image matching and registration. We propose using the entropy of histogram of oriented gradients(HOG) features to characterize image regions, and propose a region-sensitive feature selection algorithm for image registration. We apply the region categorization algorithms to several mobile applications, including mobile visual search and image registration for panorama. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by experimental results on a large dataset.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Nokia"], "authors": ["Jiang Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jiang"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
