{"title": "Towards nominal computation.", "fields": ["lambda calculus", "modulo", "finite set", "formalism", "set theory"], "abstract": "Nominal sets are a different kind of set theory, with a more relaxed notion of finiteness. They offer an elegant formalism for describing lambda-terms modulo alpha-conversion, or automata on data words. This paper is an attempt at defining computation in nominal sets. We present a rudimentary programming language, called Nlambda. The key idea is that it includes a native type for finite sets in the nominal sense. To illustrate the power of our language, we write short programs that process automata on data words.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Mikolaj Bojanczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bojanczyk:Mikolaj", "Laurent Braud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braud:Laurent", "Bartek Klin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klin:Bartek", "Slawomir Lasota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lasota:Slawomir"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2012", "pages": 12}
