{"title": "(Hierarchical) Identity-Based Encryption from Affine Message Authentication.", "fields": ["prime", "encryption", "pairing", "message authentication code", "affine transformation"], "abstract": "We provide a generic transformation from any affine message authentication code (MAC) to an identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme over pairing groups of prime order. If the MAC satisfies a security notion related to unforgeability against chosen-message attacks and, for example, the k-Linear assumption holds, then the resulting IBE scheme is adaptively secure. Our security reduction is tightness preserving, i.e., if the MAC has a tight security reduction so has the IBE scheme. Furthermore, the transformation also extends to hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE). We also show how to construct affine MACs with a tight security reduction to standard assumptions. This, among other things, provides the first tightly secure HIBE in the standard model.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "departments": ["Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum", "Ruhr University Bochum"], "authors": ["Olivier Blazy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blazy:Olivier", "Eike Kiltz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiltz:Eike", "Jiaxin Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Jiaxin"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2014", "pages": 18}
