{"title": "KASANDR: A Large-Scale Dataset with Implicit Feedback for Recommendation.", "fields": ["recommender system", "data mining", "computer science", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a novel, publicly available collection for recommendation systems that records the behavior of customers of the European leader in eCommerce advertising, Kelkoo\\footnote{\\url{https://www.kelkoo.com/}}, during one month. This dataset gathers implicit feedback, in form of clicks, of users that have interacted with over 56 million offers displayed by Kelkoo, along with a rich set of contextual features regarding both customers and offers. In conjunction with a detailed description of the dataset, we show the performance of six state-of-the-art recommender models and raise some questions on how to encompass the existing contextual information in the system.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Grenoble", "University of Grenoble", "University of Grenoble", "Kelkoo, Grenoble, France", "Kelkoo, Grenoble, France"], "authors": ["Sumit Sidana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sidana:Sumit", "Charlotte Laclau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Laclau:Charlotte", "Massih-Reza Amini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amini:Massih=Reza", "Gilles Vandelle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vandelle:Gilles", "Andr\u00e9 Bois-Crettez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bois=Crettez:Andr=eacute="], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
