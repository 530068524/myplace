{"title": "Using Fingerprint Authentication to Reduce System Security: An Empirical Study.", "fields": ["password policy", "password", "one time password", "enterprise information security architecture", "multi factor authentication"], "abstract": "Choosing the security architecture and policies for a system is a demanding task that must be informed by an understanding of user behavior. We investigate the hypothesis that adding visible security features to a system increases user confidence in the security of a system and thereby causes users to reduce how much effort they spend in other security areas. In our study, 96 volunteers each created a pair of accounts, one secured only by a password and one secured by both a password and a fingerprint reader. Our results strongly support our hypothesis -- on average. When using the fingerprint reader, users created passwords that would take one three-thousandth as long to break, thereby potentially negating the advantage two-factor authentication could have offered.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["Dept. of Comput ... ocorro, NM, USA", "Dept. of Comput ... ocorro, NM, USA"], "authors": ["Hugh Wimberly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wimberly:Hugh", "Lorie M.
