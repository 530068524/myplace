FlexiTaint is implemented as an in-order addition to the back-end of the processor pipeline, and the taints for memory locations are stored as a packed array in regular memory. The taint propagation scheme is specified via a software handler that, given the operation and the sourcespsila taints, computes the new taint for the result. To keep performance overheads low, FlexiTaint caches recent taint propagation lookups and uses a filter to avoid lookups for simple common-case behavior. We also describe how to implement consistent taint propagation in a multi-core environment. Our experiments show that FlexiTaint incurs average performance overheads of only 1% for SPEC2000 benchmarks and 3.7% for Splash-2 benchmarks, even when simultaneously following two different taint propagation policies.", "citation": "Citations (169)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "North Carolina State University", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Guru Venkataramani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkataramani:Guru", "Ioannis Doudalis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doudalis:Ioannis", "Yan Solihin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Solihin:Yan", "Milos Prvulovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prvulovic:Milos"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2008", "pages": 12}
