Our strategies use theory and prior work to substantially extend a set of existing design goals. Our extensions specifically account for social characteristics and other tactics that should be supported by persuasive technologies that target long-term discretionary use throughout everyday life. We used these strategies to design and build a system that encourages people to lead a physically active lifestyle. Results from two field studies of the system - a three-week trial and a three-month experiment - have shown that the system was successful at helping people maintain a more physically active lifestyle and validate the usefulness of the strategies.", "citation": "Citations (537)", "departments": ["Intel", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Sunny Consolvo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Consolvo:Sunny", "David W.
