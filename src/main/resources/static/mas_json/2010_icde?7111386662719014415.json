{"title": "Navigating through Mashed-up Applications with COMPASS.", "fields": ["mashup", "web application", "server", "data security", "compass"], "abstract": "Mashups integrate a set of complementary Web-services and data sources, often referred to as mashlets. We consider here a common scenario where the integrated mashlets are part of larger Web-applications, and their integration yields a set of inter-connected applications. We refer to them as Mashed-up Applications (abbr. MashAPP). The inter-connections between the mashlets enrich the individual Web-applications, but at the same time make the user navigation within them more intricate as actions in one application may affect others. To address this difficulty, we present COMPASS, a system that assists users in their navigation through MashAPPs. The system employs a novel top-k algorithm to propose users the most effective navigation paths for their specified goals. The suggestions are continually adapted to choices taken by the users while navigating.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Daniel Deutch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deutch:Daniel", "Ohad Greenshpan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenshpan:Ohad", "Tova Milo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milo:Tova"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
