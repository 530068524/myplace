The SR image is estimated from a set of multiple hypotheses, which are sequentially reorganized by evaluating their consistency with the input image. The concepts of norm regularization and motion registration in single/multi-frame SR are mapped into stochastic processes of an SMC's proposal distribution. The experiments showed that our framework is capable of seamlessly restoring both static and moving regions of degraded pictures.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["NHK (Japan Broa ... a, Tokyo, Japan", "NHK (Japan Broa ... a, Tokyo, Japan", "NHK (Japan Broa ... a, Tokyo, Japan", "NHK (Japan Broa ... a, Tokyo, Japan"], "authors": ["Toshie Misu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Misu:Toshie", "Yasutaka Matsuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsuo:Yasutaka", "Shinichi Sakaida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakaida:Shinichi", "Yoshiaki Shishikui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shishikui:Yoshiaki"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
