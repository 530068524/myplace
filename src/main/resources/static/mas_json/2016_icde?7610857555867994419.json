{"title": "Input selection for fast feature engineering.", "fields": ["feature engineering", "feature model", "feature learning", "feature", "raw data"], "abstract": "The application of machine learning to large datasets has become a vital component of many important and sophisticated software systems built today. Such trained systems are often based on supervised learning tasks that require features, signals extracted from the data that distill complicated raw data objects into a small number of salient values. A trained system's success depends substantially on the quality of its features. Unfortunately, feature engineering\u2014the process of writing code that takes raw data objects as input and outputs feature vectors suitable for a machine learning algorithm\u2014is a tedious, time-consuming experience. Because \u201cbig data\u201d inputs are so diverse, feature engineering is often a trial-and-error process requiring many small, iterative code changes. Because the inputs are so large, each code change can involve a time-consuming data processing task (over each page in a Web crawl, for example). We introduce Zombie, a data-centric system that accelerates feature engineering through intelligent input selection, optimizing the \u201cinner loop\u201d of the feature engineering process. Our system yields feature evaluation speedups of up to 8\u00d7 in some cases and reduces engineer wait times from 8 to 5 hours in others.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Michael R.
