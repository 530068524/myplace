The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods. Adopting this approach opens the door for real world scene text recognition to benefit from the rapid advances that have been taking place in object recognition.", "citation": "Citations (541)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego", "University of California, San Diego"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Kai Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Kai", "Boris Babenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Babenko:Boris", "Serge J.
