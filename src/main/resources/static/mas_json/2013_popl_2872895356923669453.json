The algorithmic complexity and scalability limitations remain one important weakness. We address it using sub-polyhedral under-aproximations of the systems of constraints resulting from affine scheduling problems. We propose a sub-polyhedral scheduling technique using (Unit-)Two-Variable-Per-Inequality or (U)TVPI Polyhedra. This technique relies on simple polynomial time algorithms to under-approximate a general polyhedron into (U)TVPI polyhedra. We modify the state-of-the-art PLuTo compiler using our scheduling technique, and show that for a majority of the Polybench (2.0) kernels, the above under-approximations yield polyhedra that are non-empty. Solving the under-approximated system leads to asymptotic gains in complexity, and shows practically significant improvements when compared to a traditional LP solver. We also verify that code generated by our sub-polyhedral parallelization prototype matches the performance of PLuTo-optimized code when the under-approximation preserves feasibility.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Paris-Sud", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["Ramakrishna Upadrasta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Upadrasta:Ramakrishna", "Albert Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen_0001:Albert"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2013", "pages": 14}
