{"title": "Liability in software engineering: overview of the LISE approach and illustration on a case study.", "fields": ["liability", "formal methods", "systems engineering", "multidisciplinary approach", "software"], "abstract": "LISE is a multidisciplinary project involving lawyers and computer scientists with the aim to put forward a set of methods and tools to (1) define software liability in a precise and unambiguous way and (2) establish such liability in case of incident. This paper provides an overview of the overall approach taken in the project based on a case study. The case study illustrates a situation where, in order to reduce legal uncertainties, the parties to a contract wish to include in the agreement specific clauses to define as precisely as possible the share of liabilities between them for the main types of failures of the system.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Sup\u00e9lec", "University of Grenoble", "University of Grenoble"], "authors": ["Daniel Le M\u00e9tayer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=eacute=tayer:Daniel_Le", "Manuel Maarek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maarek:Manuel", "Val\u00e9rie Viet Triem Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Val=eacute=rie_Viet_Triem", "Eduardo Mazza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazza:Eduardo", "Marie-Laure Potet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Potet:Marie=Laure", "Nicolas Craipeau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Craipeau:Nicolas", "St\u00e9phane Fr\u00e9not.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fr=eacute=not:St=eacute=phane", "Ronan Hardouin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hardouin:Ronan"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
