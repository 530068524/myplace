Our goal is to examine the effect of the human contact process on data delivery. We find that the contact occurrence distribution is highly uneven: contacts between a few node-pairs occur too frequently, leading to inadequate mixing in the network, while the majority of contacts are rare, and essential for connectivity. This distribution of contacts leads to a significant variation in performance over short time windows. We discover that the formation of a large clique core during the window is correlated with the fraction of data delivered, as well as the speed of delivery. We then show that the clustering co-efficient of the contact graph over a time window is a good predictor of performance during the window. Taken together, our findings suggest new directions for designing forwarding algorithms in ad-hoc or delay-tolerant networking schemes using humans as data mules.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["Nishanth Sastry.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sastry:Nishanth", "Karen R.
