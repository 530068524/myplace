{"title": "Clutching Is Not (Necessarily) the Enemy.", "fields": ["cursor", "touchpad", "laptop", "adversary", "target acquisition"], "abstract": "Clutching is usually assumed to be triggered by a lack of physical space and detrimental to pointing performance. We conduct a controlled experiment using a laptop trackpad where the effect of clutching on pointing performance is dissociated from the effects of control-to-display transfer functions. Participants performed a series of target acquisition tasks using typical cursor acceleration functions with and without clutching. All pointing tasks were feasible without clutching, but clutch-less movements were harder to perform, caused more errors, required more preparation time, and were not faster than clutch-enabled movements.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mathieu Nancel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nancel:Mathieu", "Daniel Vogel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogel_0001:Daniel", "Edward Lank.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lank:Edward"], "pages": 4}
