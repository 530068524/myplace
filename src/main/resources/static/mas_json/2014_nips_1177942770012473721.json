In contrast to previous matrix recovery work, we drop the assumption of a random sampling of entries in favor of a deterministic sampling of principal submatrices of the matrix. We develop a set of sufficient conditions for the recovery of a SPSD matrix from a set of its principal submatrices, present necessity results based on this set of conditions and develop an algorithm that can exactly recover a matrix when these conditions are met. The proposed algorithm is naturally generalized to the problem of noisy matrix recovery, and we provide a worst-case bound on reconstruction error for this scenario. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithm's utility on noiseless and noisy simulated datasets.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["William E.
