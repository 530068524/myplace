{"title": "A tale of two languages: strategic self-disclosure via language selection on facebook.", "fields": ["cognition", "exploit", "first language", "self disclosure", "language barrier"], "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the way in which international Facebook users who had recently moved to the United States used different languages to selectively self-disclose to their old (native-language) and new (English-speaking) social circles. We found significantly more intimate self-disclosure, covering a broader range of cognitive and emotional topics, in native-language status updates compared to updates in English. Self-disclosure was also more positive in English. These patterns support our hypotheses that users exploit language barriers to serve different self-presentational goals for different social circles and generate implications for SNS privacy control.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Dai Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Dai", "Tina Chou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chou:Tina", "Naomi Drucker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drucker:Naomi", "Adi Robertson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robertson:Adi", "William C.
