{"title": "SpikeAnts, a spiking neuron network modelling the emergence of organization in a complex system.", "fields": ["ant", "network architecture", "ant colony", "asynchronous communication", "ranging"], "abstract": "Many complex systems, ranging from neural cell assemblies to insect societies, involve and rely on some division of labor. How to enforce such a division in a decentralized and distributed way, is tackled in this paper, using a spiking neuron network architecture. Specifically, a spatio-temporal model called SpikeAnts is shown to enforce the emergence of synchronized activities in an ant colony. Each ant is modelled from two spiking neurons; the ant colony is a sparsely connected spiking neuron network. Each ant makes its decision (among foraging, sleeping and self-grooming) from the competition between its two neurons, after the signals received from its neighbor ants. Interestingly, three types of temporal patterns emerge in the ant colony: asynchronous, synchronous, and synchronous periodic foraging activities - similar to the actual behavior of some living ant colonies. A phase diagram of the emergent activity patterns with respect to two control parameters, respectively accounting for ant sociability and receptivity, is presented and discussed.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Sylvain Chevallier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chevallier:Sylvain", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Paugam-Moisy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paugam=Moisy:H=eacute=l=egrave=ne", "Mich\u00e8le Sebag.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebag:Mich=egrave=le"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
