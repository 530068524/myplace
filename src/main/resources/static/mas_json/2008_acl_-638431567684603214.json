A generative model of mention generation is used to guide mention resolution. Results on three relatively small collections indicate that the accuracy of this approach compares favorably to the best known techniques, and results on the full CMU Enron collection indicate that it scales well to larger collections.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Tamer Elsayed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elsayed:Tamer", "Douglas W.
