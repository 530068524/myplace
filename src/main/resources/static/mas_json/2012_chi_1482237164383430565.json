Such contextual information significantly enhances touch interaction in a broad range of applications, from conventional touchscreens to unique contexts and materials. For example, in our explorations we add touch and gesture sensitivity to the human body and liquids. We demonstrate the rich capabilities of  Touche  with five example setups from different application domains and conduct experimental studies that show gesture classification accuracies of 99% are achievable with our technology.", "citation": "Citations (237)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "Disney Research", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Munehiko Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Munehiko", "Ivan Poupyrev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poupyrev:Ivan", "Chris Harrison.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harrison:Chris"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
