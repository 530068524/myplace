We show that even when the medium is already occupied by some nodes, nodes with more antennas can transmit concurrently without harming the ongoing transmissions. Furthermore, such nodes can contend for the medium in a fully distributed way. Our testbed evaluation shows that even for a small network with three competing node pairs, the resulting system about doubles the average network throughput. It also maintains the random access nature of today's 802.11n networks.", "citation": "Citations (170)", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Kate Ching-Ju Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Kate_Ching=Ju", "Shyamnath Gollakota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollakota:Shyamnath", "Dina Katabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katabi:Dina"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
