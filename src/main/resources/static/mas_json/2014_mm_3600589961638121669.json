For this reason, several researchers devised stress detection systems based on physiological parameters. However, these systems require that obtrusive sensors are continuously carried by the user. In our paper, we propose an alternative approach providing evidence that daily stress can be reliably recognized based on behavioral metrics, derived from the user's mobile phone activity and from additional indicators, such as the weather conditions (data pertaining to transitory properties of the environment) and the personality traits (data concerning permanent dispositions of individuals). Our multifactorial statistical model, which is person-independent, obtains the accuracy score of 72.28% for a 2-class daily stress recognition problem. The model is efficient to implement for most of multimedia applications due to highly reduced low-dimensional feature space (32d). Moreover, we identify and discuss the indicators which have strong predictive power.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "departments": ["University of Trento", "fondazione bruno kessler", "fondazione bruno kessler", "fondazione bruno kessler", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Andrey Bogomolov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bogomolov:Andrey", "Bruno Lepri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepri:Bruno", "Michela Ferron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferron:Michela", "Fabio Pianesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pianesi:Fabio", "Alex Pentland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pentland:Alex"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
