{"title": "Search computing: multi-domain search on ranked data.", "fields": ["beam search", "exploratory search", "search analytics", "metasearch engine", "semantic search"], "abstract": "We demonstrate the Search Computing framework for multi-domain queries upon ranked data collected from Web sources. Search Computing answers to queries like \"Find a good Jazz concert close to a specified location, a good restaurant and a hotel at walking distance\" and fills the gap between generic and domain-specific search engines, by proposing new methods, techniques, interfaces, and tools for building search-based applications spanning multiple data services. The main enabling technology is an execution engine supporting methods for rank-join execution upon ranked data sources, abstracted and wrapped by means of a unifying service model. The demo walks through the interface for formulating multi-domain queries and follows the steps of the query engine that builds the result, with the help of run-time monitors that clearly explain the system's behavior. Once results are extracted, the demonstration shows several approaches for visualizing results and exploring the information space.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "Polytechnic University of Milan"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Alessandro Bozzon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bozzon:Alessandro", "Daniele Braga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Braga:Daniele", "Marco Brambilla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brambilla_0001:Marco", "Stefano Ceri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceri:Stefano", "Francesco Corcoglioniti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Corcoglioniti:Francesco", "Piero Fraternali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fraternali:Piero", "Salvatore Vadacca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vadacca:Salvatore"], "pages": 4}
