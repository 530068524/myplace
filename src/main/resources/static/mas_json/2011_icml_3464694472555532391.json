We provide a message-passing algorithm that directly computes the l1 regularized approximate MLE. Further, in the case of certain reweighted entropy approximations to the partition function, we show that surprisingly the l1 regularized approximate MLE estimator has a closed-form, so that we would no longer need to run through many iterations of approximate inference and message-passing. Lastly, we analyze this general class of estimators for graph structure recovery, or its sparsistency, and show that it is indeed sparsistent under certain conditions.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Eunho Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Eunho", "Pradeep Ravikumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ravikumar:Pradeep"], "pages": 8}
