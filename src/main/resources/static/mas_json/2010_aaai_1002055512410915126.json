{"title": "Private and Third-Party Randomization in Risk-Sensitive Equilibrium Concepts.", "fields": ["trembling hand perfect equilibrium", "epsilon equilibrium", "best response", "folk theorem", "correlated equilibrium"], "abstract": "We consider risk-sensitive generalizations of Nash and correlated equilibria in noncooperative games. We prove that, except for a class of degenerate games, unless a two-player game has a pure Nash equilibrium, it does not have a risk-sensitive Nash equilibrium. We also show that every game has a risk-sensitive correlated equilibrium. The striking contrast between these existence results is due to the different sources of randomization in Nash (private randomization) and correlated equilibria (third-party randomization).", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "Michael Kearns"], "authors": ["Mickey Brautbar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brautbar:Mickey", "Michael J.
