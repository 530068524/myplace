In such instances, it is crucial to dedicate resources to producing the most important results. We will demonstrate the Proactive Promotion Engine (PP) which employs a new preferential resource allocation methodology for priority processing of stream tuples. Our key contributions include: 1) our promotion continuous query language allows the specification of priorities within a query, 2) our promotion query algebra supports proactive promotion query processing, 3) our promotion query optimization locates an optimized PP query plan, and 4) our adaptive promotion control adapts online which subset of tuples are given priority online within a single physical query plan. Our \u201cPortland Home Arrest\u201d demonstration facilitates the capture of in-flight criminals using data generated by the Virginia Tech Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory via simulation-based modeling techniques.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Worcester Polytechnic Institute", "Worcester Polytechnic Institute"], "authors": ["Karen Works.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Works:Karen", "Elke A.
