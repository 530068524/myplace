{"title": "MistForm: Adaptive Shape Changing Fog Screens.", "fields": ["stereo display", "fog display", "brightness", "distortion", "rendering"], "abstract": "We present MistForm, a shape changing fog display that can support one or two users interacting with either 2D or 3D content. Mistform combines affordances from both shape changing interfaces and mid-air displays. For example, a concave display can maintain content in comfortable reach for a single user, while a convex shape can support several users engaged on individual tasks. MistForm also enables unique interaction possibilities by exploiting the synergies between shape changing interfaces and mid-air fog displays. For instance, moving the screen will affect the brightness and blurriness of the screen at specific locations around the display, creating spaces with similar (collaboration) or different visibility (personalized content). We describe the design of MistForm and analyse its inherent challenges, such as image distortion and uneven brightness on dynamic curved surfaces. We provide a machine learning approach to characterize the shape of the screen and a rendering algorithm to remove aberrations. We finally explore novel interactive possibilities and reflect on their potential and limitations.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Sussex", "University of Sussex", "University of Sussex", "University of Sussex"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Yutaka Tokuda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tokuda:Yutaka", "Mohd Adili Norasikin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Norasikin:Mohd_Adili", "Sriram Subramanian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Subramanian:Sriram", "Diego Mart\u00ednez Plasencia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Plasencia:Diego_Mart=iacute=nez"], "pages": 13}
