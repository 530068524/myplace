{"title": "SDNRacer: concurrency analysis for software-defined networks.", "fields": ["openflow", "debugging", "software defined networking", "concurrency", "invariant"], "abstract": "Concurrency violations are an important source of bugs in Software-Defined Networks (SDN), often leading to policy or invariant violations. Unfortunately, concurrency violations are also notoriously difficult to avoid, detect and debug. This paper presents a novel approach and a tool, SDNRacer, for detecting concurrency violations of SDNs. Our approach is enabled by three key ingredients: (i) a precise happens- before model for SDNs that captures when events can happen concurrently; (ii) a set of sound, domain-specific filters that reduce reported violations by orders of magnitude, and; (iii) a sound and complete dynamic analyzer, based on the above, that can ensure the network is free of harmful errors such as data races and per-packet incoherence. We evaluated SDNRacer on several real-world OpenFlow controllers, running both reactive and proactive applications in large networks. We show that SDNRacer is practically effective: it quickly pinpoints harmful concurrency violations without overwhelming the user with false positives.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Ahmed El-Hassany.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/El=Hassany:Ahmed", "Jeremie Miserez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miserez:Jeremie", "Pavol Bielik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bielik:Pavol", "Laurent Vanbever.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanbever:Laurent", "Martin T.
