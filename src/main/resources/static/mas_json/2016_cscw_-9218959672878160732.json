{"title": "Distinguishing between Personal Preferences and Social Influence in Online Activity Feeds.", "fields": ["homophily", "observational study", "social influence", "social network", "knowledge management"], "abstract": "Many online social networks thrive on automatic sharing of friends' activities to a user through activity feeds, which may influence the user's next actions. However, identifying such social influence is tricky because these activities are simultaneously impacted by influence and homophily. We propose a statistical procedure that uses commonly available network and observational data about people's actions to estimate the extent of copy-influence---mimicking others' actions that appear in a feed. We assume that non-friends don't influence users; thus, comparing how a user's activity correlates with friends versus non-friends who have similar preferences can help tease out the effect of copy-influence.   Experiments on datasets from multiple social networks show that estimates that don't account for homophily overestimate copy-influence by varying, often large amounts. Further, copy-influence estimates fall below 1% of total actions in all networks: most people, and almost all actions, are not affected by the feed. Our results question common perceptions around the extent of copy-influence in online social networks and suggest improvements to diffusion and recommendation models.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Amit Sharma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharma:Amit", "Dan Cosley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cosley:Dan"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
