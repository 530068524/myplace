{"title": "On Finding Socially Tenuous Groups for Online Social Networks.", "fields": ["graph", "exploit", "social group", "social network", "tera"], "abstract": "Existing research on finding social groups mostly focuses on  dense  subgraphs in social networks. However, finding  socially tenuous groups  also has many important applications. In this paper, we introduce the notion of  k-triangles  to measure the tenuity of a group. We then formulate a new research problem,  Minimum k-Triangle Disconnected Group (MkTG) , to find a socially tenuous group from online social networks. We prove that MkTG is NP-Hard and inapproximable within any ratio in arbitrary graphs but polynomial-time tractable in  threshold graphs . Two algorithms, namely  TERA  and  TERA-ADV , are designed to exploit graph-theoretical approaches for solving MkTG on general graphs effectively and efficiently. Experimental results on seven real datasets manifest that the proposed algorithms outperform existing approaches in both efficiency and solution quality.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National Tsing Hua University", "Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica", "National Chiao Tung University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Chih-Ya Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Chih=Ya", "Liang-Hao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Liang=Hao", "De-Nian Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:De=Nian", "Hong-Han Shuai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shuai:Hong=Han", "Wang-Chien Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wang=Chien", "Ming-Syan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ming=Syan"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 10}
