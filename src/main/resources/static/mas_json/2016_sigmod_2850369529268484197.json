In this demo we present REACT, a system that hooks to the analysis UI and provides the users with personalized recommendations of analysis actions. By matching the current user session to previous sessions of analysts working with the same or other data sets, REACT is able to identify the potentially best next analysis actions in the given user context. Unlike previous work that mainly focused on individual components of the analysis work, REACT provides a holistic approach that captures a wider range of analysis action types by utilizing novel notions of similarity in terms of the individual actions, the analyzed data and the entire analysis workflow.   We demonstrate the functionality of REACT, as well as its effectiveness through a digital forensics scenario where users are challenged to detect cyber attacks in real life data achieved from honeypot servers.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Tova Milo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milo:Tova", "Amit Somech.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Somech:Amit"], "pages": 4}
