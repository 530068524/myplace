In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning methodology for acquiring suitable interaction for each person's daily behavior. This time, we used vital sensors to detect and classify a user's condition. In an experiment, we show the feasibility of the proposed methodology.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Kwansei Gakuin University"], "authors": ["Junya Nakase.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakase:Junya", "Koichi Moriyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moriyama:Koichi", "Kiyoshi Kiyokawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiyokawa:Kiyoshi", "Masayuki Numao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Numao:Masayuki", "Mayumi Oyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oyama:Mayumi", "Satoshi Kurihara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurihara:Satoshi"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
