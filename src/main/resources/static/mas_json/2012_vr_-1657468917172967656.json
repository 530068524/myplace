Combining visual perception and interaction capabilities with the enormous storage and computational power of today's computer systems, especially with the rise of 3D virtual worlds, has great potential in providing deeper immersion and intuitive interactions with large data sets. In this demo, we exploit the potential of navigating large data-sets in a 3D virtual world, by transforming raw data sets into semantically rich, high level interactions and presenting data through rich, real-time visualization. We also explore the use of various digital devices that most users have available to build \u201cdistributed interfaces\u201d and provide capabilities that make interactions within the 3D space, and with the data sets presented in the 3D space, more natural and expressive.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Huaiyu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Huaiyu", "Mic Bowman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bowman:Mic", "Robert Adams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adams:Robert", "Dan Lake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lake:Dan", "Jerry Talton.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talton:Jerry", "Sean Koehl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koehl:Sean", "Robert Noradki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Noradki:Robert"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
