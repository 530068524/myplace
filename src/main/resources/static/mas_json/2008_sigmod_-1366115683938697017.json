{"title": "Preservation of proximity privacy in publishing numerical sensitive data.", "fields": ["k anonymity", "anonymity", "adversary", "publishing", "tuple"], "abstract": "We identify  proximity breach  as a privacy threat specific to numerical sensitive attributes in anonymized data publication. Such breach occurs when an adversary concludes with high confidence that the sensitive value of a victim individual must fall in a short interval --- even though the adversary may have low confidence about the victim's actual value.   None of the existing anonymization principles (e.g.,  k -anonymity,  l -diversity, etc.) can effectively prevent proximity breach. We remedy the problem by introducing a novel principle called (e,  m )-anonymity. Intuitively, the principle demands that, given a QI-group  G , for every sensitive value  x  in  G , at most 1/ m  of the tuples in  G  can have sensitive values \"similar\" to  x , where the similarity is controlled by e. We provide a careful analytical study of the theoretical characteristics of (e,  m )-anonymity, and the corresponding generalization algorithm. Our findings are verified by experiments with real data.", "citation": "Citations (141)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Jiexing Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Jiexing", "Yufei Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Yufei", "Xiaokui Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Xiaokui"], "pages": 14}
