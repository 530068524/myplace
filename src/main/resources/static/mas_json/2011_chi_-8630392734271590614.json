{"title": "Tactile feedback can assist vision during mobile interactions.", "fields": ["mobile interaction", "human computer interaction", "scrolling", "tactile transducer", "word error rate"], "abstract": "We evaluated the use of rich tactile feedback in the task of scrolling through a long list of items. We used a hand-held device having a tactile transducer that could provide sensations with temporal and spatial content. These capabilities were put to use in an interaction metaphor where input and tactile feedback were tightly coupled. We measured time- to-target and error rates, but also measured the time spent by participants to look at the screen. We found a 28% decrease of reliance on vision when tactile feedback was enabled.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["BlackBerry Limited", "UPMC Univ Paris ... , Paris, France"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Pasquero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasquero:J=eacute=r=ocirc=me", "Vincent Hayward.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayward:Vincent"], "pages": 4}
