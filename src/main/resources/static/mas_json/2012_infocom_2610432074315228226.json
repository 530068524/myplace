In this work, we first define precisely corrupted packets in inter-session pollution based on the commitment of the source packets. We then propose three detection schemes: one hash-based and two MAC-based schemes: InterM acCPK  and SpaceMac PM . Inter MacCPK  is the first multi-source homomorphic MAC scheme that supports multiple keys. Both MAC schemes can replace traditional MACs, e.g., HMAC, in networks that employ inter-session coding. All three schemes provide in-network detection, are collusion-resistant, and have very low online bandwidth and computation overhead.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Anh Le.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Le:Anh", "Athina Markopoulou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markopoulou:Athina"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
