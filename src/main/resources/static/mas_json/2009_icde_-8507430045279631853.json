{"title": "Web Monitoring 2.0: Crossing Streams to Satisfy Complex Data Needs.", "fields": ["information needs", "mashup", "schedule", "complex data type", "web 2 0"], "abstract": "Web Monitoring 2.0 supports the complex information needs of clients who probe multiple information sources and generate mashups by integrating across these volatile streams. A proxy that aims at satisfying multiple customized client profiles will face a scalability challenge in trying to maximize the number of clients served while at the same time fully satisfying complex client needs. In this paper, we introduce an abstraction of complex execution intervals, a combination of time intervals and information streams, to capture complex client needs. Given some budgetary constraints (e.g., bandwidth), we present offline algorithmic solutions for the problem of maximizing completeness of capturing complex profiles.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Haggai Roitman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roitman:Haggai", "Avigdor Gal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gal:Avigdor", "Louiqa Raschid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raschid:Louiqa"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
