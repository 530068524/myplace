{"title": "Non-Monotone DR-Submodular Function Maximization.", "fields": ["monotone polygon", "submodular set function", "orders of magnitude", "set function", "integer lattice"], "abstract": "We consider non-monotone DR-submodular function maximization, where DR-submodularity (diminishing return submodularity) is an extension of submodularity for functions over the integer lattice based on the concept of the diminishing return property. Maximizing non-monotone DR-submodular functions has many applications in machine learning that cannot be captured by submodular set functions. In this paper, we present a $\\frac{1}{2+\\epsilon}$-approximation algorithm with a running time of roughly $O(\\frac{n}{\\epsilon}\\log^2 B)$, where $n$ is the size of the ground set, $B$ is the maximum value of a coordinate, and $\\epsilon > 0$ is a parameter. The approximation ratio is almost tight and the dependency of running time on $B$ is exponentially smaller than the naive greedy algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm outputs almost the best solution compared to other baseline algorithms, whereas its running time is several orders of magnitude faster.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "National Institute of Informatics"], "authors": ["Tasuku Soma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soma:Tasuku", "Yuichi Yoshida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshida:Yuichi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
