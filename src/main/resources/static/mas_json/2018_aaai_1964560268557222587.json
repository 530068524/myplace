To realize this, we propose a sparse yet rich factor graph representation of f to be exploited for designing an acquisition function that can be similarly represented by a sparse factor graph and hence be efficiently optimized in a decentralized manner using distributed message passing. Despite richly characterizing the interdependent effects of the input components on the output of f with a factor graph, DEC-HBO can still guarantee no-regret performance asymptotically. Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world experiments (e.g., sparse Gaussian process model with 1811 hyperparameters) shows that DEC-HBO outperforms the state-of-the-art HBO algorithms.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": [], "authors": ["Trong Nghia Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Trong_Nghia", "Quang Minh Hoang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoang:Quang_Minh", "Ruofei Ouyang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouyang:Ruofei", "Kian Hsiang Low.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Low:Kian_Hsiang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
