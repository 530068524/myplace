Developers now use JavaScript not only for the client-side but also for server-side programming, leading to \"full-stack\" applications written entirely in JavaScript. Understanding such applications is challenging for developers, due to the temporal and implicit relations of asynchronous and event-driven entities spread over the client and server side. We propose a technique for capturing a behavioural model of full-stack JavaScript applications' execution. The model is temporal and context-sensitive to accommodate asynchronous events, as well as the scheduling and execution of lifelines of callbacks. We present a visualization of the model to facilitate program understanding for developers. We implement our approach in a tool, called Sahand, and evaluate it through a controlled experiment. The results show that Sahand improves developers' performance in completing program comprehension tasks by increasing their accuracy by a factor of three.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Saba Alimadadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alimadadi:Saba", "Ali Mesbah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mesbah_0001:Ali", "Karthik Pattabiraman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pattabiraman:Karthik"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
