Looking at the exchange of information about \"underground\" shows, we use qualitative interviews to examine uses of social media among fans. This initial analysis centers on understanding the tactical practices of information and technology to avoid police detection, particularly by comparing uses of more traditional online forums, such as message boards, with social network sites, such as Facebook. Understanding the uses and preferences for distinct technologies sheds light on how localized social context drives technological use. These findings are furthermore useful in their implications for design of applications sensitive to granular needs of users for secrecy.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Jessica Lingel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lingel:Jessica", "Aaron Trammell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trammell:Aaron", "Joe Sanchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanchez:Joe", "Mor Naaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naaman:Mor"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
