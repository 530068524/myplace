Our recent attempts at implementing this vision [4,6], show significant improvement in the system response time (SRT) for subgraph queries. However, these efforts are designed specifically for graph databases containing a large collection of small or medium-sized graphs. Consequently, its frequent fragment-based action-aware indexing schemes and query processing strategy are unsuitable for supporting subgraph queries on large networks containing thousands of nodes and edges. In this demonstration, we present a novel system called QUBLE (QUery Blender for Large nEtworks) to realize this novel paradigm on large networks. We demonstrate various innovative features of QUBLE and its promising performance.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Hong Kong Baptist University", "Fudan University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ho Hoang Hung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hung:Ho_Hoang", "Sourav S.
