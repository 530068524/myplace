{"title": "Discretized Multinomial Distributions and Nash Equilibria in Anonymous Games.", "fields": ["unit vector", "bounded function", "total variation", "stein s method", "ranging"], "abstract": "We show that there is a polynomial-time approximation scheme for computing Nash equilibria in anonymous games with any fixed number of strategies (a very broad and important class of games), extending the two-strategy result of Daskalakis and Papadimitriou 2007. The approximation guarantee follows from a probabilistic result of more general interest: The distribution of the sum of n independent unit vectors with values ranging over {e 1 ,...,ek}, where e i  is the unit vector along dimension i of the k-dimensional Euclidean space, can be approximated by the distribution of the sum of another set of independent unit vectors whose probabilities of obtaining each value are multiples of 1/z for some integer z, and so that the variational distance of the two distributions is at most eps, where eps is bounded by an inverse polynomial in z and a function of k, but with no dependence on n. Our probabilistic result specifies the construction of a surprisingly sparse epsi-cover- under the total variation distance - of the set of distributions of sums of independent unit vectors, which is of interest on its own right.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Constantinos Daskalakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daskalakis:Constantinos", "Christos H.
