{"title": "A User-Powered American Sign Language Dictionary.", "fields": ["small set", "latent semantic analysis", "simple features", "crowdsourcing", "american sign language"], "abstract": "Students learning American Sign Language (ASL) have trouble searching for the meaning of unfamiliar signs. ASL signs can be differentiated by a small set of simple  features  including hand shape, orientation, location, and movement. In a feature-based ASL-to-English dictionary, users search for a sign by providing a query, which is a set of observed features. Because there is natural variability in the way signs are executed, and observations are error-prone, an approach other than exact matching of features is needed. We propose ASL-Search, an ASL-to-English dictionary entirely powered by its users. ASL-Search utilizes Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on a database of feature-based user queries to account for variability. To demonstrate ASL-Search's viability, we created ASL-Flash, a learning tool that presents online flashcards to ASL students and provides query data. Our simulations on this data serve as a proof of concept, demonstrating that our dictionary's performance improves with use and performs well for users with varied levels of ASL experience.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Danielle Bragg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bragg:Danielle", "Kyle Rector.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rector:Kyle", "Richard E.
