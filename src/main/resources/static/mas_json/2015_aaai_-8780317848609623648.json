However, generic social media platforms are not explicitly designed to assist information seeking of users. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to identify the social connections of a user able to satisfy his information needs. The information need of a social media user is subjective and personal, and we investigate the utility of his social context to identify people able to satisfy it. We present questions users post on Twitter as instances of information seeking activities in social media. We infer soft community memberships of the asker and his social connections by integrating network and content information. Drawing concepts from the social foci theory, we identify answerers who share communities with the asker w.r.t. the question. Our experiments demonstrate that the framework is effective in identifying answerers to social media questions.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Suhas Ranganath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranganath:Suhas", "Jiliang Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Jiliang", "Xia Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Xia", "Hari Sundaram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sundaram:Hari", "Huan Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0001:Huan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
