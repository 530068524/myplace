{"title": "An Adaptive Computational Model for Personalized Persuasion.", "fields": ["network model", "management science", "persuasion", "elaboration likelihood model", "simulation"], "abstract": "While a variety of persuasion agents have been created and applied in different domains such as marketing, military training and health industry, there is a lack of a model which can provide a unified framework for different persuasion strategies. Specifically, persuasion is not adaptable to the individuals' personal states in different situations. Grounded in the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), this paper presents a computational model called Model for Adaptive Persuasion (MAP) for virtual agents. MAP is a semi-connected network model which enables an agent to adapt its persuasion strategies through feedback. We have implemented and evaluated a MAP-based virtual nurse agent who takes care and recommends healthy lifestyle habits to the elderly. Our experimental results show that the MAP-based agent is able to change the others' attitudes and behaviors intentionally, interpret individual differences between users, and adapt to user's behavior for effective persuasion.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Yilin Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Yilin", "Ah-Hwee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Ah=Hwee", "Chunyan Miao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miao:Chunyan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
