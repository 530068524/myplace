We prove that for any k \u2265 2, the mixture of k Plackett-Luce models for no more than 2k-1 alternatives is non-identifiable and this bound is tight for k = 2. For generic identifiability, we prove that the mixture of k Plackett-Luce models over m alternatives is generically identifiable if k \u2264 \u230am-2/2\u230b!. We also propose an efficient generalized method of moments (GMM) algorithm to learn the mixture of two Plackett-Luce models and show that the algorithm is consistent. Our experiments show that our GMM algorithm is significantly faster than the EMM algorithm by Gormley & Murphy (2008), while achieving competitive statistical efficiency.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Zhibing Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zhibing", "Peter Piech.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Piech:Peter", "Lirong Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Lirong"], "pages": 9}
