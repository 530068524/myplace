{"title": "Tracking Certificate Misissuance in the Wild.", "fields": ["public key infrastructure", "lint", "cryptography", "certificate", "certificate authority"], "abstract": "Certificate Authorities (CAs) regularly make mechanical errors when issuing certificates. To quantify these errors, we introduce ZLint, a certificate linter that codifies the policies set forth by the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements and RFC 5280 that can be tested in isolation. We run ZLint on browser-trusted certificates in Censys and systematically analyze how well CAs construct certificates. We find that the number errors has drastically reduced since 2012. In 2017, only 0.02% of certificates have errors. However, this is largely due to a handful of large authorities that consistently issue correct certificates. There remains a long tail of small authorities that regularly issue non-conformant certificates. We further find that issuing certificates with errors is correlated with other types of mismanagement and for large authorities, browser action. Drawing on our analysis, we conclude with a discussion on how the community can best use lint data to identify authorities with worrisome organizational practices and ensure long-term health of the Web PKI.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Deepak Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Deepak", "Zhengping Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhengping", "Matthew Hyder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hyder:Matthew", "Joseph Dickinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dickinson:Joseph", "Gabrielle Beck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beck:Gabrielle", "David Adrian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Adrian:David", "Joshua Mason.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mason:Joshua", "Zakir Durumeric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durumeric:Zakir", "J.
