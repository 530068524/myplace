Interaction (i.e., control of car acceleration) is enabled through the use of two real exercises 1) a half crouching exercise, and 2) a crouching and rising exercise. In two within subjects user studies, with 27 participants in half crouching and another 30 participants in crouching and rising respectively, we compared exercises in-game to the same exercises without the game, focusing on the physiological and motivational impact of mapping exercises as interfaces to games.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Texas at San Antonio", "University of Texas at San Antonio"], "authors": ["Rongkai Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Rongkai", "John Quarles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quarles:John"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2012", "pages": 2}
