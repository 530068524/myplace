Our approach mines product descriptions from publicly available online specifications, utilizes text mining and a novel incremental diffusive clustering algorithm to discover domain-specific features, generates a probabilistic feature model that represents commonalities, variants, and cross-category features, and then uses association rule mining and the  k -Nearest-Neighbor machine learning strategy to generate product specific feature recommendations. Our recommender system supports the relatively labor-intensive task of domain analysis, potentially increasing opportunities for re-use, reducing time-to-market, and delivering more competitive software products. The approach is empirically validated against 20 different product categories using thousands of product descriptions mined from a repository of free software applications.", "citation": "Citations (130)", "departments": ["DePaul University", "DePaul University", "DePaul University", "DePaul University", "DePaul University"], "authors": ["Horatiu Dumitru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dumitru:Horatiu", "Marek Gibiec.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gibiec:Marek", "Negar Hariri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hariri:Negar", "Jane Cleland-Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cleland=Huang:Jane", "Bamshad Mobasher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mobasher:Bamshad", "Carlos Castro-Herrera.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Castro=Herrera:Carlos", "Mehdi Mirakhorli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mirakhorli:Mehdi"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
