Beyond many commercial application, satellite data is helpful to create situation awareness in disaster recovery and emergency situations such as wildfires, earthquakes, or flooding. To fully utilize such data sources, we present a scalable system for the contextual enrichment of satellite images by crawling and analyzing multimedia content from social media. This information stream can provide vital information from the ground and help to complement remote sensing in situations. We use Twitter as main data source and analyze its textual, visual, temporal, geographical and social dimensions. Visualizations show different aspects of the event allowing high-level comprehension and provide deeper insights into the event as complemented by social media.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence"], "authors": ["Benjamin Bischke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bischke:Benjamin", "Damian Borth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borth:Damian", "Christian Schulze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schulze:Christian", "Andreas Dengel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dengel:Andreas"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 5}
