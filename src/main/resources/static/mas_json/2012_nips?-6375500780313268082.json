{"title": "Learning Halfspaces with the Zero-One Loss: Time-Accuracy Tradeoffs.", "fields": ["time complexity", "sample complexity", "word error rate", "interpolation", "exponential function"], "abstract": "Given \u03b1, e, we study the time complexity required to improperly learn a halfs-pace with misclassification error rate of at most (1 + \u03b1) L*\u03b3 + e, where L*\u03b3 is the optimal \u03b3-margin error rate. For \u03b1 = 1/\u03b3, polynomial time and sample complexity is achievable using the hinge-loss. For \u03b1 = 0, Shalev-Shwartz et al. [2011] showed that poly(1/\u03b3) time is impossible, while learning is possible in time exp(O(1/\u03b3)). An immediate question, which this paper tackles, is what is achievable if \u03b1 e (0, 1/\u03b3). We derive positive results interpolating between the polynomial time for \u03b1 = 1/\u03b3 and the exponential time for \u03b1 = 0. In particular, we show that there are cases in which \u03b1 = o(1/\u03b3) but the problem is still solvable in polynomial time. Our results naturally extend to the adversarial online learning model and to the PAC learning with malicious noise model.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "authors": ["Aharon Birnbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Birnbaum:Aharon", "Shai Shalev-Shwartz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shalev=Shwartz:Shai"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
