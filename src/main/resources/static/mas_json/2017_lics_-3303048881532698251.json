Stone-type dualities abound in computer science and have been of great use in understanding the relationship between computational models and the languages used to reason about them. Recent work on probabilistic processes has established a Stone-type duality for a restricted class of Markov processes. The dual category was a new notion\u2014Aumann algebras\u2014which are Boolean algebras equipped with countable family of modalities indexed by rational probabilities. In this article we consider an alternative definition of Aumann algebra that leads to dual adjunction for Markov processes that is a duality for many measurable spaces occurring in practice. This extends a duality for measurable spaces due to Sikorski. In particular, we do not require that the probabilistic modalities preserve a distinguished base of clopen sets, nor that morphisms of Markov processes do so. The extra generality allows us to give a perspicuous definition of event bisimulation on Aumann algebras.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Cornell University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "McGill University"], "authors": ["Robert Furber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Furber:Robert", "Dexter Kozen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kozen:Dexter", "Kim G.
