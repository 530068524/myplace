{"title": "Flexible, High Performance Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification.", "fields": ["convolutional neural network", "numerical digit", "mnist database", "cuda", "contextual image classification"], "abstract": "We present a fast, fully parameterizable GPU implementation of Convolutional Neural Network variants. Our feature extractors are neither carefully designed nor pre-wired, but rather learned in a supervised way. Our deep hierarchical architectures achieve the best published results on benchmarks for object classification (NORB, CIFAR10) and handwritten digit recognition (MNIST), with error rates of 2.53%, 19.51%, 0.35%, respectively. Deep nets trained by simple back-propagation perform better than more shallow ones. Learning is surprisingly rapid. NORB is completely trained within five epochs. Test error rates on MNIST drop to 2.42%, 0.97% and 0.48% after 1, 3 and 17 epochs, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (662)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research", "Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Dan Claudiu Ciresan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciresan:Dan_Claudiu", "Ueli Meier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meier:Ueli", "Jonathan Masci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Masci:Jonathan", "Luca Maria Gambardella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gambardella:Luca_Maria", "J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmidhuber:J=uuml=rgen"], "pages": 6}
