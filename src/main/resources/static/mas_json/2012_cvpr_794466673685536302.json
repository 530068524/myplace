To this end, we generalize recently introduced convex formulations for scalar functionals to the vector-valued scenario in such a way that discontinuities in the different color channels preferably coincide. Furthermore, we propose an efficient solution which makes the overall optimization problem as tractable as in the scalar-valued case. Numerous experimental comparisons with the naive channel-wise approach, with the well-known Ambrosio-Tortorelli approximation, and with the classical total variation confirm the advantages of the proposed relaxation for contrastpreserving and edge-enhancing regularization.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Evgeny Strekalovskiy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strekalovskiy:Evgeny", "Antonin Chambolle.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chambolle:Antonin", "Daniel Cremers.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cremers:Daniel"], "pages": 8}
