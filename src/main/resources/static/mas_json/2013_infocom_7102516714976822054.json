Such a capacity gain through power enhancement is revealed by our new insights of a co-channel enlarging effect. In particular, when the number of available channels (c) in a network is larger than that necessary for enabling the maximum set of simultaneous transmissions (c\u0303), allocating transmissions to those additional c-c\u0303 channels could enlarge the distance between the co-channel transmissions; the larger co-channel distance then allows a higher transmission power for higher link capacity. The finding of this paper specifically indicate that by exploiting the co-channel enlarging effect with power, one can realize the following gain on the capacity for MR-MC wireless networks: (i) In the channel-constraint region (c\u0303  min  to P min  c/c\u0303 \u03b1/2 , then a gain of \u0398(log(c/c\u0303) \u03b1/2 ) is achieved; (ii) In the power-constraint region (c \u2265 n\u03c6/2), if each node sends at the maximum power level, P max  = P min .n K  or P min .2n\u03c6/2, depending on the power availability at a node, then a gain of \u0398(log n) or \u0398(n) is achieved, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Illinois Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Devu Manikantan Shila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shila:Devu_Manikantan", "Yu Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng_0003:Yu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
