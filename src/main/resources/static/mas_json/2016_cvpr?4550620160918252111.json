Any autonomous vehicle navigating such a scene should be able to foresee the future positions of pedestrians and accordingly adjust its path to avoid collisions. This problem of trajectory prediction can be viewed as a sequence generation task, where we are interested in predicting the future trajectory of people based on their past positions. Following the recent success of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models for sequence prediction tasks, we propose an LSTM model which can learn general human movement and predict their future trajectories. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which use hand-crafted functions such as Social forces. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several public datasets. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on some of these datasets. We also analyze the trajectories predicted by our model to demonstrate the motion behaviour learned by our model.", "citation": "Citations (236)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Alexandre Alahi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alahi:Alexandre", "Kratarth Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Kratarth", "Vignesh Ramanathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanathan:Vignesh", "Alexandre Robicquet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robicquet:Alexandre", "Fei-Fei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Fei=Fei", "Silvio Savarese.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savarese:Silvio"], "pages": 11}
