{"title": "Automata-Based Model Counting for String Constraints.", "fields": ["string metric", "constraint logic programming", "string", "string searching algorithm", "constraint"], "abstract": "Most common vulnerabilities in Web applications are due to string manipulation errors in input validation and sanitization code. String constraint solvers are essential components of program analysis techniques for detecting and repairing vulnerabilities that are due to string manipulation errors. For quantitative and probabilistic program analyses, checking the satisfiability of a constraint is not sufficient, and it is necessary to count the number of solutions. In this paper, we present a constraint solver that, given a string constraint, (1) constructs an automaton that accepts all solutions that satisfy the constraint, (2) generates a function that, given a length bound, gives the total number of solutions within that bound. Our approach relies on the observation that, using an automata-based constraint representation, model counting reduces to path counting, which can be solved precisely. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large set of string constraints extracted from real-world web applications.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Abdulbaki Aydin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aydin:Abdulbaki", "Lucas Bang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bang:Lucas", "Tevfik Bultan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bultan:Tevfik"], "pages": 18}
