Landmark papers [9,10] have recently shown how computational models of gene regulatory networks provide system-level causal understanding of the developmental processes of the sea urchin, and enable powerful predictive capabilities. A crucial aspect of the work is empirically deriving plausible models that explain all the known experimental data, a task that becomes infeasible in practice due to the inherent complexity of the biological systems. We present a generic Satisfiability Modulo Theories based approach to analyze and synthesize data constrained models. We apply our approach to the sea urchin embryo, and successfully improve the state-of-the-art by synthesizing, for the first time, models that explain all the experimental observations in [10]. A strength of the proposed approach is the combination of accurate synthesis procedures for deriving biologically plausible models with the ability to prove inconsistency results, showing that for a given set of experiments and possible class of models no solution exists, and thus enabling practical refutation of biological models.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Nicola Paoletti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paoletti:Nicola", "Boyan Yordanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yordanov:Boyan", "Youssef Hamadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hamadi:Youssef", "Christoph M.
