The novel scheme is obtained as a result of a modification of the rejection sampling algorithm that is at the heart of Lyubashevsky\u2019s signature scheme (Eurocrypt, 2012) and several other lattice primitives. Our new rejection sampling algorithm which samples from a bimodal Gaussian distribution, combined with a modified scheme instantiation, ends up reducing the standard deviation of the resulting signatures by a factor that is asymptotically square root in the security parameter. The implementations of our signature scheme for security levels of 128, 160, and 192 bits compare very favorably to existing schemes such as RSA and ECDSA in terms of efficiency. In addition, the new scheme has shorter signature and public key sizes than all previously proposed lattice signature schemes.", "citation": "Citations (313)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "authors": ["L\u00e9o Ducas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ducas:L=eacute=o", "Alain Durmus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durmus:Alain", "Tancr\u00e8de Lepoint.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lepoint:Tancr=egrave=de", "Vadim Lyubashevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lyubashevsky:Vadim"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2013", "pages": 17}
