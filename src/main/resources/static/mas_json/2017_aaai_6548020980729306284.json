{"title": "TextBoxes: A Fast Text Detector with a Single Deep Neural Network.", "fields": ["detector", "pattern recognition", "artificial intelligence", "artificial neural network", "machine learning"], "abstract": "This paper presents an end-to-end trainable fast scene text detector, named TextBoxes, which detects scene text with both high accuracy and efficiency in a single network forward pass, involving no post-process except for a standard non-maximum suppression. TextBoxes outperforms competing methods in terms of text localization accuracy and is much faster, taking only 0.09s per image in a fast implementation. Furthermore, combined with a text recognizer, TextBoxes significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on word spotting and end-to-end text recognition tasks.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "departments": ["Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "Huazhong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Minghui Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Minghui", "Baoguang Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Baoguang", "Xiang Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Xiang", "Xinggang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinggang", "Wenyu Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wenyu"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
