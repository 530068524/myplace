In an experiment in which participants played detectives solving homicides, we tested the utility of a visualization of data links and a notepad for collecting and organizing annotations. The visualization significantly improved participants' ability to solve the crime whereas the notepad did not. Having both features available provided no benefit over having just the visualization. The results raise questions about the potential constraints on the usefulness of intelligence analysis tools.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Nitesh Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Nitesh", "Gilly Leshed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leshed:Gilly", "Susan R.
