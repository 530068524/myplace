It is however well known that GAN training suffers from instability due to the nature of its saddle point formulation. In this paper, we explore ways to tackle the instability problem by dualizing the discriminator. We start from linear discriminators in which case conjugate duality provides a mechanism to reformulate the saddle point objective into a maximization problem, such that both the generator and the discriminator of this \u2018dualing GAN\u2019 act in concert. We then demonstrate how to extend this intuition to non-linear formulations. For GANs with linear discriminators our approach is able to remove the instability in training, while for GANs with nonlinear discriminators our approach provides an alternative to the commonly used GAN training algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yujia Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yujia", "Alexander G.
