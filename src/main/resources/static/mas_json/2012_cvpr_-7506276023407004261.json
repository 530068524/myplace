This task is unique from traditional synthesize algorithms due to its mixed modality between the input and output; i.e., our goal is to synthesize surface normals given an intensity image input. To accomplish this task, we propose a framework that first applies intrinsic image decomposition to produce a pair of initial normal maps. These maps are combined into a conditional random field (CRF) optimization framework that incorporates additional information derived from a training set consisting of normals captured using photometric stereo on oil paintings with similar brush styles. Additional constraints are incorporated into the CRF framework to further ensures smoothness and preserve brush stroke edges. Our results show that this approach can produce compelling reliefs that are often indistinguishable from results captured using photometric stereo.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "National University of Singapore", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wei Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Wei", "Zheng Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu_0002:Zheng", "Xiaogang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiaogang", "Ying-Qing Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Ying=Qing", "Moshe Ben-Ezra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=Ezra:Moshe", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou", "Michael S.
