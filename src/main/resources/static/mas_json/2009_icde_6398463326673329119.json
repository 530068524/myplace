In this demonstration, we showcase a Web-based integrated platform which performs online detection of near-duplicate occurrences over continuous video streams, as well as retrieval of near-duplicate clips from segmented video collections. In particular, our method to detect relevant subsequences in a streaming video is characterized by a novel one-dimensional distance trajectory capturing the changes of consecutive frames. Such a trajectory is further represented by a sequence of compact signatures. An effective similarity measure is devised to compare the trajectory with multiple query videos. This system shows a number of new features compared with our previous prototype.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland"], "authors": ["Zi Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Zi", "Liping Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0002:Liping", "Heng Tao Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Heng_Tao", "Jie Shao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shao:Jie", "Xiaofang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiaofang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
