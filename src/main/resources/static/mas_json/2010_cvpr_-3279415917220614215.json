{"title": "A theory of phase-sensitive rotation invariance with spherical harmonic and moment-based representations.", "fields": ["harmonic analysis", "invariant", "bispectrum", "coordinate rotations and reflections"], "abstract": "This paper describes how phase-sensitive rotation invariants for three-dimensional data may be obtained. A \u201cbispectrum\u201d is formulated for rotations, and its properties are derived for spherical harmonic coefficients as well as for moments. The bispectral invariants offer improved discrimination over previously published magnitude-only invariants. They are able to distinguish rotations from reflections, as well as rotations of an entire shape from component-wise rotations of elements of the shape. As experiments show, they provide robust performance for both surface and voxel data.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ramakrishna Kakarala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kakarala:Ramakrishna", "Dansheng Mao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mao:Dansheng"], "pages": 8}
