But whether the technology in its current state will be a commercially and technically viable alternative to entrenched technologies such as flash-based SSDs remains undecided. To address this, it is important to consider PCM SSD devices not just from a device standpoint, but also from a holistic perspective.   This article presents the results of our performance study of a recent all-PCM SSD prototype. The average latency for a 4KiB random read is 6.7\u03bcs, which is about 16\u00d7 faster than a comparable eMLC flash SSD. The distribution of I/O response times is also much narrower than flash SSD for both reads and writes. Based on the performance measurements and real-world workload traces, we explore two typical storage use cases: tiering and caching. We report that the IOPS/$ of a tiered storage system can be improved by 12--66p and the aggregate elapsed time of a server-side caching solution can be improved by up to 35p by adding PCM.   Our results show that (even at current price points) PCM storage devices show promising performance as a new component in enterprise storage systems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Hyojun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hyojun", "Sangeetha Seshadri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seshadri:Sangeetha", "Clement L.
