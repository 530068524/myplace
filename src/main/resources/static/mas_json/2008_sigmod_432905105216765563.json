Top- k  queries (also known as ranking queries) are often natural and useful in analyzing uncertain data in those applications. In this paper, we study the problem of answering probabilistic threshold top- k  queries on uncertain data, which computes uncertain records taking a probability of at least  p  to be in the top- k  list where  p  is a user specified probability threshold. We present an efficient exact algorithm, a fast sampling algorithm, and a Poisson approximation based algorithm. An empirical study using real and synthetic data sets verifies the effectiveness of probabilistic threshold top- k  queries and the efficiency of our methods.", "citation": "Citations (326)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "University of New South Wales", "University of New South Wales"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ming Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua_0001:Ming", "Jian Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Jian", "Wenjie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Wenjie", "Xuemin Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Xuemin"], "pages": 14}
