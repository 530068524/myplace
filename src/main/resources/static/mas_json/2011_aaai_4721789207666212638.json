{"title": "Dual Decomposition for Marginal Inference.", "fields": ["inference", "differentiable function", "order of magnitude", "ising model", "belief propagation"], "abstract": "We present a dual decomposition approach to the tree-reweighted belief propagation objective. Each tree in the tree-reweighted bound yields one subproblem, which can be solved with the sum-product algorithm. The master problem is a simple differentiable optimization, to which a standard optimization method can be applied. Experimental results on 10x10 Ising models show the dual decomposition approach using L-BFGS is similar in settings where message-passing converges quickly, and one to two orders of magnitude faster in settings where message-passing requires many iterations, specifically high accuracy convergence, and strong interactions.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Rochester Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Justin Domke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Domke:Justin"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
