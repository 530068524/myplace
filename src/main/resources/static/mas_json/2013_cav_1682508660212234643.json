Despite substantial advances in verification technology, complexity issues with classical decision procedures for nonlinear real arithmetic are still a major obstacle for formal verification of real-world applications.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["SRI International", "fortiss GmbH, M ... nchen, Germany", "fortiss GmbH, M ... nchen, Germany"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Chih-Hong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Chih=Hong", "Harald Ruess.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruess:Harald", "Natarajan Shankar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shankar:Natarajan"], "pages": 6}
