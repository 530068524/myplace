This influence estimation problem is very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the task and the requirement of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm for influence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. Our algorithm can estimate the influence of every node in a network with |V| nodes and |e| edges to an accuracy of e using n = O(1/e2) randomizations and up to logarithmic factors O(n|e| + n|V|) computations. When used as a subroutine in a greedy influence maximization approach, our proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find a set of C nodes with the influence of at least (1 - 1/e) OPT -2Ce, where OPT is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed algorithm can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes while significantly improves over previous state-of-the-arts in terms of the accuracy of the estimated influence and the quality of the selected nodes in maximizing the influence.", "citation": "Citations (188)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Max Planck Society", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Nan Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Nan", "Le Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Le", "Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gomez=Rodriguez:Manuel", "Hongyuan Zha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zha:Hongyuan"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
