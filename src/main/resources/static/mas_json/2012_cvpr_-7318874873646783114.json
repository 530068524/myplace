Majority of models are based on low-level visual features and the importance of top-down factors has not yet been fully explored or modeled. Here, we combine low-level features such as orientation, color, intensity, saliency maps of previous best bottom-up models with top-down cognitive visual features (e.g., faces, humans, cars, etc.) and learn a direct mapping from those features to eye fixations using Regression, SVM, and AdaBoost classifiers. By extensive experimenting over three benchmark eye-tracking datasets using three popular evaluation scores, we show that our boosting model outperforms 27 state-of-the-art models and is so far the closest model to the accuracy of human model for fixation prediction. Furthermore, our model successfully detects the most salient object in a scene without sophisticated image processings such as region segmentation.", "citation": "Citations (200)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Southern California"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ali Borji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borji:Ali"], "pages": 8}
