In this setting, we address the fundamental problem of computing the probability that a set of arguments is an extension according to a given semantics. We focus on the most popular semantics (i.e., admissible, stable, complete, grounded, preferred, ideal), and show the following dichotomy result: computing the probability that a set of arguments is an extension is either PTIME or FP#P -complete depending on the semantics adopted. Our PTIME results are particularly interesting, as they hold for some semantics for which no polynomial-time technique was known so far.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Calabria", "University of Calabria", "University of Calabria"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Bettina Fazzinga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fazzinga:Bettina", "Sergio Flesca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Flesca:Sergio", "Francesco Parisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parisi:Francesco"], "pages": 7}
