For cost-efficient data collection, vast amount of 3D samples are collected by limited mobile carriers with built-in low-cost sensors. A 3D probabilistic concentration estimated method (3D-PCEM) is proposed to infer PM2.5 concentration for undetected area, so that the accuracy of BlueAer is ensured. A prototype system of BlueAer has been implemented and worked throughout a year in a 64km2 testing area with a population of 400,000 in Hangzhou, China. Experimental data has verified that BlueAer can achieve good performance in terms of stability as well as a fine grained 3D distribution of PM2.5 concentration. The inference accuracy of 3D-PCEM is enhanced by 15.4% and 41.0%, comparing to Gaussian Process (GP) and Artificial Network (ANN) respectively. BlueAer can easily be extended for a larger scale and applied city-wise. Besides, our findings can help ordinary citizens better understand their immediate air quality and serve as a framework towards detailed national-wise real-time pollution management.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Hangzhou Dianzi University", "Hangzhou Dianzi University", "Hangzhou Dianzi University", "Hangzhou Dianzi University", "Hangzhou Dianzi University"], "authors": ["Yidan Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Yidan", "Guojun Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Guojun", "Jin Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Jin", "Yifan Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yifan", "Hua Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hua"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
