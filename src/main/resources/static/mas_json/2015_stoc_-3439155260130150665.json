This shows that a communication protocol for a partial boolean function cannot always be compressed to its internal information. By a result of Braverman [Bra12], our gap is the largest possible. By a result of Braverman and Rao [BR11], our example shows a gap between communication complexity and amortized communication complexity, implying that a tight direct sum result for distributional communication complexity of boolean functions cannot hold, answering a long standing open problem. Our techniques build on [GKR14], that proved a similar result for relations with very long outputs (double exponentially long in k). In addition to the stronger result, the current work gives a simpler proof, benefiting from the short output length of boolean functions.   Another (conceptual) contribution of our work is the relative discrepancy method, a new rectangle-based method for proving communication complexity lower bounds for boolean functions, powerful enough to separate information complexity and communication complexity.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Institute for Advanced Study", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Institute for Advanced Study"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Anat Ganor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganor:Anat", "Gillat Kol.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kol:Gillat", "Ran Raz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raz:Ran"], "pages": 10}
