{"title": "Learning to rank from distant supervision: Exploiting noisy redundancy for relational entity search.", "fields": ["learning to rank", "executable", "probabilistic logic", "ranking svm", "ranking"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the task of relational entity search which aims at automatically learning an entity ranking function for a desired relation. To rank entities, we exploit the redundancy abound in their snippets; however, such redundancy is noisy as not all the snippets represent information relevant to the desired relation. To explore useful information from such noisy redundancy, we abstract the task as a distantly supervised ranking problem - based on coarse entity-level annotations, deriving a relation-specific ranking function for the purpose of online searching. As the key challenge, without detailed snippet-level annotations, we have to learn an entity ranking function that can effectively filter noise; furthermore, the ranking function should also be online executable. We develop Pattern-based Filter Network (PFNet), a novel probabilistic graphical model, as our solution. To balance the accuracy and efficiency requirements, PFNet selects a limited size of indicative patterns to filter noisy snippets, and inverted indexes are utilized to retrieve required features. Experiments on the large scale CuleWeb09 data set for six different relations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PFNet model, which outperforms five state-of-the-art relational entity ranking methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Mianwei Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Mianwei", "Hongning Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Hongning", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Kevin_Chen=Chuan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
