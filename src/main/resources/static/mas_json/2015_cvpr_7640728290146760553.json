Yet, so far we lack a theoretically sound connection to popular kernel-based learning techniques, such as kernel SVMs or kernel PCA. In this work, we establish such a connection by designing a multi-scale kernel for persistence diagrams, a stable summary representation of topological features in data. We show that this kernel is positive definite and prove its stability with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance. Experiments on two benchmark datasets for 3D shape classification/retrieval and texture recognition show considerable performance gains of the proposed method compared to an alternative approach that is based on the recently introduced persistence landscapes.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "University of Salzburg"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jan Reininghaus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reininghaus:Jan", "Stefan Huber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huber_0001:Stefan", "Ulrich Bauer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bauer:Ulrich", "Roland Kwitt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kwitt:Roland"], "pages": 8}
