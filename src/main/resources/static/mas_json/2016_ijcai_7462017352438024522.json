{"title": "Robust Natural Language Processing - Combining Reasoning, Cognitive Semantics, and Construction Grammar for Spatial Language.", "fields": ["cognitive semantics", "visual perception", "construction grammar", "robot", "spatial relation"], "abstract": "We present a system for generating and understanding of dynamic and static spatial relations in robotic interaction setups. Robots describe an environment of moving blocks using English phrases that include spatial relations such as \"across\" and \"in front of\". We evaluate the system in robot-robot interactions and show that the system can robustly deal with visual perception errors, language omissions and ungrammatical utterances.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Bremen", "University of Bremen", "Sony Computer S ... , Tokyo, Japan"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Michael Spranger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spranger:Michael", "Jakob Suchan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suchan:Jakob", "Mehul Bhatt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhatt:Mehul"], "pages": 7}
