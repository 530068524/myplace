{"title": "HTN-MAKER: Learning HTNs with Minimal Additional Knowledge Engineering Required.", "fields": ["knowledge engineering", "hierarchical task network", "decomposition method", "formalism", "convergence"], "abstract": "We describe HTN-MAKER, an algorithm for learning hierarchical planning knowledge in the form of decomposition methods for Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs). HTN-MAKER takes as input the initial states from a set of classical planning problems in a planning domain and solutions to those problems, as well as a set of semantically-annotated tasks to be accomplished. The algorithm analyzes this semantic information in order to determine which portions of the input plans accomplish a particular task and constructs HTN methods based on those analyses.\n\nOur theoretical results show that HTN-MAKER is sound and complete. We also present a formalism for a class of planning problems that are more expressive than classical planning. These planning problems can be represented as HTN planning problems. We show that the methods learned by HTN-MAKER enable an HTN planner to solve those problems. Our experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate convergence in three well-known planning domains toward a set of HTN methods that can be used to solve nearly any problem expressible as a classical planning problem in that domain, relative to a set of goals.", "citation": "Citations (92)", "departments": ["Lehigh University", "Lehigh University", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Chad Hogg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hogg:Chad", "H\u00e9ctor Mu\u00f1oz-Avila.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mu=ntilde=oz=Avila:H=eacute=ctor", "Ugur Kuter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuter:Ugur"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 7}
