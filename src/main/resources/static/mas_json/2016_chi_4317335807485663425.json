{"title": "Sensation: Measuring the Effects of a Human-to-Human Social Touch Based Controller on the Player Experience.", "fields": ["video game design", "game mechanics", "controller", "game design", "sensation"], "abstract": "We observe an increasing interest on usage of full-body interaction in games. However, human-to-human social touch interaction has not been implemented as a sophisticated gaming apparatus. To address this, we designed the Sensation, a device for detecting touch patterns between players, and introduce the game, Shape Destroy, which is a collaborative game designed to be played with social touch. To understand if usage of social touch has a meaningful contribution to the overall player experience in collaborative games we conducted a user study with 30 participants. Participants played the same game using i) the Sensation and ii) a gamepad, and completed a set of questionnaires aimed at measuring the immersion levels. As a result, the collected data and our observations indicated an increase in general, shared, ludic and affective involvement with significant differences. Thus, human-to-human touch can be considered a promising control method for collaborative physical games.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Ko\u00e7 University", "Ko\u00e7 University", "Ko\u00e7 University", "Ko\u00e7 University", "Ko\u00e7 University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mert Canat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canat:Mert", "Mustafa Ozan Tezcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tezcan:Mustafa_Ozan", "Celalettin Yurdakul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yurdakul:Celalettin", "Eran Tiza.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tiza:Eran", "Bugra Can Sefercik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sefercik:Bugra_Can", "Idil Bostan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bostan:Idil", "Oguz Turan Buruk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buruk:Oguz_Turan", "Tilbe G\u00f6ksun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=ouml=ksun:Tilbe", "Oguzhan \u00d6zcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ouml=zcan:Oguzhan"], "pages": 12}
