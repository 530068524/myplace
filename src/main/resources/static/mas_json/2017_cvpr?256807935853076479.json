{"title": "Template Matching with Deformable Diversity Similarity.", "fields": ["robustness", "template matching", "clutter", "computational complexity theory", "similarity measure"], "abstract": "We propose a novel measure for template matching named Deformable Diversity Similarity \u2013 based on the diversity of feature matches between a target image window and the template. We rely on both local appearance and geometric information that jointly lead to a powerful approach for matching. Our key contribution is a similarity measure, that is robust to complex deformations, significant background clutter, and occlusions. Empirical evaluation on the most up-to-date benchmark shows that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in its detection accuracy while improving computational complexity.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Itamar Talmi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Talmi:Itamar", "Roey Mechrez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mechrez:Roey", "Lihi Zelnik-Manor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zelnik=Manor:Lihi"], "pages": 9}
