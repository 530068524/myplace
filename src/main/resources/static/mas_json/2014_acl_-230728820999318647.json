{"title": "Response-based Learning for Grounded Machine Translation.", "fields": ["reachability problem", "machine translation", "parsing", "structured prediction", "active learning"], "abstract": "We propose a novel learning approach for statistical machine translation (SMT) that allows to extract supervision signals for structured learning from an extrinsic response to a translation input. We show how to generate responses by grounding SMT in the task of executing a semantic parse of a translated query against a database. Experiments on the GEOQUERY database show an improvement of about 6 points in F1-score for responsebased learning over learning from references only on returning the correct answer from a semantic parse of a translated query. In general, our approach alleviates the dependency on human reference translations and solves the reachability problem in structured learning for SMT.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University", "Heidelberg University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Stefan Riezler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riezler:Stefan", "Patrick Simianer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simianer:Patrick", "Carolin Haas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haas:Carolin"], "pages": 11}
