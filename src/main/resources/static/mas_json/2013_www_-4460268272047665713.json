{"title": "Accountable key infrastructure (AKI): a proposal for a public-key validation infrastructure.", "fields": ["public key infrastructure", "certificate authority", "compromise", "public key cryptography", "web of trust"], "abstract": "Recent trends in public-key infrastructure research explore the tradeoff between decreased trust in Certificate Authorities (CAs), resilience against attacks, communication overhead (bandwidth and latency) for setting up an SSL/TLS connection, and availability with respect to verifiability of public key information. In this paper, we propose AKI as a new public-key validation infrastructure, to reduce the level of trust in CAs. AKI integrates an architecture for key revocation of all entities (e.g., CAs, domains) with an architecture for accountability of all infrastructure parties through checks-and-balances. AKI efficiently handles common certification operations, and gracefully handles catastrophic events such as domain key loss or compromise. We propose AKI to make progress towards a public-key validation infrastructure with key revocation that reduces trust in any single entity.", "citation": "Citations (110)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Tiffany Hyun-Jin Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Tiffany_Hyun=Jin", "Lin-Shung Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Lin=Shung", "Adrian Perrig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Perrig:Adrian", "Collin Jackson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jackson:Collin", "Virgil D.
