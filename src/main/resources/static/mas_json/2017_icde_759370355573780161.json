{"title": "Capturing the Moment: Lightweight Similarity Computations.", "fields": ["time complexity", "popularity", "swift", "computation", "low latency"], "abstract": "Similarity computations are crucial in various web activities like advertisements, search or trust-distrust predictions. These similarities often vary with time as product perception and popularity constantly change with users' evolving inclination. The huge volume of user-generated data typically results in heavyweight computations for even a single similarity update. We present I-SIM, a novel similarity metric that enables lightweight similarity computations in an incremental and temporal manner. Incrementality enables updates with low latency whereas temporality captures users' evolving inclination. The main idea behind I-SIM is to disintegrate the similarity metric into mutually independent time-aware factors which can be updated incrementally. We illustrate the efficacy of I-SIM through a novel recommender (SWIFT) as well as through a trust-distrust predictor in Online Social Networks (I-TRUST). We experimentally show that I-SIM enables fast and accurate predictions in an energy-efficient manner.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Georgios Damaskinos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damaskinos:Georgios", "Rachid Guerraoui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guerraoui:Rachid", "Rhicheek Patra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patra:Rhicheek"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
