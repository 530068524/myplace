The first contribution is a new challenging dataset, called BelgaLogos, which was created in collaboration with professionals of a press agency, in order to evaluate logo retrieval technologies in real-world scenarios. The second and main contribution is a new visual query expansion method using an a contrario thresholding strategy in order to improve the accuracy of expanded query images. Whereas previous methods based on the same paradigm used a purely hand tuned fixed threshold, we provide a fully adaptive method enhancing both genericity and effectiveness. This new technique is evaluated on both OxfordBuilding dataset and our new BelgaLogos dataset.", "citation": "Citations (141)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "INA, Bry sur Marne, France"], "authors": ["Alexis Joly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joly:Alexis", "Olivier Buisson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buisson:Olivier"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
