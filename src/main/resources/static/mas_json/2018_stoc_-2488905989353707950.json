We present the first example that Wolfe\u2019s method takes exponential time. Additionally, we improve previous results to show that linear programming reduces in strongly-polynomial time to the minimum norm point problem over a simplex", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis", "University of California, Davis"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Jes\u00fas A.
