The effectiveness of beta testing depends on how well beta testers represent the common game-application users and if users are willing to participate in the beta test. An automated testing tool framework could reduce the dependence upon beta testing by most companies to analyze their game applications. This paper presents the Crushinator as one such framework. This framework provides a game-independent testing tool that implements multiple testing methods that can assist and possibly replace the use of beta testing.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["North Dakota State University", "North Dakota State University", "North Dakota State University"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Christopher Schaefer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaefer:Christopher", "Hyunsook Do.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Do:Hyunsook", "Brian M.
