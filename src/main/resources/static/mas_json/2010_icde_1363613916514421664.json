Through the derivation of sufficient boundary, we show that data items ranked lower than sufficient boundary are not required for answering the probabilistic top-k queries, thus are subject to local pruning. Accordingly, we develop the sufficient set-based (SSB) algorithm for inter-cluster query processing. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm reduces data transmissions significantly.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Mao Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye_0002:Mao", "Xingjie Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Xingjie", "Wang-Chien Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wang=Chien", "Dik Lun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Dik_Lun"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
