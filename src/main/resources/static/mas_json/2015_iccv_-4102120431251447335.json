Our network takes an image and 3D pose as inputs and outputs a score value, which is high when the image-pose pair matches and low otherwise. The network structure consists of a convolutional neural network for image feature extraction, followed by two sub-networks for transforming the image features and pose into a joint embedding. The score function is then the dot-product between the image and pose embeddings. The image-pose embedding and score function are jointly trained using a maximum-margin cost function. Our proposed framework can be interpreted as a special form of structured support vector machines where the joint feature space is discriminatively learned using deep neural networks. We test our framework on the Human3.6m dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results compared to other recent methods. Finally, we present visualizations of the image-pose embedding space, demonstrating the network has learned a high-level embedding of body-orientation and pose-configuration.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Sijin Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Sijin", "Weichen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Weichen", "Antoni B.
