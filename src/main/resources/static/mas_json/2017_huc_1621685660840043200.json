This project aims to enhance our perception of how contemporary human-machine interfaces encourage and produce very particular body postures and gestures, which in turn shape behavior that becomes an automatic response. Keybod is a computer keyboard worn on the upper body that forces the wearer to be mindful of typing as well as their posture. Click-kick are shoe covers that work as a computer's mouse with existing energetic movements controlling its cursor. Text-neck is a collar piece that disrupts its wearer, helping them to avoid staying in a bad posture longer than desired when interacting with a smartphone.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["The New School"], "authors": ["Nitcha Tothong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tothong:Nitcha"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
