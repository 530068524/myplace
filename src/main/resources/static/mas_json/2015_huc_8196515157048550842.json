Their growing popularity and widespread adoption present an opportunity for the design of new interventions to improve wellness and health. However, there is an increasing concern that these technologies are failing to inspire long-term adoption. In order to understand why users abandon personal health-tracking technologies, we analyzed advertisements of secondary sales of such technologies on Craigslist. We conducted iterative inductive and deductive analyses of approximately 1600 advertisements of personal health-tracking technologies posted over the course of one month across the US. We identify health motivations and rationales for abandonment and present a set of design implications. We call for improved theories that help translate between existing theories designed to explain psychological effects of health behavior change and the technologies that help people make those changes.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "University of Washington", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["James Clawson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clawson:James", "Jessica Annette Pater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pater:Jessica_Annette", "Andrew D.
