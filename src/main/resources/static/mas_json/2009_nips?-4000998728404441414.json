{"title": "Boosting with Spatial Regularization.", "fields": ["voxel", "common spatial pattern", "discriminative model", "gradient boosting", "brownboost"], "abstract": "By adding a spatial regularization kernel to a standard loss function formulation of the boosting problem, we develop a framework for spatially informed boosting. From this regularized loss framework we derive an efficient boosting algorithm that uses additional weights/priors on the base classifiers. We prove that the proposed algorithm exhibits a \"grouping effect\", which encourages the selection of all spatially local, discriminative base classifiers. The algorithm's primary advantage is in applications where the trained classifier is used to identify the spatial pattern of discriminative information, e.g. the voxel selection problem in fMRI. We demonstrate the algorithm's performance on various data sets.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Zhen James Xiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiang:Zhen_James", "Yongxin Taylor Xi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xi:Yongxin_Taylor", "Uri Hasson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasson:Uri", "Peter J.
