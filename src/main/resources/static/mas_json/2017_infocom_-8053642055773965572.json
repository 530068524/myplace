In this paper, we focus on minimizing the total number of Virtual Network Function (VNF) instances to provide a specific service (possibly at different locations) to all the flows in a network. Certain network security and analytics applications may allow fractional processing of a flow at different nodes (corresponding to datacenters), giving an opportunity for greater optimization of resources. Through a reduction from the set cover problem, we show that this problem is NP-hard and cannot even be approximated within a factor of (1 \u2212 o(1))lnm (where m is the number of flows) unless P=NP. Then, we design two simple greedy algorithms and prove that they achieve an approximation ratio of (1 \u2212 o(1))ln m + 2, which is asymptotically optimal. For special cases where each node hosts multiple VNF instances (which is typically true in practice), we also show that our greedy algorithms have a constant approximation ratio. Further, for tree topologies we develop an optimal greedy algorithm by exploiting the inherent topological structure. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms in various scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Temple University", "Temple University", "Temple University", "Temple University", "Harbin Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yu Sang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sang:Yu", "Bo Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Bo", "Gagan Raj Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Gagan_Raj", "Xiaojiang Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Xiaojiang", "Lin Ye.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Ye:Lin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
