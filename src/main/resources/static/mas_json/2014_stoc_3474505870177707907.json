Let  n  be the total number of vertices, edges and faces of the surface. Our algorithm can be used to compute  L  1  and  L  \u221e  shortest paths on a polyhedral surface in  O ( n  2  log 4   n ) time. Given an  e  \u2208 (0, 1), our algorithm can find (1 +  e )-approximate shortest paths on a terrain with gradient constraints and under cost functions that are linear combinations of path length and total ascent. The running time is  O [EQUATION]. This is the first efficient PTAS for such a general setting of terrain navigation.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Google"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Siu-Wing Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Siu=Wing", "Jiongxin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Jiongxin"], "pages": 10}
