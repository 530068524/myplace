The dependencies are represented by sets of features co-occurring with high probability and are called co-ocsets. Sparse high dimensional descriptors, such as bag of words, have been proven very effective in the domain of image retrieval. To maintain high efficiency even for very large data collection, features are assumed independent. We show experimentally that co-ocsets are not rare, i.e. the independence assumption is often violated, and that they may ruin retrieval performance if present in the query image. Two methods for managing co-ocsets in such cases are proposed. Both methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in image retrieval, one is also significantly faster.", "citation": "Citations (91)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Czech Technical University in Prague", "Czech Technical University in Prague"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ondrej Chum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chum:Ondrej", "Jiri Matas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matas:Jiri"], "pages": 8}
