However, this is an extremely challenging task as it requires to disentangle intrinsic physical properties of an image. We propose an end-to-end network architecture that replicates the forward image formation process to accomplish this task. Specifically, given a single image, the network first predicts intrinsic properties, i.e. shape, illumination, and material, which are then provided to a rendering layer. This layer performs in-network image synthesis, thereby enabling the network to understand the physics behind the image formation process. The proposed rendering layer is fully differentiable, supports both diffuse and specular materials, and thus can be applicable in a variety of problem settings. We demonstrate a rich set of visually plausible material editing examples and provide an extensive comparative study.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["George Mason University", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "George Mason University", "George Mason University", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "George Mason University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Guilin Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Guilin", "Duygu Ceylan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceylan:Duygu", "Ersin Yumer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yumer:Ersin", "Jimei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Jimei", "Jyh-Ming Lien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lien:Jyh=Ming"], "pages": 9}
