{"title": "The Effects of Sequence and Delay on Crowd Work.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "real time computing", "workflow", "computer science", "slowdown"], "abstract": "A common approach in crowdsourcing is to break large tasks into small microtasks so that they can be parallelized across many crowd workers and so that redundant work can be more easily compared for quality control. In practice, this can result in the microtasks being presented out of their natural order and often introduces delays between individual microtasks. In this paper, we demonstrate in a study of 338 crowd workers that non-sequential microtasks and the introduction of delays significantly decreases worker performance. We show that interruptions where a large delay occurs between two related tasks can cause up to a 102% slowdown in completion time, and interruptions where workers are asked to perform different tasks in sequence can slow down completion time by 57%. We conclude with a set of design guidelines to improve both worker performance and realized pay, and instructions for implementing these changes in existing interfaces for crowd work.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Rochester", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Locu, Boston, MA, USA"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Walter S.
