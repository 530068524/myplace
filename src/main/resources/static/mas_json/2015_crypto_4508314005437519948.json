{"title": "Explicit Non-malleable Codes Against Bit-Wise Tampering and Permutations.", "fields": ["code word", "concatenated error correction code", "code", "commitment scheme", "bitwise operation"], "abstract": "A non-malleable code protects messages against various classes of tampering. Informally, a code is non-malleable if the message contained in a tampered codeword is either the original message, or a completely unrelated one. Although existence of such codes for various rich classes of tampering functions is known, explicit constructions exist only for \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d tampering functions: i.e. the codeword is partitioned into a priori fixed blocks and each block can only be tampered independently. The prominent examples of this model are the family of bit-wise independent tampering functions and the split-state model.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "Purdue University", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Shashank Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Shashank", "Divya Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta_0001:Divya", "Hemanta K.
