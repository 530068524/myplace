As a result, generating the appropriate descriptions of images with both diversity and high quality is of great importance. In this paper, we propose a framework called GroupTalk to learn multiple image caption distributions simultaneously and effectively mimic the diversity of the image captions written by human beings. In particular, a novel iterative update strategy is proposed to separate training sentence samples into groups and learn their distributions at the same time. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient classifier to solve the problem brought about by the non-linear and discontinuous nature of language distributions which will impair performance. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that GroupTalk naturally diversifies the generated captions of each image without sacrificing the accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Zhuhao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zhuhao", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Weiming Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Weiming", "Jun Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao_0001:Jun", "Xi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Xi", "Zitong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zitong", "Yueting Zhuang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuang:Yueting"], "pages": 8}
