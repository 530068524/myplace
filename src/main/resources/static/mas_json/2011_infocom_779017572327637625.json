In order to keep up with the ever-higher line speed, recent research trend is to implement scan detection in fast but small SRAM. This leads to a difficult technical challenge because the amount of traffic to be monitored is huge but the on-die memory space for performing such a monitoring task is very limited. We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds. Experiments based on a real Internet traffic trace demonstrate that the proposed scan detection scheme reduces memory consumption by three to twenty times when comparing with the best existing work.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida", "University of Florida"], "authors": ["Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0013:Tao", "Shigang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Shigang", "Wen Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Wen", "Ming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Ming"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
