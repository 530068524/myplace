Our analysis explores four characteristics that players articulated about their virtual intimate experiences: the permeability of intimacy across virtual and real worlds, the mundane as the origin of intimacy, the significance of reciprocity and exchange, and the formative role of temporality in shaping understandings and recollections of intimate experiences. We also consider the manifest ways that WoW's software features support and encourage these characteristics.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "authors": ["Tyler Pace.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pace:Tyler", "Shaowen Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Shaowen", "Jeffrey Bardzell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bardzell:Jeffrey"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
