The laws of stochastic processes are embedded into the space of maximal elements of the normalised probabilistic power domain on the space of continuous interval-valued functions endowed with the relative Scott topology. We use the resulting  \u03c9 -continuous bounded complete dcpo to define partial stochastic processes and characterise their computability. For a given continuous stochastic process, we show how its domain-theoretic, i.e., finitary, approximations can be constructed, whose least upper bound is the law of the stochastic process. As a main result, we apply our methodology to Brownian motion. We construct a partial Wiener measure and show that the Wiener measure is computable within the domain-theoretic framework.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Imperial College London", "Imperial College London"], "authors": ["Paul Bilokon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bilokon:Paul", "Abbas Edalat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Edalat:Abbas"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
