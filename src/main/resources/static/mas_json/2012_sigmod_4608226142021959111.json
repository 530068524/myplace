While many XML editors exist in the market, we argue that some important functionalities are missing in all of them. Our goal is to makes the editing task simpler and faster. We present ALEX (Auto-completion Learning Editor for XML), an editor that assists the users by providing intelligent auto-completion suggestions. These suggestions are adapted to the user needs, simply by feeding ALEX with a set of example XML documents to learn from. The suggestions are also guaranteed to be compliant with a given XML schema, possibly including integrity constraints. To fulfill this challenging goal, we rely on novel, theoretical foundations by us and others, which are combined here in a system for the first time.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Coll\u00e8ge de France", "Tel Aviv University", "Tel Aviv University", "T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Serge Abiteboul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abiteboul:Serge", "Yael Amsterdamer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amsterdamer:Yael", "Tova Milo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Milo:Tova", "Pierre Senellart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Senellart:Pierre"], "pages": 4}
