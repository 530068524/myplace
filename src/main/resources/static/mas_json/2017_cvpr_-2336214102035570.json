In this paper we introduce a novel rank constraint on collections of fundamental matrices in multi-view settings. We show that in general, with the selection of proper scale factors, a matrix formed by stacking fundamental matrices between pairs of images has rank 6. Moreover, this matrix forms the symmetric part of a rank 3 matrix whose factors relate directly to the corresponding camera matrices. We use this new characterization to produce better estimations of fundamental matrices by optimizing an L1-cost function using Iterative Re-weighted Least Squares and Alternate Direction Method of Multiplier. We further show that this procedure can improve the recovery of camera locations, particularly in multi-view settings in which fewer images are available.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Soumyadip Sengupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sengupta:Soumyadip", "Tal Amir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amir:Tal", "Meirav Galun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Galun:Meirav", "Tom Goldstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldstein:Tom", "David W.
