While remarkably high accuracies are achievable, state-of-the-art methods suffer from two distinct weaknesses: First, for mainly constructive reasons, these can only capture a few square centimeters of surface area at once. Second, reconstructions are ambiguous i.e. infinitely many surfaces lead to the same visual impression. We resolve both of these problems by introducing the first multiview specular stereo approach, which jointly evaluates a series of overlapping deflectometric images. Two publicly available benchmarks accompany this paper, enabling us to numerically demonstrate viability and practicability of our approach.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Fraunhofer Society"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jonathan Balzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balzer:Jonathan", "Sebastian H\u00f6fer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=fer:Sebastian", "J\u00fcrgen Beyerer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Beyerer:J=uuml=rgen"], "pages": 8}
