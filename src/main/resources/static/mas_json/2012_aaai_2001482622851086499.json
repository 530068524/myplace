We theoretically analyze tradeoffs between the expectation and variance of the principal's utility (i.e. the best solution's quality), and empirically test our theoretical predictions using a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our evaluation method is also crowdsourcing based and relies on the peer prediction mechanism. Our theoretical analysis shows an expectation-variance tradeoff of the principal's utility in such contests through a Pareto efficient frontier. In particular, we show that the simple contest with 2 authors and the 2-pair contest have good theoretical properties. In contrast, our empirical results show that the 2-pair contest is the superior design among all designs tested, achieving the highest expectation and lowest variance of the principal's utility.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Xi Alice Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Xi_Alice", "Yoram Bachrach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bachrach:Yoram", "Peter Key.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Key:Peter", "Thore Graepel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Graepel:Thore"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
