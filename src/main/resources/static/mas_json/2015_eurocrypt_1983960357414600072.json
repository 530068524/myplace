{"title": "Cube Attacks and Cube-Attack-Like Cryptanalysis on the Round-Reduced Keccak Sponge Function.", "fields": ["sponge function", "cube", "key recovery attack", "cryptanalysis", "sha 3", "cube attack", "discrete mathematics"], "abstract": "In this paper, we comprehensively study the resistance of keyed variants of SHA-3 (Keccak) against algebraic attacks. This analysis covers a wide range of key recovery, MAC forgery and other types of attacks, breaking up to 9 rounds (out of the full 24) of the Keccak internal permutation much faster than exhaustive search. Moreover, some of our attacks on the 6-round Keccak are completely practical and were verified on a desktop PC. Our methods combine cube attacks (an algebraic key recovery attack) and related algebraic techniques with structural analysis of the Keccak permutation. These techniques should be useful in future cryptanalysis of Keccak and similar designs.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Polish Academy of Sciences", "Queensland University of Technology", "Polish Academy of Sciences", "University of Commerce"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Itai Dinur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinur:Itai", "Pawel Morawiecki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morawiecki:Pawel", "Josef Pieprzyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pieprzyk:Josef", "Marian Srebrny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srebrny:Marian", "Michal Straus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Straus:Michal"], "pages": 29}
