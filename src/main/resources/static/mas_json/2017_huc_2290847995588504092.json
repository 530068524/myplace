In fact, we have few opportunities to look back own browsing way. Even if we check the enormous browsing logs, it is hard to convert them into sharable knowledge. Therefore, our tool measure the dwell time, the amount of scrolling and page contents and transition between pages for evaluating the importance of each page. In addition, our tool provides an editing function to summarize a thought process based on the importance of each page.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Kazuma Nagano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagano:Kazuma", "Yutaka Arakawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arakawa:Yutaka", "Keiichi Yasumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yasumoto:Keiichi"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
