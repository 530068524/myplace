{"title": "Polynomial Datalog Rewritings for Expressive Description Logics with Closed Predicates.", "fields": ["datalog", "predicate", "monotonic function", "description logic", "negation as failure"], "abstract": "We consider instance queries mediated by an ontology expressed in the expressive DL ALCHIO with closed predicates. We observe that such queries are non-monotonic and cannot be expressed in monotonic variants of DATALOG, but a polynomial time translation into disjunctive DATALOG extended with negation as failure is feasible. If no closed predicates are present-in the case of classical instance checking in ALCHIO-our translation yields a positive disjunctive DATALOG program of polynomial size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first polynomial time translation of an expressive (non-Horn) DL into disjunctive DATALOG.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Institute of In ... ienna, Austria", "Institute of In ... ienna, Austria", "Institute of In ... ienna, Austria"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Shqiponja Ahmetaj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ahmetaj:Shqiponja", "Magdalena Ortiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ortiz:Magdalena", "Mantas Simkus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Simkus:Mantas"], "pages": 8}
