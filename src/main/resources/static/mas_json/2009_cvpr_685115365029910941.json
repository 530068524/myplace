{"title": "A stereo approach that handles the matting problem via image warping.", "fields": ["image warping", "computational geometry", "left and right", "stereopsis", "pixel"], "abstract": "We propose an algorithm that simultaneously extracts disparities and alpha matting information given a stereo image pair. Our method divides the reference image into a set of overlapping, partially transparent color segments. Each segment pixel is assigned an alpha value and color. The disparity inside the segment is modeled via a plane. The goodness of alphas, colors and disparity planes is measured by a new energy function. Its basic idea is to use the three parameters for generating artificial views representing the left and right images. If alphas, colors and disparity planes are correct, these artificial images should be very similar to the real ones. For generating the artificial right view, we warp all pixels of the left into the geometry of the right image using the disparity planes. We introduce the assumption of constant solidity in order to correctly model how pixels' alpha values are affected by the warping operation. Experimental results on the Middlebury set show that our algorithm gives good results in comparison to the state-of-the-art in stereo matching.", "citation": "Citations (59)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Microsoft", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Michael Bleyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bleyer:Michael", "Margrit Gelautz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gelautz:Margrit", "Carsten Rother.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rother:Carsten", "Christoph Rhemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rhemann:Christoph"], "pages": 8}
