We design for this problem a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that computes a (1+\u00b5)-approximation to the optimal tour, for any fixed \u00b5>0, in TSP instances that form an arbitrary metric space with bounded intrinsic dimension.   The celebrated results of Arora [Aro98] and Mitchell [Mit99] prove that the above result holds in the special case of TSP in a fixed-dimensional Euclidean space. Thus, our algorithm demonstrates that the algorithmic tractability of metric TSP depends on the dimensionality of the space and not on its specific geometry. This result resolves a problem that has been open since the quasi-polynomial time algorithm of Talwar [Tal04].", "citation": "Citations (31)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yair Bartal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bartal:Yair", "Lee-Ad Gottlieb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottlieb:Lee=Ad", "Robert Krauthgamer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krauthgamer:Robert"], "pages": 10}
