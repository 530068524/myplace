However, in many practical implementations (such as crowdsourcing, surveys, high-throughput experimental design), it is preferable to query labels for batches of examples to be labelled in parallel. While several heuristics have been proposed for batch-mode active learning, little is known about their theoretical performance. We consider batch mode active learning and more general information-parallel stochastic optimization problems that exhibit adaptive submodularity, a natural diminishing returns condition. We prove that for such problems, a simple greedy strategy is competitive with the optimal batch-mode policy. In some cases, surprisingly, the use of batches incurs competitively low cost, even when compared to a fully sequential strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on batch-mode active learning tasks, where it outperforms the state of the art, as well as the novel problem of multi-stage influence maximization in social networks.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Yuxin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yuxin", "Andreas Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause_0001:Andreas"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
