{"title": "Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging with Bilingual Graph-Based Projections.", "fields": ["graph", "training set", "part of speech tagging", "expectation maximization algorithm", "knowledge transfer"], "abstract": "We describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. Our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages. We use graph-based label propagation for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and use the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010). Across eight European languages, our approach results in an average absolute improvement of 10.4% over a state-of-the-art baseline, and 16.7% over vanilla hidden Markov models induced with the Expectation Maximization algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (231)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Google"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Dipanjan Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das_0001:Dipanjan", "Slav Petrov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petrov:Slav"], "pages": 10}
