{"title": "Quad-Networks: Unsupervised Learning to Rank for Interest Point Detection.", "fields": ["interest point detection", "quantile", "rgb color model", "ranking", "scratch"], "abstract": "Several machine learning tasks require to represent the data using only a sparse set of interest points. An ideal detector is able to find the corresponding interest points even if the data undergo a transformation typical for a given domain. Since the task is of high practical interest in computer vision, many hand-crafted solutions were proposed. In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: can we learn such detectors from scratch? Since it is often unclear what points are interesting, human labelling cannot be used to find a truly unbiased solution. Therefore, the task requires an unsupervised formulation. We are the first to propose such a formulation: training a neural network to rank points in a transformation-invariant manner. Interest points are then extracted from the top/bottom quantiles of this ranking. We validate our approach on two tasks: standard RGB image interest point detection and challenging cross-modal interest point detection between RGB and depth images. We quantitatively show that our unsupervised method performs better or on-par with baselines.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Toshiba", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Nikolay Savinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Savinov:Nikolay", "Akihito Seki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seki:Akihito", "Lubor Ladicky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ladicky:Lubor", "Torsten Sattler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sattler:Torsten", "Marc Pollefeys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pollefeys:Marc"], "pages": 9}
