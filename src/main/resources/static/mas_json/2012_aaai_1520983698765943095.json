It has its roots in artificial intelligence, mathematical programming, operations research, and programming languages. This paper gives a perspective on where constraint programming is today, and discusses a number of opportunities and challenges that could provide focus for the research community into the future.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University College Cork"], "authors": ["Barry O'Sullivan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Sullivan:Barry"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
