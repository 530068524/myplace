It could handle thousands of sensor inputs and produce thousands of diagnostic messages with confidence factors based on complex logic designed to mimic the thinking of human experts. PDS went into commercial operation in 1985 to monitor seven power plant generators from a centralized diagnostic center at Westinghouse Power Generation headquarters. In the 1990's the popularity of advanced technology gas turbines provided a renaissance in PDS utilization. The software has undergone rewrites and improvements since its inception, and the current PCPDS now supports the Siemens Power Diagnostics\u00ae Center with centralized rule based monitoring of over 1200 gas turbines, steam turbines, and generators.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Siemens Energy Sector", "Siemens Energy Sector", "Siemens Energy Sector", "Siemens Energy Sector", "Siemens Energy Sector"], "authors": ["Edward D.
