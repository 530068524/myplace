{"title": "Block permutations in Boolean Space to minimize TCAM for packet classification.", "fields": ["network packet", "fold", "content addressable memory", "ternary operation", "logic optimization"], "abstract": "Packet classification is one of the major challenges in designing high-speed routers and firewalls as it involves sophisticated multi-dimensional searching. Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) has been widely used to implement packet classification thanks to its parallel search capability and constant processing speed. However, TCAM-based packet classification has the well-known range expansion problem, resulting in a huge waste of TCAM entries. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called Block Permutation (BP) to compress the packet classification rules stored in TCAMs. The compression is achieved by performing block-based permutations on the rules represented in Boolean Space. We develop an efficient heuristic approach to find the permutations for compression and design its hardware implementation. Experiments on ClassBench classifiers and ISP classifiers show that the proposed BP technique can reduce TCAM entries by 53.99% on average.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "authors": ["Rihua Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Rihua", "Yang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu_0010:Yang", "H.
