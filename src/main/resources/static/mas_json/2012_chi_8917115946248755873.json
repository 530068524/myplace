{"title": "\"You've got video\": increasing clickthrough when sharing enterprise video with email.", "fields": ["world wide web", "computer science", "multimedia", "thumbnail", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "In this Note we summarize our research on increasing the information scent of video recordings that are shared via email in a corporate setting. We compare two types of email messages for sharing recordings: the first containing basic information (e.g. title, speaker, abstract) with a link to the video; the second with the same information plus a set of video thumbnails (hyperlinked to the segments they represent), which are automatically created by video summarization technology. We report on the results of two user studies. The first one compares the quality of the set of thumbnails selected by the technology to sets selected by 31 humans. The second study examines the clickthrough rates for both email formats (with and without hyperlinked thumbnails) as well as gathering subjective feedback via survey. Results indicate that the email messages with the thumbnails drove significantly higher clickthrough rates than the messages without, even though people clicked on the main video link more frequently than the thumbnails. Survey responses show that users found the email with the thumbnail set significantly more appealing and novel.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Uluda\u011f University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Mercan Topkara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Topkara:Mercan", "Shimei Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Shimei", "Jennifer C.
