{"title": "G-spacing: a gyro sensor based relative 3D space positioning scheme.", "fields": ["user experience design", "virtual reality", "digital humanities", "mobile device", "compass"], "abstract": "Interaction with virtual objects among different devices attracts lots of attention recently. LuminAR [Linder and Maes] was developed for a portable and compact projector-camera system for interactive displaying. THAW [Leigh et al.] was proposed to use a back-facing camera of a smartphone to assist the interactive displaying. RealSense [Lin et al.] was adopted the built-in compass sensor on a mobile device to calibrate the relative position among different mobile devices. However, the complex calibration process of LuminAR [Linder and Maes] and THAW [Leigh et al.] limited the applications. On the other hand, as addressed by the authors, once the users with mobile devices using RealSense [Lin et al.] move larger than 15\u00b0, the positioning relationship cannot be kept stable. Therefore, in this paper, a 3D positioning scheme is proposed based on the built-in gyro sensor on a mobile device for effective and intuitive calibration and allow users to freely move the mobile devices with a natural user experience.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Taipei National University of the Arts", "Taipei National University of the Arts", "Taipei National University of the Arts", "Academia Sinica", "Taipei National University of the Arts"], "authors": ["Kai-Wen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Kai=Wen", "I-Peng Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:I=Peng", "Shih-Wei Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Shih=Wei", "Wen-Huang Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Wen=Huang", "Xiaoniu Su-Chu Hsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hsu:Xiaoniu_Su=Chu"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
