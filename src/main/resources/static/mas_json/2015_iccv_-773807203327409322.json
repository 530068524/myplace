{"title": "MANTRA: Minimum Maximum Latent Structural SVM for Image Classification and Ranking.", "fields": ["latent variable model", "contextual image classification", "discriminative model", "ranking svm", "ranking"], "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) framework dedicated to learn discriminative part detectors from images annotated with a global label. Our WSL method encompasses three main contributions. Firstly, we introduce a new structured output latent variable model, Minimum mAximum lateNt sTRucturAl SVM (MANTRA), which prediction relies on a pair of latent variables: h+ (resp. h-) provides positive (resp. negative) evidence for a given output y. Secondly, we instantiate MANTRA for two different visual recognition tasks: multi-class classification and ranking. For ranking, we propose efficient solutions to exactly solve the inference and the loss-augmented problems. Finally, extensive experiments highlight the relevance of the proposed method: MANTRA outperforms state-of-the art results on five different datasets.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Thibaut Durand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durand:Thibaut", "Nicolas Thome.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thome:Nicolas", "Matthieu Cord.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cord:Matthieu"], "pages": 9}
