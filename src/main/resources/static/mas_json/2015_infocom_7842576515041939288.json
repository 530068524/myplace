{"title": "SIEVE: Scalable user grouping for large MU-MIMO systems.", "fields": ["multi user mimo", "beamforming", "sieve", "capacity loss", "mimo"], "abstract": "Multi-user multiple input and multiple output (MU-MIMO) is one predominate approach to improve the wireless capacity. However, since the aggregate capacity of MU-MIMO heavily depends on the channel correlations among the mobile users in a beamforming group, unwisely selecting beamforming groups may result in reduced overall capacity, instead of increasing it. How to select users into a beamforming group becomes the bottleneck of realizing the MU-MIMO gain. The fundamental challenge for user selection is the large searching space, and hence there exists a tradeoff between search complexity and achievable capacity. Previous works have proposed several low complexity heuristic algorithms, but they suffer a significant capacity loss. In this paper, we present a novel MU-MIMO MAC, called SIEVE. The core of SIEVE design is its scalable multi-user selection module that provides a knob to control the aggressiveness in searching the best beamforming group. SIEVE maintains a central database to track the channel and the coherence time for each mobile user, and largely avoids unnecessary computing with a progressive update strategy. Our evaluation, via both small-scale testbed experiments and large-scale trace-driven simulations, shows that SIEVE can achieve around 90% of the capacity compared to exhaustive search.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica", "Academia Sinica", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Wei-Liang Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Wei=Liang", "Kate Ching-Ju Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Kate_Ching=Ju", "Ming-Syan Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ming=Syan", "Kun Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kun"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
