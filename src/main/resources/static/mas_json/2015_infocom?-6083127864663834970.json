In this work we analyze the discrete Ricci curvature of the Internet, defined by Ollivier [1], Lin et al. [2], etc. Ricci curvature measures whether local distances diverge or converge. It is a more local measure which allows us to understand the distribution of curvatures in the network. We show by various Internet data sets that the distribution of Ricci cuvature is spread out, suggesting the network topology to be non-homogenous. We also show that the Ricci curvature has interesting connections to both local measures such as node degree and clustering coefficient, global measures such as betweenness centrality and network connectivity, as well as auxilary attributes such as geographical distances. These observations add to the richness of geometric structures in complex network theory.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Stony Brook University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Chien-Chun Ni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ni:Chien=Chun", "Yu-Yao Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Yu=Yao", "Jie Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Jie", "Xianfeng David Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Xianfeng_David", "Emil Saucan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saucan:Emil"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
