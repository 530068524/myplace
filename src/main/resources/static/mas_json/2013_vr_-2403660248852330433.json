To transfer texture appropriately from one part of an object to another, two texture images are generated by the Least Square Conformal Map (LSCM) technique. Two regions in the texture images corresponding to source and target areas of interest are then obtained using cross-boundary brushes. Target texel values are sampled from corresponding source texels by Moving Least Squares (MLS), and are finally mapped onto the target object. In this poster, we will describe the basic idea, implementation details, and example interaction results and a preliminary user study.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Atsushi Umakatsu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Umakatsu:Atsushi", "Tomohiro Mashita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mashita:Tomohiro", "Kiyoshi Kiyokawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiyokawa:Kiyoshi", "Haruo Takemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takemura:Haruo"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
