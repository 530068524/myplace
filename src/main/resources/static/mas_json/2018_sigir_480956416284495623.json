{"title": "Split-Lists and Initial Thresholds for WAND-based Search.", "fields": ["information retrieval", "computer science", "search engine"], "abstract": "We examine search engine performance for rank-safe query execution using the WAND and state-of-the-art BMW algorithms. Supported by extensive experiments, we suggest two approaches to improve query performance: initial list thresholds should be used when k values are large, and our split-list WAND approach should be used instead of the normal WAND or BMW approaches. We also recommend that reranking-based distributed systems use smaller k values when selecting the results to return from each partition.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Waterloo", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Andrew Kane.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kane:Andrew", "Frank Wm.
