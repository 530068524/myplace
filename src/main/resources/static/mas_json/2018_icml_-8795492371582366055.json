{"title": "Improved Training of Generative Adversarial Networks using Representative Features.", "fields": ["discriminator", "machine learning", "generative grammar", "learning curve", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "Despite of the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation tasks, the trade-off between image diversity and visual quality are an well-known issue. Conventional techniques achieve either visual quality or image diversity; the improvement in one side is often the result of sacrificing the degradation in the other side. In this paper, we aim to achieve both simultaneously by improving the stability of training GANs. A key idea of the proposed approach is to implicitly regularizing the discriminator using a representative feature. For that, this representative feature is extracted from the data distribution, and then transferred to the discriminator for enforcing slow updates of the gradient. Consequently, the entire training process is stabilized because the learning curve of discriminator varies slowly. Based on extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach improves the visual quality and diversity of state-of-the art GANs.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Yonsei University", "Yonsei University"], "authors": ["Duhyeon Bang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bang:Duhyeon", "Hyunjung Shim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shim:Hyunjung"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
