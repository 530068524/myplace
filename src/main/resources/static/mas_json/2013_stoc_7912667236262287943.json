Given 0 1/2+e  + HD), where n is the number of nodes and HD denotes the diameter of the network in hops (i.e., as if the network is unweighted). The weighted length of the produced routes is at most O(e -1 log e -1 ) times the optimal weighted length. This is the first algorithm to break the Omega(n) complexity barrier for computing weighted shortest paths even for a single source. Moreover, the algorithm nearly meets the ~Omega(n 1/2  + HD) lower bound for distributed computation of routing tables and approximate distances (with optimality, up to polylog factors, for e=1/log n). The presented techniques have many applications, including improved distributed approximation algorithms for Generalized Steiner Forest, all-pairs distance estimation, and estimation of the weighted diameter.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Tel Aviv University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Christoph Lenzen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lenzen:Christoph", "Boaz Patt-Shamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patt=Shamir:Boaz"], "pages": 10}
