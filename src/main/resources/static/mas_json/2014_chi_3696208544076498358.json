The projection is created behind the upright standing phone and is touch and gesture-enabled. Multiple projections can be merged to create shared spaces for multi-user collaboration. We investigate this new setup, starting with the concept that we evaluated with a concept prototype. Furthermore we present our technical prototype, a mobile phone case with integrated projector that allows for the aforementioned interaction. We discuss its technical requirements and evaluate the accuracy of interaction in a second user study. We conclude with lessons learned and design guidelines.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Ulm", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "University of Ulm", "German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Christian Winkler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Winkler:Christian", "Markus L\u00f6chtefeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=ouml=chtefeld:Markus", "David Dobbelstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobbelstein:David", "Antonio Kr\u00fcger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=uuml=ger:Antonio", "Enrico Rukzio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rukzio:Enrico"], "pages": 10}
