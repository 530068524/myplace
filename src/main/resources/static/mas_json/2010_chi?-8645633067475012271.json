{"title": "Push-and-pull switching: window switching based on window overlapping.", "fields": ["computer hardware", "real time computing", "computer science", "window manager"], "abstract": "We propose Push-and-Pull Switching, a window switching technique using window overlapping to implicitly define groups. Push-and-Pull Switching enables switching between groups and restacking the focused window to any position to change its group membership. The technique was evaluated in an experiment which found that Push-and-Pull Switching improves switching performance by more than 50% compared to other switching techniques in different scenarios. A longitudinal user study indicates that participants invoked this switching technique 15% of the time on single monitor displays and that they found it easy to understand and use.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["university of lille", "university of lille"], "authors": ["Quan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Quan", "G\u00e9ry Casiez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Casiez:G=eacute=ry"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
