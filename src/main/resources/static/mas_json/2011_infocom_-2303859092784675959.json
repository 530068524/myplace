{"title": "A dynamic game solution to malware attack.", "fields": ["malware", "saddle point", "game theory", "sequential game", "saddle"], "abstract": "Given the flexibility that software-based operation provides, it is unreasonable to expect that new malware will demonstrate a fixed behavior over time. Instead, malware can dynamically change the parameters of their infective hosts in response to the dynamics of the network, in order to maximize their overall damage. However, in return, the network can also dynamically change its counter-measure parameters in order to attain a robust defense against the spread of malware while minimally affecting the normal performance of the network. The infinite dimension of freedom introduced by variation over time and antagonistic and strategic optimization of malware and network against each other demand new attempts for modeling and analysis. We develop a zero-sum dynamic game model and investigate the structural properties of the saddle-point strategies. We specifically show that saddle-point strategies are simple threshold-based policies and hence, a robust dynamic defense is practicable.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["M.
