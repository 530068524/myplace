The system has an associative memory based on complex-valued vectors and is closely related to Holographic Reduced Representations and Long Short-Term Memory networks. Holographic Reduced Representations have limited capacity: as they store more information, each retrieval becomes noisier due to interference. Our system in contrast creates redundant copies of stored information, which enables retrieval with reduced noise. Experiments demonstrate faster learning on multiple memorization tasks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "DEEPMIND TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Ivo Danihelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danihelka:Ivo", "Greg Wayne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wayne:Greg", "Benigno Uria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Uria:Benigno", "Nal Kalchbrenner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalchbrenner:Nal", "Alex Graves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Graves:Alex"], "pages": 9}
