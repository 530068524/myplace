{"title": "Lower and Upper Bounds for SPARQL Queries over OWL Ontologies.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "spatial query", "sparql", "database", "sargable", "web query classification", "ontology", "computer science"], "abstract": "The paper presents an approach for optimizing the evaluation of SPARQL queries over OWL ontologies using SPARQL's OWL Direct Semantics entailment regime. The approach is based on the computation of lower and upper bounds, but we allow for much more expressive queries than related approaches. In order to optimize the evaluation of possible query answers in the upper but not in the lower bound, we present a query extension approach that uses schema knowledge from the queried ontology to extend the query with additional parts. We show that the resulting query is equivalent to the original one and we use the additional parts that are simple to evaluate for restricting the bounds of subqueries of the initial query. In an empirical evaluation we show that the proposed query extension approach can lead to a significant decrease in the query execution time of up to four orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "National Technical University of Athens", "National Technical University of Athens"], "authors": ["Birte Glimm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glimm:Birte", "Yevgeny Kazakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazakov:Yevgeny", "Ilianna Kollia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kollia:Ilianna", "Giorgos B.
