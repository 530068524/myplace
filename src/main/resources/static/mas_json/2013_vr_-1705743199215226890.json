Tracking technologies such as the Microsoft Kinect and emerging multi-touch interfaces enable inexpensive and low-maintenance interactive setups while providing portable solutions for engaging presentations and exhibitions. In this poster we describe an extension of the smARTbox, which is a responsive touch-enabled stereoscopic out-of-the-box technology for interactive setups. We extended the smARTbox by making the entire setup portable, which provides a new interaction experience, when exploring 3D data sets. The portable tracked multi-touch interface supports two different interaction paradigms: exploration by multi-touch gestures as well a s exploration by lateral movements of the entire setup. Hence, typical gestures supporting rotation and panning can be implemented via multi-touch gestures, but also via actual movements of the setup.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of W\u00fcrzburg", "University of W\u00fcrzburg", "University of W\u00fcrzburg", "University of W\u00fcrzburg"], "authors": ["David Cyborra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cyborra:David", "Moritz Albert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albert:Moritz", "Frank Steinicke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Steinicke:Frank", "Gerd Bruder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bruder:Gerd"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
