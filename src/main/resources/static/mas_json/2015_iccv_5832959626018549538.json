{"title": "Complementary Sets of Shutter Sequences for Motion Deblurring.", "fields": ["shutter", "spatial frequency", "communication theory", "deblurring", "binary number"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel multi-image motion deblurring method utilizing the coded exposure technique. The key idea of our work is to capture video frames with a set of complementary fluttering patterns to preserve spatial frequency details. We introduce an algorithm for generating a complementary set of binary sequences based on the modern communication theory and implement the coded exposure video system with an off-the-shelf machine vision camera. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on various challenging examples with quantitative and qualitative comparisons to other computational image capturing methods used for image deblurring.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST", "Yonsei University", "KAIST"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Hae-Gon Jeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeon:Hae=Gon", "Joon-Young Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Joon=Young", "Yudeog Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Yudeog", "Seon Joo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Seon_Joo", "In-So Kweon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kweon:In=So"], "pages": 9}
