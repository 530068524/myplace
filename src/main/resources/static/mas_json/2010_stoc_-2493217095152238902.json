We consider a problem with a set B of buyers and a set G of divisible goods. Each buyer i starts with an initial integral allocation e i  of money. The integral utility for buyer i of good j is U ij . We first develop a weakly polynomial time algorithm that runs in O(n 4  log U max  + n 3  e max ) time, where n = |B| + |G|. We further modify the algorithm so that it runs in O(n 4  log n) time. These algorithms improve upon the previous best running time of O(n 8  log U max  + n 7  log e max ), due to Devanur et al.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["James B.
