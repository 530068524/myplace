We propose a totally unsupervised solution to this problem. No a-priori model of the actions is assumed to be available. The number of common sub-sequences may be unknown. The sub-sequences can be located anywhere in the original sequences, may differ in duration and the corresponding actions may be performed by a different person, in different style. We treat this type of temporal action co-segmentation as a stochastic optimization problem that is solved by employing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The objective function that is minimized by PSO capitalizes on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compare two action sub-sequences. Due to the generic problem formulation and solution, the proposed method can be applied to motion capture (i.e., 3D skeletal) data or to conventional RGB videos acquired in the wild. We present extensive quantitative experiments on standard data sets as well as on data sets we introduced in this paper. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a remarkable increase in co-segmentation quality compared to all tested state of the art methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Foundation for Research & Technology \u2013 Hellas", "Foundation for Research & Technology \u2013 Hellas", "Foundation for Research & Technology \u2013 Hellas"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Konstantinos E.
