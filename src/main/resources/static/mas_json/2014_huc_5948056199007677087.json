We designed and developed SensoryPaint, a multimodal system that allows users to paint on a large display using physical objects, body-based interactions, and interactive audio. We evaluated the impact of SensoryPaint through two user studies: a lab-based study of 15 children with neurodevelopmental disorders in which they used the system for up to one hour, and a deployment study with four children with autism, during which the system was integrated into existing daily sensory therapy sessions. Our results demonstrate that a multimodal large display, using whole body interactions combined with tangible interactions and interactive audio feedback, balances children's attention between their own bodies and sensory stimuli, augments existing therapies, and promotes socialization. These results offer implications for the design of other ubicomp systems for children with neurodevelopmental disorders and for their integration into therapeutic interventions.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education", "University of California, Irvine", "Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education", "Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education"], "authors": ["Kathryn E.
