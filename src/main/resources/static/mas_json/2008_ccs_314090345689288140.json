In this paper we present a novel trust management paradigm for securing pan-organisational information flows that aims to address the threat of information leakage. Our trust management system is built around an economic model and a trust-based encryption primitive wherein: (i) entities purchase a key from a Trust Authority (TA) which is bound to a voluntarily reported trust score r, (ii) information flows are encrypted such that a flow tagged with a recipient trust score R can be decrypted by the recipient only if it possesses the key corresponding to a voluntarily reported score r", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["IBM", "Royal Holloway, University of London", "Royal Holloway, University of London", "IBM"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Mudhakar Srivatsa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivatsa:Mudhakar", "Shane Balfe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balfe:Shane", "Kenneth G.
