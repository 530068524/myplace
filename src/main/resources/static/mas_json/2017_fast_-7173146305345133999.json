{"title": "Redundancy Does Not Imply Fault Tolerance: Analysis of Distributed Storage Reactions to Single Errors and Corruptions.", "fields": ["distributed data store", "unavailability", "redundancy", "data loss", "cloud storage"], "abstract": "We analyze how modern distributed storage systems behave in the presence of file-system faults such as data corruption and read and write errors. We characterize eight popular distributed storage systems and uncover numerous bugs related to file-system fault tolerance. We find that modern distributed systems do not consistently use redundancy to recover from file-system faults: a single file-system fault can cause catastrophic outcomes such as data loss, corruption, and unavailability. Our results have implications for the design of next generation fault-tolerant distributed and cloud storage systems.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison"], "authors": ["Aishwarya Ganesan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganesan:Aishwarya", "Ramnatthan Alagappan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alagappan:Ramnatthan", "Andrea C.
