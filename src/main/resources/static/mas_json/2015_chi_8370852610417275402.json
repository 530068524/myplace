{"title": "StructJumper: A Tool to Help Blind Programmers Navigate and Understand the Structure of Code.", "fields": ["screen reader", "programmer", "java", "control flow", "plug in"], "abstract": "It can be difficult for a blind developer to understand and navigate through a large amount of code quickly, as they are unable to skim as easily as their sighted counterparts. To help blind developers overcome this problem, we present StructJumper, an Eclipse plugin that creates a hierarchical tree based on the nesting structure of a Java class. The programmer can use the TreeView to get an overview of the code structure of the class (including all the methods and control flow statements) and can quickly switch between the TreeView and the Text Editor to get an idea of where they are within the nested structure. To evaluate StructJumper, we had seven blind programmers complete three tasks with and without our tool. We found that the users thought they would use StructJumper and there was a trend that they were faster completing the tasks with StructJumper.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Catherine M.
