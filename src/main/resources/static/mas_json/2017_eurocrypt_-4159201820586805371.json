Envisioned with powerful applications such as searchable encryption, private-detectable watermarking and symmetric deniable encryption, the only known candidates of CHCPRFs are based on indistinguishability obfuscation or multilinear maps with strong security properties.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Boston University", "Boston University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Ran Canetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canetti:Ran", "Yilei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yilei"], "pages": 31}
