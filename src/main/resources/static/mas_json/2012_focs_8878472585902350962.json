The security guarantee is that the adversary learns nothing, beyond P's input/output behavior. This general problem is important for running cryptographic algorithms in the presence of side-channel attacks, as well as for running non-cryptographic algorithms, such as a proprietary search algorithm or a game, on a cloud server where parts of the execution's internals might be observed. Our main result is a compiler, which takes as input an algorithm P and a security parameter k, and produces a functionally equivalent algorithm P'. The running time of P' is a factor of poly(k)slower than P. P' will be composed of a series of calls to poly(k)-time computable sub-algorithms. During the executions of P', an adversary algorithm A, which can choose the inputs of P', can learn the results of adaptively chosen leakage functions -- each of bounded output size $\\tilde{\\Omega}(k)$ -- on the sub-algorithms of P' and the randomness they use. We prove that any {\\it computationally unbounded} A observing the results of computationally unbounded leakage functions, will learn no more from its observations than it could given black-box access only to the input-output behavior of P. This result is unconditional and does not rely on any secure hardware components.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Shafi Goldwasser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldwasser:Shafi", "Guy N.
