We report an approach for developing analyst-centered IV metrics that is built upon understanding the workplace needs and experiences of information analysts with respect to IVs. We derive metrics from human-computer interaction heuristics, specializing the metrics to address the characteristics of IVs and analysts. When there are no existing heuristics, analysts' needs and experiences inform new heuristics.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["National Institute of Standards and Technology", "National Institute of Standards and Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Theresa A.
