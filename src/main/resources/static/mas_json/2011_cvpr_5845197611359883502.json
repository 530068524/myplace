{"title": "Which parts of the face give out your identity?", "fields": ["vertex", "markov random field", "discriminative model", "feature selection", "facial recognition system"], "abstract": "We present a Markov Random Field model for the analysis of lattices (e.g., images or 3D meshes) in terms of the discriminative information of their vertices. The proposed method provides a measure field that estimates the probability of each vertex to be \u201cdiscriminative\u201d or \u201cnon-discriminative\u201d. As an application of the proposed framework, we present a method for the selection of compact and robust features for 3D face recognition. The resulting signature consists of 360 coefficients, based on which we are able to build a classifier yielding better recognition rates than currently reported in the literature. The main contribution of this work lies in the development of a novel framework for feature selection in scenarios in which the most discriminative information is known to be concentrated along piece-wise smooth regions of a lattice.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Houston", "University of Houston", "University of Houston"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Omar Ocegueda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ocegueda:Omar", "Shishir K.
