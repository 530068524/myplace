{"title": "Five Provocations for Ethical HCI Research.", "fields": ["judgement", "management science", "informed consent", "applied psychology", "unintended consequences"], "abstract": "We present five provocations for ethics, and ethical research, in HCI. We discuss, in turn, informed consent, the researcher-participant power differential, presentation of data in publications, the role of ethical review boards, and, lastly, corporate-facilitated projects. By pointing to unintended consequences of regulation and oversimplifications of unresolvable moral conflicts, we propose these provocations not as guidelines or recommendations but as instruments for challenging our views on what it means to do ethical research in HCI. We then suggest an alternative grounded in the sensitivities of those being studied and based on everyday practice and judgement, rather than one driven by bureaucratic, legal, or philosophical concerns. In conclusion, we call for a wider and more practical discussion on ethics within the community, and suggest that we should be more supportive of low-risk ethical experimentation to further the field.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stockholm University", "University of Gothenburg", "Stockholm University", "Stockholm University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Barry A.
