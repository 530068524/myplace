Consequently, recent years have witnessed tremendous research efforts towards an understanding of how the seminal AGM theory of belief change can be applied to argumentation, in particular for Dung's abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs). However, none of the attempts has yet succeeded in handling the natural situation where the revision of an AF is guaranteed to be representable by an AF as well. In this work, we present a generic solution to this problem which applies to many prominent I-maximal argumentation semantics. In order to prove a full representation theorem, we make use of recent advances in both areas of argumentation and belief change. In particular, we utilize the concepts of realizability in argumentation and the notion of compliance as used in Horn revision.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "University of Sydney", "Vienna University of Technology"], "authors": ["Martin Diller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diller:Martin", "Adrian Haret.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Haret:Adrian", "Thomas Linsbichler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Linsbichler:Thomas", "Stefan R\u00fcmmele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=uuml=mmele:Stefan", "Stefan Woltran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Woltran:Stefan"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
