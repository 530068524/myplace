{"title": "Using Strategic Logics to Reason about Agent Programs.", "fields": ["alternating time temporal logic", "non classical logic", "temporal logic of actions", "temporal logic", "belief desire intention software model"], "abstract": "We propose a variant of Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) grounded in the agents' operational know-how, as defined by their libraries of abstract plans. In our logic, it is possible to refer to \"rational\" strategies for agents developed under the Belief-Desire-Intention agent paradigm. This allows us to express and verify properties of BDI systems using ATL-type logical frameworks.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2013", "departments": ["RMIT University", "RMIT University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Nitin Yadav.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yadav:Nitin", "Sebastian Sardi\u00f1a.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sardi=ntilde=a:Sebastian"], "pages": 5}
