{"title": "Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data.", "fields": ["scale up", "vector space", "embedding", "canonical model", "relational database"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of embedding entities and relationships of multi-relational data in low-dimensional vector spaces. Our objective is to propose a canonical model which is easy to train, contains a reduced number of parameters and can scale up to very large databases. Hence, we propose TransE, a method which models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases. Besides, it can be successfully trained on a large scale data set with 1M entities, 25k relationships and more than 17M training samples.", "citation": "Citations (822)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Google", "Google"], "authors": ["Antoine Bordes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bordes:Antoine", "Nicolas Usunier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Usunier:Nicolas", "Alberto Garc\u00eda-Dur\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garc=iacute=a=Dur=aacute=n:Alberto", "Jason Weston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weston:Jason", "Oksana Yakhnenko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yakhnenko:Oksana"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
