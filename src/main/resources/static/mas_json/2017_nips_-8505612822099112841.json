{"title": "Kernel Feature Selection via Conditional Covariance Minimization.", "fields": ["radial basis function kernel", "kernel principal component analysis", "variable kernel density estimation", "kernel regression", "kernel embedding of distributions"], "abstract": "We propose a method for feature selection that employs kernel-based measures of independence to find a subset of covariates that is maximally predictive of the response. Building on past work in kernel dimension reduction, we show how to perform feature selection via a constrained optimization problem involving the trace of the conditional covariance operator. We prove various consistency results for this procedure, and also demonstrate that our method compares favorably with other state-of-the-art algorithms on a variety of synthetic and real data sets.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Jianbo Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jianbo", "Mitchell Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Mitchell", "Martin J.
