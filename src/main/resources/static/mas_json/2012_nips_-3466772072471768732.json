To implement the test, we introduce a novel, hierarchical, minimum-volume sets estimator to represent the distributions to be tested. Our work is motivated by the need to detect changes in data streams, and the test is especially efficient in this context. We provide the theoretical foundations of our test and show its superiority over existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Assaf Glazer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Glazer:Assaf", "Michael Lindenbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindenbaum:Michael", "Shaul Markovitch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Markovitch:Shaul"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
