Our work is inspired by prior work that treats the Internet and bandwidth as an approximate tree metric space. This paper presents a decentralized, accurate, and low cost system that predicts pairwise bandwidth between hosts. We describe an algorithm to construct a distributed tree that embeds bandwidth measurements. The correctness of the algorithm is provable when driven by precise measurements. We then describe three novel heuristics that achieve high accuracy for predicting bandwidth even with imprecise input data. Simulation experiments with a real-world dataset confirm that our approach shows high accuracy with low cost.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Sukhyun Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Sukhyun", "Peter J.
