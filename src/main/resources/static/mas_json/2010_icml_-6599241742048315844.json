We establish the intractability of two basic computational tasks involving RBMs, even if only a coarse approximation to the correct output is required.\n\nWe first show that assuming P \u2260 NP, for any fixed positive constant K (which may be arbitrarily large) there is no polynomial-time algorithm for the following problem: given an n-bit input string x and the parameters of a RBM M, output an estimate of the probability assigned to x by M that is accurate to within a multiplicative factor of eKn. This hardness result holds even if the parameters of M are constrained to be at most \u03a8(n) for any function \u03a8(n) that grows faster than linearly, and if the number of hidden nodes of M is at most n.\n\nWe then show that assuming RP \u2260 NP, there is no polynomial-time randomized algorithm for the following problem: given the parameters of an RBM M, generate a random example from a probability distribution whose total variation distance from the distribution defined by M is at most 1/12.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Google", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Philip M.
