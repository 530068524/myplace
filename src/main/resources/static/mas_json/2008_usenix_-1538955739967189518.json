However, there is little published work about their internal organization or the design choices that SSD manufacturers face in pursuit of optimal performance. This paper presents a taxonomy of such design choices and analyzes the likely performance of various configurations using a trace-driven simulator and workload traces extracted from real systems. We find that SSD performance and lifetime is highly workload-sensitive, and that complex systems problems that normally appear higher in the storage stack, or even in distributed systems, are relevant to device firmware.", "citation": "Citations (1,161)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Nitin Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Nitin", "Vijayan Prabhakaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakaran:Vijayan", "Ted Wobber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wobber:Ted", "John D.
