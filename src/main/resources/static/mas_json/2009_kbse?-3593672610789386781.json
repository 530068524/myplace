In this work, we present TRICA, an open source-based software development infrastructure. The name of TRICA represents its features such as Traceability, Relationship, Informativeness, Cost-effectiveness, and Automation. Essentially, in TRICA, a continuous integration tool is coupled with a software configuration management tool and an issue tracking tool. We provisioned a mechanism to connect the open source tools in TRICA so that project members use the collaborated information to solve various issues and implementation problems efficiently, and easily share forthcoming issues during the course of the project. We show that TRICA can help to decentralize risks throughout the software development cycle and achieve successful software development.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Samsung", "Samsung"], "authors": ["Yuhoon Ki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ki:Yuhoon", "Meongchul Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Meongchul"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
