Most work in KBC focuses on knowledge bases like Freebase that relate entities drawn from a fixed set. However, the tuples in ConceptNet (Speer and Havasi, 2012) define relations between an unbounded set of phrases. We develop neural network models for scoring tuples on arbitrary phrases and evaluate them by their ability to distinguish true held-out tuples from false ones. We find strong performance from a bilinear model using a simple additive architecture to model phrases. We manually evaluate our trained model\u2019s ability to assign quality scores to novel tuples, finding that it can propose tuples at the same quality level as mediumconfidence tuples from ConceptNet.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Illinois at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago", "Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xiang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiang", "Aynaz Taheri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taheri:Aynaz", "Lifu Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Lifu", "Kevin Gimpel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gimpel:Kevin"], "pages": -1}
