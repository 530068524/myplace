{"title": "Domain-Independent Abstract Generation for Focused Meeting Summarization.", "fields": ["machine learning", "natural language processing", "natural language", "fluency", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "We address the challenge of generating natural language abstractive summaries for spoken meetings in a domain-independent fashion. We apply Multiple-Sequence Alignment to induce abstract generation templates that can be used for different domains. An Overgenerateand-Rank strategy is utilized to produce and rank candidate abstracts. Experiments using in-domain and out-of-domain training on disparate corpora show that our system uniformly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised extract-based approaches. In addition, human judges rate our system summaries significantly higher than compared systems in fluency and overall quality.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Lu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0008:Lu", "Claire Cardie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cardie:Claire"], "pages": 11}
