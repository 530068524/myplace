High frequency (1 kHz-) simulation is required for stable control over haptic interfaces for meaningful haptic interactions. However, high frequency simulation tends to cause overflow of computational quantity and make simulation for virtual worlds in large scale difficult.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Electro-Communications", "University of Electro-Communications", "University of Electro-Communications", "University of Electro-Communications", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Ikumi Susa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Susa:Ikumi", "Yuto Ikeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ikeda:Yuto", "Takashi Tokizaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tokizaki:Takashi", "Hironori Mitake.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitake:Hironori", "Makoto Sato.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sato:Makoto", "Shoichi Hasegawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hasegawa:Shoichi"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2008", "pages": 1}
