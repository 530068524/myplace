Inspired by recent advances in batch image alignment using low rank decomposition [ ], we treat the newly arrived image, after alignment, as being linearly and sparsely reconstructed by the well-aligned ones. The task is accomplished by a sequence of convex optimization that minimizes the l\\-norm. After that, online basis updating is pursued in two different ways: (1) a two-stage incremental alignment for joint registration of a large image dataset which is known a prior, and (2) a greedy online alignment of dynamically increasing image sequences, such as in the tracking scenario. In (1), we first sequentially collect basis images that are easily aligned by checking their reconstruction residuals, followed by the second stage where all images are re-aligned one-by-one using the collected basis set. In (2), during the tracking process, we dynamically enrich the image basis set by the new target if it significantly distinguishes itself from existing basis images. While inheriting the benefits of sparsity, our method enjoys the great time efficiency and therefore be capable of dealing with large image set and real time tasks such as visual tracking. The efficacy of the proposed online robust alignment algorithm is verified with extensive experiments on image set alignment and visual tracking, in reference with state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Temple University", "Purdue University", "Temple University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Yi", "Bin Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Bin", "Haibin Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Haibin"], "pages": 7}
