Because a CMOS sensor scans one line of video in sequence, fast moving objects are distorted during the scanning sequence. The morphing and distorting are called a rolling shutter effect, which is considered to be an artistic photographic techniques like strip photography and slit-scan photography. However, the effect can only be seen on a camera finder or a PC screen; the guitar player and audience are quite unlikely to notice it by the naked eye.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Shogo Fukushima.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fukushima:Shogo", "Takeshi Naemura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naemura:Takeshi"], "conf": "siggraph", "year": "2015", "pages": 1}
