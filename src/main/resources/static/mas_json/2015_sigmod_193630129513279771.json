{"title": "Rethinking SIMD Vectorization for In-Memory Databases.", "fields": ["vectorization", "simd", "joins", "hash table", "xeon phi"], "abstract": "Analytical databases are continuously adapting to the underlying hardware in order to saturate all sources of parallelism. At the same time, hardware evolves in multiple directions to explore different trade-offs. The MIC architecture, one such example, strays from the mainstream CPU design by packing a larger number of simpler cores per chip, relying on SIMD instructions to fill the performance gap. Databases have been attempting to utilize the SIMD capabilities of CPUs. However, mainstream CPUs have only recently adopted wider SIMD registers and more advanced instructions, since they do not rely primarily on SIMD for efficiency. In this paper, we present novel vectorized designs and implementations of database operators, based on advanced SIMD operations, such as gathers and scatters. We study selections, hash tables, and partitioning; and combine them to build sorting and joins. Our evaluation on the MIC-based Xeon Phi co-processor as well as the latest mainstream CPUs shows that our vectorization designs are up to an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art scalar and vector approaches. Also, we highlight the impact of efficient vectorization on the algorithmic design of in-memory database operators, as well as the architectural design and power efficiency of hardware, by making simple cores comparably fast to complex cores. This work is applicable to CPUs and co-processors with advanced SIMD capabilities, using either many simple cores or fewer complex cores.", "citation": "Citations (84)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Oracle Corporation", "Columbia University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Orestis Polychroniou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Polychroniou:Orestis", "Arun Raghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavan:Arun", "Kenneth A.
