{"title": "PBGT tool: an integrated modeling and testing environment for pattern-based GUI testing.", "fields": ["systems engineering", "graphical user interface testing", "plug in", "computer science"], "abstract": "Pattern Based GUI Testing (PBGT) is a new methodology that aims at systematizing and automating the GUI testing process. It is supported by a Tool (PBGT Tool) which provides an integrated modeling and testing environment that supports the crafting of test models based on UI Test Patterns, using a GUI modeling DSL called PARADIGM. The tool is freely available as an Eclipse plugin, developed on top of the Eclipse Modeling Framework. This paper presents PBGT Tool, which has been successfully used in several projects, and more recently at industry level.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Porto", "University of Porto"], "authors": ["Rodrigo M.
