The most existing image annotation approaches which mainly focus on annotating images with \"object\" concepts may not well describe the image semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel image annotation approach by learning \"verb-object\" concepts. The \"verb-object\" concept learning method is developed based on the assumption that the classifiers of the \"verb-object\" concepts which contain the same object usually share a common structure. We formulate each \"verb-object\" concept classifier as a combination of a private part and a common part shared by all the \"verb-object\" concepts containing the same object. These classifiers are learned simultaneously through a joint optimization process. Experiments on a Web image data set containing 22,812 images with 28 concepts demonstrate that the proposed approach achieved promising performance compared to the baseline method.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Institute of Au ...
