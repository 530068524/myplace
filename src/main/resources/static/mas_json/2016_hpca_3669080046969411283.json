{"title": "DUANG: Fast and lightweight page migration in asymmetric memory systems.", "fields": ["conventional memory", "uniform memory access", "registered memory", "memory map", "interleaved memory"], "abstract": "Main memory systems have gone through dramatic increases in bandwidth and capacity. At the same time, their random access latency has remained relatively constant. For given memory technology, optimizing the latency typically requires sacrificing the density (i.e., cost per bit), which is one of the most critical concerns for memory industry. Recent studies have proposed memory architectures comprised of asymmetric (fast/low-density and slow/high-density) regions to optimize between overall latency and negative impact on density. Such memory architectures attempt to cost-effectively offer both high capacity and high performance. Yet they present a unique challenge, requiring direct placements of hot memory pages1 in the fast region and/or expensive runtime page migrations. In this paper, we propose a novel resistive memory architecture sharing a set of row buffers between a pair of neighboring banks. It enables two attractive techniques: (1) migrating memory pages between slow and fast banks with little performance overhead and (2) adaptively allocating more row buffers to busier banks based on memory access patterns. For an asymmetric memory architecture with both slow/high-density and fast/low-density banks, our shared row-buffer architecture can capture 87\u201393% of the performance of a memory architecture with only fast banks.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison", "Yonsei University", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Yonsei University"], "authors": ["Hao Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0011:Hao", "Jie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0048:Jie", "Sharmila Shridhar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shridhar:Sharmila", "Gieseo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Gieseo", "Myoungsoo Jung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jung:Myoungsoo", "Nam Sung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Nam_Sung"], "conf": "hpca", "year": "2016", "pages": 13}
