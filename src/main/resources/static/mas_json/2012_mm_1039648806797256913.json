{"title": "3D photo browsing for future mobile devices.", "fields": ["interaction design", "user experience design", "video browsing", "motion analysis", "mobile technology"], "abstract": "By introducing the interactive 3D photo/video browsing and exploration system, we propose novel approaches for handling the limitations of the current 2D mobile technology from two aspects: interaction design and visualization. Our contributions feature an effective interaction that happens in the 3D space behind the mobile device's camera. 3D motion analysis of the user's gesture captured by the device's camera is performed to facilitate the interaction between users and multimedia collections in various applications. This approach will solve a wide range of problems with the current input facilities such as miniature keyboards, tiny joysticks and 2D touch screens. The suggested interactive technology enables users to control, manipulate, organize, and re-arrange their photo/video collections in 3D space using bare-hand, marker-less gesture. Moreover, with the proposed techniques we aim to visualize the 2D photo collection, in 3D, on normal 2D displays. This process is automatically done by retrieving the 3D structure from single images, finding the stereo/multiple views of a scene or using the geo-tagged meta-data from huge photo collections. By using the design and implementation of the contributions of this work, we aim to achieve the following goals: Solving the limitations of the current 2D interaction facilities by 3D gestural interaction; Increasing the usability of the multimedia applications on mobile devices; Enhancing the quality of user experience with the digital collections.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Ume\u00e5 University"], "authors": ["Shahrouz Yousefi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yousefi:Shahrouz"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
