Solutions of an ALLDIFFERENT constraint can be seen as perfect matchings on the variable/value bipartite graph. Therefore, we investigate the problem of finding simultaneous bipartite match-ings. We present an extension of the famous Hall theorem which characterizes when simultaneous bipartite matchings exists. Unfortunately, finding such matchings is NP-hard in general. However, we prove a surprising result that finding a simultaneous matching on a convex bipartite graph takes just polynomial time. Based on this theoretical result, we provide the first polynomial time bound consistency algorithm for the conjunction of two ALLDIFFERENT constraints. We identify a pathological problem on which this propagator is exponentially faster compared to existing propagators. Our experiments show that this new propagator can offer significant benefits over existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "NICTA", "Laval University", "NICTA"], "authors": ["Christian Bessiere.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bessiere:Christian", "George Katsirelos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katsirelos:George", "Nina Narodytska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narodytska:Nina", "Claude-Guy Quimper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quimper:Claude=Guy", "Toby Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh:Toby"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
