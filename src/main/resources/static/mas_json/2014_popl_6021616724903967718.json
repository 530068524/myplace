At the lowest level, the SAFE hardware supports fine-grained programmable tags, with efficient and flexible propagation and combination of tags as instructions are executed. The operating system virtualizes these generic facilities to present an information-flow abstract machine that allows user programs to label sensitive data with rich confidentiality policies. We present a formal, machine-checked model of the key hardware and software mechanisms used to control information flow in SAFE and an end-to-end proof of noninterference for this model.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "Portland State University", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Arthur Azevedo de Amorim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amorim:Arthur_Azevedo_de", "Nathan Collins.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Collins:Nathan", "Andr\u00e9 DeHon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeHon:Andr=eacute=", "Delphine Demange.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demange:Delphine", "Catalin Hritcu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hritcu:Catalin", "David Pichardie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pichardie:David", "Benjamin C.
