We investigate the role of finite levels of iterated reasoning and non-selfish utility functions in a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process model that incorporates game theoretic notions of interactivity. Our generative model captures a broad class of characteristic behaviours in a multi-round Investor-Trustee game. We invert the generative process for a recognition model that is used to classify 200 subjects playing this game against randomly matched opponents.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University College London", "California Institute of Technology", "Texas Medical Center", "Baylor College of Medicine", "Baylor College of Medicine", "University College London"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Debajyoti Ray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ray:Debajyoti", "Brooks King-Casas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/King=Casas:Brooks", "P.
