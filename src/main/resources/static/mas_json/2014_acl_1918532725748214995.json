We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all-subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory. Then, we show that these measures can help improve a number of existing machine translation evaluation metrics both at the segment- and at the system-level. Rather than proposing a single new metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, and thus should be taken into account in the development of future richer evaluation metrics.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute", "Qatar Computing Research Institute"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Francisco Guzm\u00e1n.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guzm=aacute=n:Francisco", "Shafiq R.
