The robot was transporting goods and samples for an orthopedic department, moving within and between different departments for 13 days, and was used by the staff for five days. Based on this case, we discuss how the robot was perceived by staff and visitors and purpose an initial framework, a utopian model, describing four different perspectives; an alien, a machine, a worker and as a work partner. This has been derived from interviews, questionnaires and observation, and exemplifies different qualities that the robot was ascribed. We discuss how the perspectives may mutually co-exist and change, and are affected by time and familiarity with the robot at work.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["LOTS Design AB, ... , Kista, Sweden", "Robcab Systems  ... \u00e4ster\u00e4s, Sweden", "Mobile Life Cen ... , Kista, Sweden", "Mobile Life Cen ... , Kista, Sweden", "Robcab Systems  ... \u00e4ster\u00e4s, Sweden"], "authors": ["Sara Ljungblad.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ljungblad:Sara", "Jirina Kotrbova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kotrbova:Jirina", "Mattias Jacobsson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jacobsson:Mattias", "Henriette S.
