We introduce team dating, where people interact on brief tasks before working with a dedicated partner for longer, more complex tasks. We studied team dating through two online experiments. In Experiment 1, workers from a crowd platform independently wrote an ad slogan, discussed it with three consecutive people and evaluated their team date interactions. They then selected preferred teammates from a list showing average ratings for people they had dated and not dated. Results show that participants evaluated their dates based on evidence beyond externally judged slogan quality, and relied heavily on their dyad-specific judgments in selecting teammates. In Experiment 2, we replicated the individual and team dating tasks, and formed teams, either i) by honoring pairwise team dating preferences, ii) randomly from their pool of dates, or iii) randomly from those not dated. Results show that teams formed from preferred dates performed better on a final creative task compared to random dates or non-dates. Team dating provides a dynamic technique for forming ad hoc teams accounting for interpersonal dynamics. The initial interactions provided information that helped people select and work with an appropriate teammate.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, San Diego", "Luxembourg Inst ... ity, Luxembourg"], "authors": ["Ioanna Lykourentzou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lykourentzou:Ioanna", "Robert E.
