{"title": "Weighted Path as a Condensed Pattern in a Single Attributed DAG.", "fields": ["compact space", "pattern language", "scalability", "directed acyclic graph", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Directed acyclic graphs can be used across many application domains. In this paper, we study a new pattern domain for supporting their analysis. Therefore, we propose the pattern language of weighted paths, primitive constraints that enable to specify their relevancy (e.g., frequency and compactness constraints), and algorithms that can compute the specified collections. It leads to a condensed representation setting whose efficiency and scalability are empirically studied.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "University of Lyon", "PPME, Universit ...
