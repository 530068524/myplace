{"title": "Utilizing Knowledge Graphs for Text-Centric Information Retrieval.", "fields": ["data mining", "graph", "information retrieval", "dissemination", "entity linking"], "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed the emergence of several publicly available and proprietary knowledge graphs (KGs). The depth and breadth of content in these KGs made them not only rich sources of structured knowledge by themselves, but also valuable resources for search systems. A surge of recent developments in entity linking and entity retrieval methods gave rise to a new line of research that aims at utilizing KGs for text-centric retrieval applications. This tutorial is the first to summarize and disseminate the progress in this emerging area to industry practitioners and researchers.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of New Hampshire", "Wayne State University", "Bloomberg, Lond ...
