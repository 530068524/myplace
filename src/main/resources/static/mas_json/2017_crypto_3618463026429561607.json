In all existing protocols, the number of arithmetic operations per multiplication gate grows either linearly with \\(\\log |\\mathbb {F}|\\) or polylogarithmically with the security parameter. We present the first protocol that only makes a constant (amortized) number of field operations per gate. The protocol uses the underlying field \\(\\mathbb {F}\\) as a black box, and its security is based on arithmetic analogues of well-studied cryptographic assumptions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tel Aviv University", "Aarhus University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Aarhus University", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Benny Applebaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Applebaum:Benny", "Ivan Damg\u00e5rd.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Damg=aring=rd:Ivan", "Yuval Ishai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishai:Yuval", "Michael Nielsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nielsen_0001:Michael", "Lior Zichron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zichron:Lior"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2017", "pages": 32}
