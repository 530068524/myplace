This paper describes Runnemede, the research architecture developed by the Intel-led UHPC team. Runnemede is being developed through a co-design process that considers the hardware, the runtime/OS, and applications simultaneously. Near-threshold voltage operation, fine-grained power and clock management, and separate execution units for runtime and application code are used to reduce energy consumption. Memory energy is minimized through application-managed on-chip memory and direct physical addressing. A hierarchical on-chip network reduces communication energy, and a codelet-based execution model supports extreme parallelism and fine-grained tasks. We present an initial evaluation of Runnemede that shows the design process for our on-chip network, demonstrates 2-4x improvements in memory energy from explicit control of on-chip memory, and illustrates the impact of hardware-software co-design on the energy consumption of a synthetic aperture radar algorithm on our architecture.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Nicholas P.
