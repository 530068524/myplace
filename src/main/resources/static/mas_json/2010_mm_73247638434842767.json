{"title": "Topical summarization of web videos by visual-text time-dependent alignment.", "fields": ["timeline", "visualization", "search engine", "gist", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "Search engines are used to return a long list of hundreds or even thousands of videos in response to a query topic. Efficient navigation of videos becomes difficult and users often need to painstakingly explore the search list for a gist of the search result. This paper addresses the challenge of topical summarization by providing a timeline-based visualization of videos through matching of heterogeneous sources. To overcome the so called sparse-text problem of web videos, auxiliary information from Google context is exploited. Google Trends is used to predict the milestone events of a topic. Meanwhile, the typical scenes of web videos are extracted by visual near-duplicate threading. Visual-text alignment is then conducted to align scenes from videos and articles from Google News. The outcome is a set of scene-news pairs, each representing an event mapped to the milestone timeline of a topic. The timeline-based visualization provides a glimpse of major events about a topic. We conduct both the quantitative and subjective studies to evaluate the practicality of the application.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Song Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Song", "Hung-Khoon Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Hung=Khoon", "Chong-Wah Ngo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Ngo:Chong=Wah"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
