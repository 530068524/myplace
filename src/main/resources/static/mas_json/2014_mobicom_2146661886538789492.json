{"title": "Accurate indoor localization with zero start-up cost.", "fields": ["synthetic aperture radar", "software deployment", "accelerometer", "geotagging", "mobile device"], "abstract": "Recent years have seen the advent of new RF-localization systems that demonstrate tens of centimeters of accuracy. However, such systems require either deployment of new infrastructure, or extensive fingerprinting of the environment through training or crowdsourcing, impeding their wide-scale adoption.   We present Ubicarse, an accurate indoor localization system for commodity mobile devices, with no specialized infrastructure or fingerprinting. Ubicarse enables handheld devices to emulate large antenna arrays using a new formulation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Past work on SAR requires measuring mechanically controlled device movement with millimeter precision, far beyond what commercial accelerometers can provide. In contrast, Ubicarse's core contribution is the ability to perform SAR on handheld devices twisted by their users along unknown paths. Ubicarse is not limited to localizing RF devices; it combines RF localization with stereo-vision algorithms to localize common objects with no RF source attached to them. We implement Ubicarse on a HP SplitX2 tablet and empirically demonstrate a median error of 39 cm in 3-D device localization and 17 cm in object geotagging in complex indoor settings.", "citation": "Citations (161)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Swarun Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar:Swarun", "Stephanie Gil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gil:Stephanie", "Dina Katabi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katabi:Dina", "Daniela Rus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rus:Daniela"], "conf": "mobicom", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
