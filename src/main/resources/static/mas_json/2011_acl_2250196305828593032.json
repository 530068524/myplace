In this paper, we propose to extract topical keyphrases as one way to summarize Twitter. We propose a context-sensitive topical PageRank method for keyword ranking and a probabilistic scoring function that considers both relevance and interestingness of keyphrases for keyphrase ranking. We evaluate our proposed methods on a large Twitter data set. Experiments show that these methods are very effective for topical keyphrase extraction.", "citation": "Citations (247)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Peking University", "Singapore Management University", "Peking University", "Singapore Management University", "Singapore Management University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Wayne Xin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wayne_Xin", "Jing Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Jing", "Jing He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Jing", "Yang Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Yang", "Palakorn Achananuparp.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Achananuparp:Palakorn", "Ee-Peng Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Ee=Peng", "Xiaoming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiaoming"], "pages": 10}
