Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. One central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. To this end, we formulate Conditional Random Fields with Gaussian pairwise potentials and mean-field approximate inference as Recurrent Neural Networks. This network, called CRF-RNN, is then plugged in as a part of a CNN to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. We apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark.", "citation": "Citations (1,124)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Shuai Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0001:Shuai", "Sadeep Jayasumana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jayasumana:Sadeep", "Bernardino Romera-Paredes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romera=Paredes:Bernardino", "Vibhav Vineet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vineet:Vibhav", "Zhizhong Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Zhizhong", "Dalong Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Dalong", "Chang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chang", "Philip H.
