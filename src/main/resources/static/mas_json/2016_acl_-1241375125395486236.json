{"title": "A Vector Space for Distributional Semantics for Entailment.", "fields": ["approximate inference", "preferential entailment", "word2vec", "distributional semantics", "textual entailment"], "abstract": "Distributional semantics creates vector-space representations that capture many forms of semantic similarity, but their relation to semantic entailment has been less clear. We propose a vector-space model which provides a formal foundation for a distributional semantics of entailment. Using a mean-field approximation, we develop approximate inference procedures and entailment operators over vectors of probabilities of features being known (versus unknown). We use this framework to reinterpret an existing distributional-semantic model (Word2Vec) as approximating an entailment-based model of the distributions of words in contexts, thereby predicting lexical entailment relations. In both unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on hyponymy detection, we get substantial improvements over previous results.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Xerox"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["James Henderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henderson:James", "Diana Nicoleta Popa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popa:Diana_Nicoleta"], "pages": -1}
