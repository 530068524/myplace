{"title": "Doppio: breaking the browser language barrier.", "fields": ["interpreter", "rich internet application", "javascript", "heap", "instruction set"], "abstract": "Web browsers have become a  de facto  universal operating system, and JavaScript its instruction set. Unfortunately, running other languages in the browser is not generally possible. Translation to JavaScript is not enough because browsers are a hostile environment for other languages. Previous approaches are either non-portable or require extensive modifications for programs to work in a browser.   This paper presents Doppio, a JavaScript-based runtime system that makes it possible to run unaltered applications written in general-purpose languages directly inside the browser. Doppio provides a wide range of runtime services, including a file system that enables local and external (cloud-based) storage, an unmanaged heap, sockets, blocking I/O, and multiple threads. We demonstrate DOPPIO's usefulness with two case studies: we extend Emscripten with Doppio, letting it run an unmodified C++ application in the browser with full functionality, and present DoppioJVM, an interpreter that runs unmodified JVM programs directly in the browser. While substantially slower than a native JVM (between 24X and 42X slower on CPU-intensive benchmarks in Google Chrome), DoppioJVM makes it feasible to directly reuse existing, non compute-intensive code.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["John Vilk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vilk:John", "Emery D.
