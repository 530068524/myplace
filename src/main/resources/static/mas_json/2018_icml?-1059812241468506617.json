We achieve this by using quantile regression to approximate the full quantile function for the state-action return distribution. By reparameterizing a distribution over the sample space, this yields an implicitly defined return distribution and gives rise to a large class of risk-sensitive policies. We demonstrate improved performance on the 57 Atari 2600 games in the ALE, and use our algorithm's implicitly defined distributions to study the effects of risk-sensitive policies in Atari games.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "DeepMind", "DeepMind"], "authors": ["Will Dabney.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dabney:Will", "Georg Ostrovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ostrovski:Georg", "David Silver.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silver:David", "R\u00e9mi Munos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Munos:R=eacute=mi"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
