Most approaches use incremental algorithms that solve progressively larger bundle adjustment problems. These incremental techniques scale poorly as the number of images grows, and can drift or fall into bad local minima. We present an alternative formulation for SfM based on finding a coarse initial solution using a hybrid discrete-continuous optimization, and then improving that solution using bundle adjustment. The initial optimization step uses a discrete Markov random field (MRF) formulation, coupled with a continuous Levenberg-Marquardt refinement. The formulation naturally incorporates various sources of information about both the cameras and the points, including noisy geotags and vanishing point estimates. We test our method on several large-scale photo collections, including one with measured camera positions, and show that it can produce models that are similar to or better than those produced with incremental bundle adjustment, but more robustly and in a fraction of the time.", "citation": "Citations (271)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["David J.
