We study 104 distributed concurrency (DC) bugs from four widely-deployed cloud-scale datacenter distributed systems, Cassandra, Hadoop MapReduce, HBase and ZooKeeper. We study DC-bug characteristics along several axes of analysis such as the triggering timing condition and input preconditions, error and failure symptoms, and fix strategies, collectively stored as 2,083 classification labels in TaxDC database. We discuss how our study can open up many new research directions in combating DC bugs.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago", "University of Chicago"], "conf": "asplos", "authors": ["Tanakorn Leesatapornwongsa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leesatapornwongsa:Tanakorn", "Jeffrey F.
