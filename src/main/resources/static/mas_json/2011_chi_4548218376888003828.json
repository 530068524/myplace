One informal design guideline for creating effective animated transitions has long been the use of slow-in/slow-out pacing, but no empirical data exist to support this practice. We remedy this by studying object tracking performance under different conditions of temporal distortion, i.e., constant speed transitions, slow-in/slow-out, fast-in/fast-out, and an adaptive technique that slows down the visually complex parts of the animation. Slow-in/slow-out outperformed other techniques, but we saw technique differences depending on the type of visual transition.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "Purdue University", "Purdue University", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Pierre Dragicevic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dragicevic:Pierre", "Anastasia Bezerianos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bezerianos:Anastasia", "Waqas Javed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Javed:Waqas", "Niklas Elmqvist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elmqvist:Niklas", "Jean-Daniel Fekete.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fekete:Jean=Daniel"], "pages": 10}
