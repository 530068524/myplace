The algorithm (a) runs in O(n log3 n + m log n) time on graphs with n vertices and m edges, and (b) with high probability, finds all \"large enough\" clusters in a random graph generated according to the planted partition model. We provide lower bounds that imply that our \"large enough\" constraint cannot be improved much, even using a computationally unbounded algorithm. We describe some experiments running the algorithm and a few related algorithms on random graphs with partitions generated using a Chinese Restaurant Processes, and some results of applying the algorithm to cluster DBLP titles.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Google"], "authors": ["Nader H.
