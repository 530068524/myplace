{"title": "Scale and Concurrency of GIGA+: File System Directories with Millions of Files.", "fields": ["directory", "computer file", "file system", "working directory", "file system fragmentation"], "abstract": "We examine the problem of scalable file system directories, motivated by data-intensive applications requiring millions to billions of small files to be ingested in a single directory at rates of hundreds of thousands of file creates every second. We introduce a POSIX-compliant scalable directory design, GIGA+, that distributes directory entries over a cluster of server nodes. For scalability, each server makes only local, independent decisions about migration for load balancing. GIGA+ uses two internal implementation tenets, asynchrony and eventual consistency, to: (1) partition an index among all servers without synchronization or serialization, and (2) gracefully tolerate stale index state at the clients. Applications, however, are provided traditional strong synchronous consistency semantics. We have built and demonstrated that the GIGA+ approach scales better than existing distributed directory implementations, delivers a sustained throughput of more than 98,000 file creates per second on a 32-server cluster, and balances load more efficiently than consistent hashing.", "citation": "Citations (136)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Swapnil Patil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patil:Swapnil", "Garth A.
