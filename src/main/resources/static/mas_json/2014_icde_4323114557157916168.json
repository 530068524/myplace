In this paper, we study k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries where the mobile user queries the location-based service (LBS) provider about k nearest points of interest (POIs) on the basis of his current location. We propose a solution for the mobile user to preserve his location privacy in kNN queries. The proposed solution is built on the Paillier public-key cryptosystem and can provide both location privacy and data privacy. In particular, our solution allows the mobile user to retrieve one type of POIs, for example, k nearest car parks, without revealing to the LBS provider what type of points is retrieved. For a cloaking region with n\u00d7n cells and m types of points, the total communication complexity for the mobile user to retrieve a type of k nearest POIs is O(n+m) while the computation complexities of the mobile user and the LBS provider are O(n + m) and O(n 2 m), respectively. Compared with existing solutions for kNN queries with location privacy, our solutions are more efficient. Experiments have shown that our solutions are practical for kNN queries.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "departments": ["Victoria University, Australia", "Victoria University, Australia", "Purdue University", "Macquarie University"], "authors": ["Xun Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi:Xun", "Russell Paulet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paulet:Russell", "Elisa Bertino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bertino:Elisa", "Vijay Varadharajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Varadharajan:Vijay"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
