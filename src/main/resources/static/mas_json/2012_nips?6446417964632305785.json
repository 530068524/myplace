We answer this question by deriving spiking dynamics and learning dynamics directly from a measure of network performance. We find that a network of integrate-and-fire neurons undergoing Hebbian plasticity can learn an optimal spike-based representation for a linear decoder. The learning rule acts to minimise the membrane potential magnitude, which can be interpreted as a representation error after learning. In this way, learning reduces the representation error and drives the network into a robust, balanced regime. The network becomes balanced because small representation errors correspond to small membrane potentials, which in turn results from a balance of excitation and inhibition. The representation is robust because neurons become self-correcting, only spiking if the representation error exceeds a threshold. Altogether, these results suggest that several observed features of cortical dynamics, such as excitatory-inhibitory balance, integrate-and-fire dynamics and Hebbian plasticity, are signatures of a robust, optimal spike-based code.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "Champalimaud Ne ... sbon, Portugal"], "authors": ["Ralph Bourdoukan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bourdoukan:Ralph", "David G.
