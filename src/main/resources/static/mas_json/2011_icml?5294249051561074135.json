{"title": "Multiclass Classification with Bandit Feedback using Adaptive Regularization.", "fields": ["multiclass classification", "perceptron", "regret", "regularization", "online algorithm"], "abstract": "We present a new multiclass algorithm in the bandit framework, where after making a prediction, the learning algorithm receives only partial feedback, i.e., a single bit indicating whether the predicted label is correct or not, rather than the true label. Our algorithm is based on the second-order Perceptron, and uses upper-confidence bounds to trade-off exploration and exploitation, instead of random sampling as performed by most current algorithms. We analyze this algorithm in a partial adversarial setting, where instances are chosen adversarially, while the labels are chosen according to a linear probabilistic model which is also chosen adversarially. We show a regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T}\\log T)$ , which improves over the current best bounds of $\\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ in the fully adversarial setting. We evaluate our algorithm on nine real-world text classification problems and on four vowel recognition tasks, often obtaining state-of-the-art results, even compared with non-bandit online algorithms, especially when label noise is introduced.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Universita' del ... - Varese, Italy"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Koby Crammer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Crammer:Koby", "Claudio Gentile.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gentile:Claudio"], "pages": 8}
