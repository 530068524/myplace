{"title": "Accountable Approval Sorting.", "fields": ["sort", "management science", "machine learning", "sorting", "accountability"], "abstract": "We consider decision situations in which a set of points of view (voters, criteria) are to sort a set of candidates to ordered classes (GOOD / BAD). Candidates are judged GOOD when approved by a sufficient set of points of view; this corresponds to noncompensatory sorting. To be accountable, such approval sorting should provide guarantees about the decision process and decisions concerning specific candidates. We formalize accountability using a feasibility problem expressed as a boolean satisfi-ability formulation. We illustrate different forms of accountability when a committee decides with approval sorting and study the information that should be disclosed by the committee.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "Paris Dauphine University", "University of Paris", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "Thales Reserach ... laiseau, France"], "authors": ["Khaled Belahc\u00e8ne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Belahc=egrave=ne:Khaled", "Yann Chevaleyre.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chevaleyre:Yann", "Christophe Labreuche.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Labreuche:Christophe", "Nicolas Maudet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maudet:Nicolas", "Vincent Mousseau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mousseau:Vincent", "Wassila Ouerdane.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouerdane:Wassila"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
