The proposed control method uses geographical information data including weather data, hazard area data, and physical network data. By applying technologies related to meteorology, erosion control, and civil engineering to such data, the proposed method can evaluate the risk of a physical network being disconnected. On the basis of the evaluated risk, the proposed method reconfigures a logical network to reduce service disruption. The proposed method is applied to a cloud computing service network where, in addition to route changes, the relocation of virtual machines is possible, increasing its effectiveness. By using empirical data, we show that the proposed method reduces the probability of service disconnection to almost zero even for heavy rainfall causing landslides. Finally, an experimental system of the proposed method was implemented through software defined network technology and successfully controlled the experimental network.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["NTT Network Technology Labs", "NTT Network Technology Labs", "NTT Network Technology Labs"], "authors": ["Hiroshi Saito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saito:Hiroshi", "Hirotada Honda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Honda:Hirotada", "Ryoichi Kawahara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawahara:Ryoichi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
