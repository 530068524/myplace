An \u201corganic\u201d RF positioning system relies on regular users, not dedicated surveyors, to build the map of RF fingerprints to location labels. However, signal variation due to device heterogeneity may degrade localization performance. We analyze the diversity of those signal characteristics pertinent to indoor localization \u2014 signal strength and AP detection \u2014 as measured by a variety of 802.11 devices. We first analyze signal strength diversity, and show that pairwise linear transformation alone does not solve the problem. We propose kernel estimation with a wide kernel width to reduce the difference in probability estimates. We also investigate diversity in access point detection. We demonstrate that localization performance may degrade significantly when AP detection rate is used as a feature for localization, and correlate the loss of performance to a device dissimilarity measure captured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. Based on this analysis, we show that using only signal strength, without incorporating negative evidence, achieves good localization performance when devices are heterogeneous.", "citation": "Citations (136)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Nokia"], "authors": ["Jun-geun Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jun=geun", "Dorothy Curtis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Curtis:Dorothy", "Seth J.
