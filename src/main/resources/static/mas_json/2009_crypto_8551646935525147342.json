{"title": "Computational Differential Privacy.", "fields": ["theoretical computer science", "equivalence", "discrete mathematics", "computer science", "differential privacy"], "abstract": "The definition of differential privacy has recently emerged as a leading standard of privacy guarantees for algorithms on statistical databases. We offer several relaxations of the definition which require privacy guarantees to hold only against efficient--i.e., computationally-bounded--adversaries. We establish various relationships among these notions, and in doing so, we observe their close connection with the theory of pseudodense sets by Reingold et al.[1]. We extend the dense model theorem of Reingold et al. to demonstrate equivalence between two definitions (indistinguishability- and simulatability-based) of computational differential privacy.\n\nOur computational analogues of differential privacy seem to allow for more accurate constructions than the standard information-theoretic analogues. In particular, in the context of private approximation of the distance between two vectors, we present a differentially-private protocol for computing the approximation, and contrast it with a substantially more accurate protocol that is only computationally differentially private.", "citation": "Citations (155)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of California, Los Angeles", "Weizmann Institute of Science", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Ilya Mironov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mironov:Ilya", "Omkant Pandey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pandey:Omkant", "Omer Reingold.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reingold:Omer", "Salil P.
