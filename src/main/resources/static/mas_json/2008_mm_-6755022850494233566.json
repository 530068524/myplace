{"title": "PicNTell: a camcorder metaphor for screen recording.", "fields": ["metaphor", "non linear editing system", "multimedia", "video editing", "computer graphics images"], "abstract": "PicNTell is a new technique for generating compelling screencasts where users can quickly record desktop activities and generate videos that are embeddable on popular video sharing distributions such as YouTube\u00ae. While standard video editing and screen capture tools are useful for some editing tasks, they have two main drawbacks: (1) they require users to import and organize media in a separate interface, and (2) they do not support natural (or camcorder-like) screen recording, and instead usually require the user to define a specific region or window to record. In this paper we review current screen recording use, and present the PicNTell system, pilot studies, and a new six degree-of-freedom tracker we are developing in response to our findings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["FX Palo Alto Laboratory", "FX Palo Alto Laboratory"], "authors": ["Scott Carter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carter:Scott", "Laurent Denoue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Denoue:Laurent"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
