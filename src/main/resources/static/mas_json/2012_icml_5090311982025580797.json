Although not usually interpreted thus, these are learning algorithms that fit a local quadratic approximation to the objective function. We show that many, including the most popular, quasi-Newton methods can be interpreted as approximations of Bayesian linear regression under varying prior assumptions. This new notion elucidates some shortcomings of classical algorithms, and lights the way to a novel nonparametric quasi-Newton method, which is able to make more efficient use of available information at computational cost similar to its predecessors.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Philipp Hennig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hennig:Philipp", "Martin Kiefel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiefel:Martin"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
