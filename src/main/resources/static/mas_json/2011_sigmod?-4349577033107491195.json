Our user studies show the effectiveness of MOBIES on improving user experience over a hidden web database.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["George Washington University", "University of Texas at Arlington", "George Washington University", "University of Texas at Arlington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Xin Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xin", "Aditya Mone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mone:Aditya", "Nan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Nan", "Gautam Das.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Das_0001:Gautam"], "pages": 4}
