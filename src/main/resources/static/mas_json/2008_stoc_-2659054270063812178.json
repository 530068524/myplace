The \"Inverse Conjecture for the Gowers Norm\" states that if the \"d-th Gowers norm\" of a function f:F N  p  to F p  is non-negligible, that is larger than a constant independent of N, then f has a non-trivial correlation with a degree d-1 polynomial. The conjecture is known to hold for d=2,3 and for any prime p. In this paper we show the conjecture to be false for p=2 and for d=4, by presenting an explicit function whose 4-th Gowers norm is non-negligible, but whose correlation with any polynomial of degree 3 is exponentially small. Essentially the same result, with different bounds for correlation, was independently obtained by Green and Tao. Their analysis uses a modification of a Ramsey-type argument of Alon and Beigel to show inapproximability of certain functions by low-degree polynomials. We observe that a combination of our results with the argument of Alon and Beigel implies the inverse conjecture to be false for any prime p, for d = p 2 .", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Shachar Lovett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lovett:Shachar", "Roy Meshulam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meshulam:Roy", "Alex Samorodnitsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Samorodnitsky:Alex"], "pages": 10}
