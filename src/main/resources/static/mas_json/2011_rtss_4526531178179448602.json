This is known to be intractable (NP-hard in the strong sense). A polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) is proposed for sporadic task systems satisfying the additional constraint that for each of the three parameters -- worst-case execution time, relative deadline, and period -- that characterize sporadic tasks, the ratio of the largest value to the smallest value is bounded from above by a constant.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Sanjoy K.
