Inference is a central problem to be solved on these networks. This, and other problems on these graph models are often known to be hard to solve in general, but tractable on graphs with bounded Treewidth. Therefore, finding or approximating the Treewidth of a graph is a fundamental problem related to inference in graphical models. In this paper, we study the approximability of a number of graph problems: Treewidth and Pathwidth of graphs, Minimum FillIn, and a variety of different graph layout problems such as Minimum Cut Linear Arrangement. We show that, assuming Small Set Expansion Conjecture, all of these problems are NP-hard to approximate to within any constant factor in polynomial time.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Yu Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yu", "Per Austrin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Austrin:Per", "Toniann Pitassi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pitassi:Toniann", "David Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:David"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
