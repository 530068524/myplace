{"title": "Staging User Feedback toward Rapid Conflict Resolution in Data Fusion.", "fields": ["expected value of perfect information", "sensor fusion", "leverage", "data integration", "conflict resolution"], "abstract": "In domains such as the Web, sensor networks and social media, sources often provide conflicting information for the same data item. Several data fusion techniques have been proposed recently to resolve conflicts and identify correct data. The performance of these fusion systems, while quite accurate, is far from perfect. In this paper, we propose to leverage user feedback for validating data conflicts and rapidly improving the performance of fusion. To present the most  beneficial  data items for the user to validate, we take advantage of the level of consensus among sources, and the output of fusion to generate an effective ordering of items. We first evaluate data items individually, and then define a novel decision-theoretic framework based on the concept of value of perfect information (VPI) to order items by their ability to boost the performance of fusion. We further derive approximate formulae to scale up the decision-theoretic framework to large-scale data. We empirically evaluate our algorithms on three real-world datasets with different characteristics, and show that the accuracy of fusion can be significantly improved even while requesting feedback on a few data items. We also show that the performance of the proposed methods depends on the characteristics of data, and assess the trade-off between the amount of feedback acquired, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Bloomberg L.P.", "Purdue University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Romila Pradhan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pradhan:Romila", "Siarhei Bykau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bykau:Siarhei", "Sunil Prabhakar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Prabhakar:Sunil"], "pages": 16}
