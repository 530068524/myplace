The goal is to find a partition S 1 ,..S k  of {1,...n} which maximizes the quantity Sigma i,j=1   k (Sigma (i,j)isinS   i   timesS   j ). We study the computational complexity of this generic clustering problem which originates in the theory of machine learning. We design a constant factor polynomial time approximation algorithm forthis problem, answering a question posed by Song, Smola, Gretton and Borgwardt. In some cases we manage to compute the sharp approximation threshold for this problem assuming the unique games conjecture (UGC). In particular, when B is the 3times3 identity matrix the UGC hardness threshold of this problem is exactly 16pi/27. We present and study a geometricconjecture of independent interest which we show would imply thatthe UGC threshold when B is the ktimesk identity matrix is 8pi/9(1-1/k) for every kges3.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "authors": ["Subhash Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Subhash", "Assaf Naor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naor:Assaf"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
