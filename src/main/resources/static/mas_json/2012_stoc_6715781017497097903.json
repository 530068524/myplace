A Poisson Binomial Distribution (PBD) over {0,1,...,n} is the distribution of a sum of n independent Bernoulli random variables which may have arbitrary, potentially non-equal, expectations. These distributions were first studied by S. Poisson in 1837 and are a natural n-parameter generalization of the familiar Binomial Distribution. Surprisingly, prior to our work this basic learning problem was poorly understood, and known results for it were far from optimal.   We essentially settle the complexity of the learning problem for this basic class of distributions. As our main result we give a highly efficient algorithm which learns to e-accuracy using O(1/e 3 ) samples  independent of n . The running time of the algorithm is  quasilinear  in the size of its input data, i.e. ~O(log(n)/e 3 ) bit-operations (observe that each draw from the distribution is a log(n)-bit string). This is nearly optimal since any algorithm must use \u03a9(1/e 2 ) samples. We also give positive and negative results for some extensions of this learning problem.", "citation": "Citations (70)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of California, Berkeley", "Columbia University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Edinburgh", "Columbia University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Constantinos Daskalakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daskalakis:Constantinos", "Ilias Diakonikolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakonikolas:Ilias", "Rocco A.
