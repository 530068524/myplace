{"title": "Towards Tamper-evident Storage on Patterned Media.", "fields": ["electronic engineering", "magnetization", "patterned media", "computer engineering", "file system", "embedded system", "computer data storage"], "abstract": "We propose a tamper-evident storage system based on probe storage with a patterned magnetic medium. This medium supports normal read/write operations by out-of-plane magnetisation of individual magnetic dots. We report on measurements showing that in principle the medium also supports a separate class of write-once operation that destroys the out-of-plane magnetisation property of the dots irreversibly by precise local heating. We discuss the main issues of designing a tamper-evident storage device and file system using the properties of the medium.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Twente", "University of Twente", "University of Twente", "University of Twente", "University of Twente", "University of Twente"], "authors": ["Pieter H.
