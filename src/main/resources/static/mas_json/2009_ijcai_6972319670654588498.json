We prove that in circumscribed DL-liteR complexity drops from NExpNP to the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. In EL, reasoning remains ExpTime-hard, in general. However, by restricting the possible occurrences of existential restrictions, we obtain membership in \u03a32p and \u03a02p for an extension of EL.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "departments": ["University of Naples Federico II", "University of Naples Federico II", "University of Naples Federico II"], "authors": ["Piero A.
