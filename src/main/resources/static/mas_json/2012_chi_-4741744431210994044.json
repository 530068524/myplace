Based on a study of online practices of Steampunk, we consider how, as a design fiction, Steampunk provides an explicit model for how to physically realize an ideological and imagined world through design practice. We contend that the practices of DIY and appropriation that are evident in Steampunk design provide a useful set of design strategies and implications for HCI.", "citation": "Citations (104)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University", "Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Joshua Tanenbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanenbaum:Joshua", "Karen Tanenbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tanenbaum:Karen", "Ron Wakkary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wakkary:Ron"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
