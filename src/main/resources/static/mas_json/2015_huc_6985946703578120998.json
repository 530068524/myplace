The  SmartGPA study  uses passive sensing data and self-reports from students' smartphones to understand individual behavioral differences between high and low performers during a single 10-week term. We propose new methods for better understanding study (e.g., study duration) and social (e.g., partying) behavior of a group of undergraduates. We show that there are a number of important behavioral factors automatically inferred from smartphones that significantly correlate with term and cumulative GPA, including time series analysis of activity, conversational interaction, mobility, class attendance, studying, and partying. We propose a simple model based on linear regression with lasso regularization that can accurately predict cumulative GPA. The predicted GPA strongly correlates with the ground truth from students' transcripts ( r  = 0:81 and  p", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Dartmouth College", "University of Texas at Austin", "Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College", "Dartmouth College", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Rui Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0016:Rui", "Gabriella M.
