Understanding the brain connectome structure is a very interesting and a challenging problem. It is critical in the research for epilepsy and other neuropathological diseases. We introduce a new deep learning architecture that exploits the spatial and temporal nature of the neuronal activation data. The architecture consists of a combination of Convolutional layer and a Recurrent layer for predicting the connectome of neurons based on their time-series of activation data. The key contribution of this paper is a dynamically programmed layer that is critical in determining the alignment between the neuronal activations of pair-wise combinations of neurons.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "authors": ["Vivek Veeriah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veeriah:Vivek", "Rohit Durvasula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durvasula:Rohit", "Guo-Jun Qi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qi:Guo=Jun"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2015", "pages": 10}
