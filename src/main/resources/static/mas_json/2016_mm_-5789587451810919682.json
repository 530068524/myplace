We first propose a multilayer strategy to simultaneously capture a variety of levels of abstraction and invariance in a network, where the convolutional and fully connected layers are effectively represented by our proposed feature aggregation methods. We further introduce a multimodal scheme that includes four highly complementary modalities to extract diverse static and dynamic cues at multiple temporal scales. In particular, for modeling the long-term temporal information, we propose a new structure, FC-RNN, to effectively transform pre-trained fully connected layers into recurrent layers. A robust boosting model is then introduced to optimize the fusion of multiple layers and modalities in a unified way. In the extensive experiments, we achieve state-of-the-art results on two public benchmark datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Nvidia", "Nvidia", "Nvidia"], "authors": ["Xiaodong Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiaodong", "Pavlo Molchanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Molchanov:Pavlo", "Jan Kautz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kautz:Jan"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
