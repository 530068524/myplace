Memory seems favored but both of them play a major role in the mind, we want to equilibrate it. Those two components of our cognitive system are actually quite intertwined with sometimes similar properties and goals. Both are failing, in many ways, that is why we are interested in it, a slight augmentation to those abilities would have huge impact. Therefore, we made a first attempt to propose an approach of a system capable of augmenting the reasoning of his user. First by sensing his context and detect a kind of cognitive bias for many domains through wearable devices and natural language processing. Then we propose a radical method to debiasing that could be used in different scenarios thanks to augmented reality. Finally, those propositions are a beginning of a much needed bigger work that confronts many challenges discussed at the end.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["T\u00e9l\u00e9-universit\u00e9", "T\u00e9l\u00e9-universit\u00e9", "UBL, Universit\u00e9 ... u Maine, France"], "authors": ["Damien Brun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brun:Damien", "Charles Gouin-Vallerand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gouin=Vallerand:Charles", "S\u00e9bastien George.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/George:S=eacute=bastien"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
