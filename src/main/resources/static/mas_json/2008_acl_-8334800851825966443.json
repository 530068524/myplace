{"title": "Trainable Generation of Big-Five Personality Styles through Data-Driven Parameter Estimation.", "fields": ["politeness", "naturalness", "grammaticality", "data driven", "big five personality traits"], "abstract": "Previous work on statistical language generation has primarily focused on grammaticality and naturalness, scoring generation possibilities according to a language model or user feedback. More recent work has investigated data-driven techniques for controlling linguistic style without overgeneration, by reproducing variation dimensions extracted from corpora. Another line of work has produced handcrafted rule-based systems to control specific stylistic dimensions, such as politeness and personality. This paper describes a novel approach that automatically learns to produce recognisable variation along a meaningful stylistic dimension\u2014 personality\u2014without the computational cost incurred by overgeneration techniques. We present the first evaluation of a data-driven generation method that projects multiple personality traits simultaneously and on a continuous scale. We compare our performance to a rule-based generator in the same domain.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Sheffield"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois Mairesse.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mairesse:Fran=ccedil=ois", "Marilyn A.
