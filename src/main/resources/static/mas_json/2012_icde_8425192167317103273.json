{"title": "A Deep Embedding of Queries into Ruby.", "fields": ["code generation", "active record pattern", "digital subscriber line", "embedding", "sql"], "abstract": "We demonstrate SWITCH, a deep embedding of relational queries into Ruby and Ruby on Rails. With SWITCH, there is no syntactic or stylistic difference between Ruby programs that operate over in-memory array objects or database-resident tables, even if these programs rely on array order or nesting. SWITCH's built-in compiler and SQL code generator guarantee to emit few queries, addressing long-standing performance problems that trace back to Rails' Active Record database binding. \"Looks likes Ruby, but performs like handcrafted SQL, \" is the ideal that drives the research and development effort behind SWITCH.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Dept. of Comput ... bingen, Germany", "Dept. of Comput ... bingen, Germany"], "authors": ["Torsten Grust.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grust:Torsten", "Manuel Mayr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayr:Manuel"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
