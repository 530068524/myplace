Our map is built upon the recent development of fiducial markers, specifically, the random dot markers. We propose a simple solution, i.e., using a grid of compound markers, to address the scalability problem. Our highly scalable approach is able to generate a middle-scale map on which multiple players can stand and position themselves via mobile cameras in real time. We show how a classic computer game can be effectively adapted to our middle-scale gaming platform.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "City University of Hong Kong", "City University of Hong Kong", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Lu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lu", "Hongbo Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Hongbo", "Wing Ho Andy Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wing_Ho_Andy", "Chiew-Lan Tai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tai:Chiew=Lan"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
