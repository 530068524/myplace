{"title": "An Attribute-aware Neural Attentive Model for Next Basket Recommendation.", "fields": ["hierarchy", "product category", "recurrent neural network", "do not track", "in basket test"], "abstract": "Next basket recommendation is a new type of recommendation, which recommends a set of items, or a basket, to the user. Purchase in basket is a common behavior of consumers. Recently, deep neural networks have been applied to model sequential transactions of baskets in next basket recommendation. However, current methods do not track the user's evolving appetite for items explicitly, and they ignore important item attributes such as product category. In this paper, we propose a novel Attribute-aware Neural Attentive Model (ANAM) to address these problems. ANAM adopts an attention mechanism to explicitly model user's evolving appetite for items, and utilizes a hierarchical architecture to incorporate the attribute information. In specific, ANAM utilizes a recurrent neural network to model the user's sequential behavior over time, and relays the user's appetite toward items and their attributes to next basket through attention weights shared across baskets on the two different hierarchies. Experiment results on two public datasets (ie Ta-Feng and JingDong) demonstrate the effectiveness of our ANAM model for next basket recommendation.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Renmin University of China", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "Renmin University of China", "Renmin University of China", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], "authors": ["Ting Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Ting", "Jian-Yun Nie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nie:Jian=Yun", "Wayne Xin Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Wayne_Xin", "Yutao Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Yutao", "Pan Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Pan", "Ji-Rong Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Ji=Rong"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2018", "pages": 4}
