{"title": "Understanding Design Tradeoffs for Health Technologies: A Mixed-Methods Approach.", "fields": ["health technology", "data model", "unstructured data", "design science", "health informatics"], "abstract": "We introduce a mixed-methods approach for determining how people weigh tradeoffs in values related to health and technologies for health self-management. Our approach combines interviews with Q-methodology, a method from psychology uniquely suited to quantifying opinions. We derive the framework for structured data collection and analysis for the Q-methodology from theories of self-management of chronic illness and technology adoption. To illustrate the power of this new approach, we used it in a field study of nine older adults with type 2 diabetes, and nine mothers of children with asthma. Our mixed-methods approach provides three key advantages for health design science in HCI: (1) it provides a structured health sciences theoretical framework to guide data collection and analysis; (2) it enhances the coding of unstructured data with statistical patterns of polarizing and consensus views; and (3) it empowers participants to actively weigh competing values that are most personally significant to them.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "Group Health Research Institute"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Katie O'Leary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Leary:Katie", "Jordan Eschler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eschler:Jordan", "Logan Kendall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kendall:Logan", "Lisa M.
