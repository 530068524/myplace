It will be shown that, under this representation, the nonmonotonic semantics of the causal calculus describes precisely the solutions of the structural equations (the causal worlds of a causal model), while the causal logic from Bochman (2004) is adequate for describing the behavior of causal models under interventions (forming submodels).", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Holon Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Alexander Bochman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bochman:Alexander", "Vladimir Lifschitz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lifschitz:Vladimir"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
