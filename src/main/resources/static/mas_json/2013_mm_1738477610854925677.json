There are lots of different test data sets, lots of published methods and techniques, and manifold retrieval challenges, where content based image retrieval is of interest. LIRE is a Java library, that provides a simple way to index and retrieve millions of images based on the images' contents. LIRE is robust and well tested and is not only recommended by the websites of ImageCLEF and MediaEval, but is also employed in industry. This paper gives an overview on LIRE, its use, capabilities and reports on retrieval and runtime performance.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Klagenfurt Univ ... enfurt, Austria"], "authors": ["Mathias Lux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lux:Mathias"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
