Analyzing such fixes manually, we found that a large percentage of them occurs in  code peers , the classes/methods having the similar roles in the systems, such as providing similar functions and/or participating in similar object interactions. Based on graph-based representation of object usages, we have developed several techniques to identify code peers, recognize recurring bug fixes, and recommend changes for code units from the bug fixes of their peers. The empirical evaluation on several open-source projects shows that our prototype, FixWizard, is able to identify recurring bug fixes and provide fixing recommendations with acceptable accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (109)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Tung Thanh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Tung_Thanh", "Hoan Anh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Hoan_Anh", "Nam H.
