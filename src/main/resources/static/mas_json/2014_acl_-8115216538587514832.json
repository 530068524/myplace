{"title": "Modelling Events through Memory-based, Open-IE Patterns for Abstractive Summarization.", "fields": ["parsing", "data structure", "sentence", "abstraction", "automatic summarization"], "abstract": "Abstractive text summarization of news requires a way of representing events, such as a collection of pattern clusters in which every cluster represents an event (e.g., marriage) and every pattern in the clus- ter is a way of expressing the event (e.g., X married Y, X and Y tied the knot). We compare three ways of extracting event patterns: heuristics-based, compression- based and memory-based. While the for- mer has been used previously in multi- document abstraction, the latter two have never been used for this task. Compared with the first two techniques, the memory- based method allows for generating sig- nificantly more grammatical and informa- tive sentences, at the cost of searching a vast space of hundreds of millions of parse trees of known grammatical utterances. To this end, we introduce a data structure and a search method that make it possible to efficiently extrapolate from every sentence the parse sub-trees that match against any of the stored utterances.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Trento", "Autonomous University of Madrid", "Google"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Daniele Pighin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pighin:Daniele", "Marco Cornolti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cornolti:Marco", "Enrique Alfonseca.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alfonseca:Enrique", "Katja Filippova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filippova:Katja"], "pages": 10}
