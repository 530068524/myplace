Traditional studies represent one video clip with a flat feature vector; however, video data usually has natural structure. Moreover, a video clip is generally relevant to multiple concepts. Indeed, the video annotation task is inherently a Multi-Instance Multi-Label (MIML) learning problem. In this paper, we propose the En-MIMLSVM approach for the video annotation task. It considers the class imbalance and long time training problems of most video annotation tasks. In addition, a temporally consistent weighted multi-instance kernel is developed to take into account both the temporal consistency in video data and the significance of instances of different levels in pyramid representation. The En-MIMLSVM is evaluated on TRECVID 2005 data set, and the results show that it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "departments": ["Shandong University", "Fudan University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Xin-Shun Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Xin=Shun", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
