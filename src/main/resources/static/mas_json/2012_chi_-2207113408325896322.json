{"title": "CapStones and ZebraWidgets: sensing stacks of building blocks, dials and sliders on capacitive touch screens.", "fields": ["capacitive sensing", "touchscreen", "moving parts", "stack", "capacitance"], "abstract": "Recent research proposes augmenting capacitive touch pads with tangible objects, enabling a new generation of mobile applications enhanced with tangible objects, such as game pieces and tangible controllers. In this paper, we extend the concept to capacitive tangibles consisting of multiple parts, such as stackable gaming pieces and tangible widgets with moving parts. We achieve this using a system of wires and connectors inside each block that causes the capacitance of the bottom-most block to reflect the entire assembly. We demonstrate three types of tangibles, called  CapStones ,  Zebra Dials  and  Zebra Sliders  that work with current consumer hardware and investigate what designs may become possible as touchscreen hardware evolves.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "departments": ["Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner Institute", "Hasso Plattner  ... otsdam, Germany", "Hasso Plattner  ... otsdam, Germany"], "authors": ["Liwei Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Liwei", "Stefanie M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:Stefanie", "Anne Roudaut.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roudaut:Anne", "Patrick Baudisch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baudisch:Patrick"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
