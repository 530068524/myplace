These tools report statements ranked in order of suspiciousness. Unfortunately, the reported statements can often be unrelated to the error. This paper evaluates the impact of several approaches to ignoring such unrelated statements in order to improve the effectiveness of fault-localization tools.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Federal University of Pernambuco", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Federal University of Pernambuco"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Elton Alves.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alves:Elton", "Milos Gligoric.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gligoric:Milos", "Vilas Jagannath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jagannath:Vilas", "Marcelo d'Amorim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/d=Amorim:Marcelo"], "pages": 4}
