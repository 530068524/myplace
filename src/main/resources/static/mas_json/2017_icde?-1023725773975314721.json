{"title": "Secure and Efficient Query Processing over Hybrid Clouds.", "fields": ["encryption", "cloud computing", "data modeling", "outsourcing", "data management"], "abstract": "This paper explores secure data processing in hybrid clouds wherein local computing capability is exploited alongside public cloud services to deliver an efficient and secure data management solution. Hybrid clouds offer numerous advantages including the ability to selectively outsource data and computations based on sensitivity/confidentiality. Data processing in hybrid clouds must address two interrelated challenges: (i) data distribution: how is data distributed across public and private machines, and (ii) distributed query processing: how are queries executed efficiently without leaking sensitive data to untrusted public machines. This paper addresses these challenges and incorporates the respective solutions into an add-on tool for a Hadoop, Spark, and Hive based cloud computing infrastructure. Our results show performance advantages in using our strategy as compared to other secure alternatives, even when the percentage of sensitive data is as high as 50%.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "UT System Cyber ... rity Initiative"], "authors": ["Kerim Yasin Oktay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oktay:Kerim_Yasin", "Murat Kantarcioglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kantarcioglu:Murat", "Sharad Mehrotra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mehrotra:Sharad"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
