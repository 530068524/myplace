We achieve this result by applying phrasal inversion transduction grammar alignment techniques to character strings to train a character-based translation model, and using this in the phrase-based MT framework. We also propose a look-ahead parsing algorithm and substring-informed prior probabilities to achieve more effective and efficient alignment. In an evaluation, we demonstrate that character-based translation can achieve results that compare to word-based systems while effectively translating unknown and uncommon words over several language pairs.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "Kyoto University", "Kyoto University", "National Instit ... , Kyoto, Japan"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Graham Neubig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Neubig:Graham", "Taro Watanabe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Watanabe:Taro", "Shinsuke Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Shinsuke", "Tatsuya Kawahara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawahara:Tatsuya"], "pages": 10}
