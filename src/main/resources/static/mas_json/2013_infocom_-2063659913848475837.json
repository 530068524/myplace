We assume limited buffer size available at each node and Zipf-like content popularity. We consider nodes uniformly visiting the network area according to a random-walk mobility model, whose flight size varies from the typical distance among the nodes (quasi-static case) up to the edge length of the network area (reshuffling mobility model). Our main findings are: 1) the best throughput-delay tradeoffs are achieved in the quasi-static case: increasing the mobility degree of nodes leads to worse and worse performance; ii) the best throughput-delay tradeoffs can be recovered by power control (i.e., by adapting the transmission range to the content) even in the complete reshuffling case.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Turin", "University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "Dipt. di Elettr ... o, Turin, Italy", "Dipt. di Inf.,  ... o, Turin, Italy", "Dipt. di Elettr ... o, Turin, Italy"], "authors": ["Giuseppa Alfano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alfano:Giuseppa", "Michele Garetto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garetto:Michele", "Emilio Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Emilio"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
