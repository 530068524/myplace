One popular way to construct a quality virtual backbone is to solve the minimum connected dominating set problem. However, a virtual backbone computed in this way is not resilient against topology change since the induced graph by the connected dominating set is one-vertex-connected. As a result, the minimum k-connected m-dominating set problem is introduced to construct a fault-tolerant virtual backbone. Currently, the best known approximation algorithm for the problem in unit disk graph assumes k \u2264 3 and m \u2265 1 and its performance ratio is 280 when k = m = 3. In this paper, we use a classical result from graph theory, Tutte decomposition, to design a new approximation algorithm for the problem in unit disk graph for k \u2264 3 and m \u2265 3. In particular, the algorithm features with much simpler structure and much smaller performance ratio, e.g. nearly 66 when k = m = 3. We also conduct simulation to evaluate the performance of our algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Xi'an Jiaotong University", "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "North Carolina Central University", "Renmin University of China", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Wei Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0032:Wei", "Bei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Bei", "Donghyun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Donghyun", "Deying Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Deying", "Jingyi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingyi", "Yaolin Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Yaolin"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
