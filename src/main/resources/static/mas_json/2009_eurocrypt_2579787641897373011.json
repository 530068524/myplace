We extend results of Iijima, Matsuo, Chao and Tsujii which give such homomorphisms for a large class of elliptic curves by working over ${\\mathbb F}_{p^2}$ and demonstrate that these results can be applied to the GLV method.\n\nIn general we expect our method to require about 0.75 the time of previous best methods (except for subfield curves, for which Frobenius expansions can be used). We give detailed implementation results which show that the method runs in between 0.70 and 0.84 the time of the previous best methods for elliptic curve point multiplication on general curves.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Royal Holloway, University of London", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Dublin City University", "University of Auckland", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Dublin City University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Steven D.
