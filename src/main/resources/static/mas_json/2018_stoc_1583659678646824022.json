A learner tries to learn  x  from a stream of samples, ( a  1 ,  b  1 ), ( a  2 ,  b  2 ) \u2026, where for every  i ,  a   i   \u2208  A  is chosen uniformly at random and  b   i   =  M ( a   i  , x ).    Assume that  k ,  l ,  r  are such that any submatrix of  M  of at least 2 \u2212 k   \u00b7 | A | rows and at least 2 \u2212 l   \u00b7 | X | columns, has a bias of at most 2 \u2212 r  . We show that any learning algorithm for the learning problem corresponding to  M  requires either a memory of size at least \u03a9( k  \u00b7  l  ), or at least 2 \u03a9( r )  samples. The result holds even if the learner has an exponentially small success probability (of 2 \u2212\u03a9( r ) ).    In particular, this shows that for a large class of learning problems, any learning algorithm requires either a memory of size at least \u03a9((log| X |) \u00b7 (log| A |)) or an exponential number of samples, achieving a tight \u03a9((log| X |) \u00b7 (log| A |)) lower bound on the size of the memory, rather than a bound of \u03a9(min{(log| X |) 2 ,(log| A |) 2 }) obtained in previous works by Raz [FOCS\u201917] and Moshkovitz and Moshkovitz [ITCS\u201918].    Moreover, our result implies all previous memory-samples lower bounds, as well as a number of new applications.    Our proof builds on the work of Raz [FOCS\u201917] that gave a general technique for proving memory samples lower bounds.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Sumegha Garg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garg:Sumegha", "Ran Raz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raz:Ran", "Avishay Tal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tal:Avishay"], "pages": 13}
