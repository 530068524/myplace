{"title": "On the accuracy of l1-filtering of signals with block-sparse structure.", "fields": ["oracle", "filter", "estimator", "inequality", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We discuss new methods for the recovery of signals with block-sparse structure, based on l1-minimization. Our emphasis is on the efficiently computable error bounds for the recovery routines. We optimize these bounds with respect to the method parameters to construct the estimators with improved statistical properties. We justify the proposed approach with an oracle inequality which links the properties of the recovery algorithms and the best estimation performance.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Space Research Institute", "LJK, Universit\u00e9 ... enoble, France"], "authors": ["Anatoli Iouditski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iouditski:Anatoli", "Fatma Kilin\u00e7-Karzan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kilin=ccedil==Karzan:Fatma", "Arkadi Nemirovski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nemirovski:Arkadi", "Boris T.
