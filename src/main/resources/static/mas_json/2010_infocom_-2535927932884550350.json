{"title": "The Capacity of Ad Hoc Networks with Heterogeneous Traffic Using Cooperation.", "fields": ["unicast", "mutual fund separation theorem", "throughput", "sink", "mimo"], "abstract": "We study the scaling laws for wireless ad hoc networks in which the distribution of $n$ nodes in the network is homogeneous but the traffic they carry is heterogeneous. More specifically, we consider the case in which a given node is the data-gathering sink for $k$ sources sending different information to it, while the rest of the $s= n - k$ nodes participate in unicast sessions with random destinations chosen uniformly. We present a separation theorem for heterogeneous traffic showing that the optimum order throughput capacity can be attained in a wireless network in which traffic classes are distributed uniformly by endowing each node with multiple radios, each operating in a separate orthogonal channel, and by allocating a radio per node to each traffic class. Based on this theorem, we show how this order capacity can be attained for the unicast and data-gathering traffic classes by extending cooperative communication schemes that have been proposed previously.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "University of California, Santa Cruz"], "authors": ["Mingyue Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Mingyue", "Zheng Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0006:Zheng", "Hamid R.
