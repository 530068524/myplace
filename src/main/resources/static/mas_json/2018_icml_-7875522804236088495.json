{"title": "Transformation Autoregressive Networks.", "fields": ["anomaly detection", "discriminative model", "chain rule", "density estimation", "synthetic data"], "abstract": "The fundamental task of general density estimation has been of keen interest to machine learning. Recent advances in density estimation have either: a) proposed using a flexible model to estimate the conditional factors of the chain rule; or b) used flexible, non-linear transformations of variables of a simple base distribution. Instead, this work jointly leverages transformations of variables and autoregressive conditional models, and proposes novel methods for both. We provide a deeper understanding of our models, showing a considerable improvement with our methods through a comprehensive study over both real world and synthetic data. Moreover, we illustrate the use of our models in outlier detection and image modeling task.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Learning"], "authors": ["Junier B.
