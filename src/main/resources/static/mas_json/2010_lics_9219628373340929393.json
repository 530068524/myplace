{"title": "Equality Is Typable in Semi-full Pure Type Systems.", "fields": ["judgement", "open problem", "subject reduction", "dependent type", "proof assistant"], "abstract": "There are two usual ways to describe equality in a dependent typing system, one that uses an external notion of computation like beta-reduction, and one that introduces a typed judgement of beta-equality directly in the typing system. After being an open problem for some time, the general equivalence between both approaches has been solved by Adams for a class of pure type systems (PTSs) called functional. In this paper, we relax the functionality constraint and prove the equivalence for all semi-full PTSs by combining the ideas of Adams with a study of the general shape of types in PTSs. As one application, an extension of this result to systems with sub-typing would be a first step toward bringing closer the theory behind a proof assistant such as Coq to its implementation.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "authors": ["Vincent Siles.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siles:Vincent", "Hugo Herbelin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herbelin:Hugo"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
