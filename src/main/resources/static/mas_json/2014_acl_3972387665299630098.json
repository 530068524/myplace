We propose three new unsupervised models to discover latent structures in task-oriented dialogues. Our methods synthesize hidden Markov models (for underlying state) and topic models (to connect words to states). We apply them to two real, non-trivial datasets: human-computer spoken dialogues in bus query service, and humanhuman text-based chats from a live technical support service. We show that our models extract meaningful state representations and dialogue structures consistent with human annotations. Quantitatively, we show our models achieve superior performance on held-out log likelihood evaluation and an ordering task.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "Microsoft"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ke Zhai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhai_0001:Ke", "Jason D.
