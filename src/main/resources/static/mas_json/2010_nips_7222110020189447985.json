{"title": "Unsupervised Kernel Dimension Reduction.", "fields": ["kernel", "cluster analysis", "dimensionality reduction", "embedding", "visualization"], "abstract": "We apply the framework of kernel dimension reduction, originally designed for supervised problems, to unsupervised dimensionality reduction. In this framework, kernel-based measures of independence are used to derive low-dimensional representations that maximally capture information in covariates in order to predict responses. We extend this idea and develop similarly motivated measures for unsupervised problems where covariates and responses are the same. Our empirical studies show that the resulting compact representation yields meaningful and appealing visualization and clustering of data. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with supervised learners for classification, our methods lead to lower classification errors than state-of-the-art methods, especially when embedding data in spaces of very few dimensions.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Meihong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Meihong", "Fei Sha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sha:Fei", "Michael I.
