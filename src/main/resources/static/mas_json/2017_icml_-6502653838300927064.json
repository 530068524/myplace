{"title": "Algorithms for $\\ell_p$ Low-Rank Approximation.", "fields": ["combinatorics", "singular value decomposition", "low rank approximation", "matrix", "approximation algorithm"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of approximating a given matrix by a low-rank matrix so as to minimize the entrywise $\\ell_p$-approximation error, for any $p \\geq 1$; the case $p = 2$ is the classical SVD problem. We obtain the first provably good approximation algorithms for this version of low-rank approximation that work for every value of $p \\geq 1$, including $p = \\infty$. Our algorithms are simple, easy to implement, work well in practice, and illustrate interesting tradeoffs between the approximation quality, the running time, and the rank of the approximating matrix.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Google", "Yahoo!", "Google", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Flavio Chierichetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chierichetti:Flavio", "Sreenivas Gollapudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gollapudi:Sreenivas", "Ravi Kumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kumar_0001:Ravi", "Silvio Lattanzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lattanzi:Silvio", "Rina Panigrahy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panigrahy:Rina", "David P.
