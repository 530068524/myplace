Instead of relying on rigid black-box inference algorithms hard-coded into the language implementation as in previous probabilistic programming languages, infer- ence metaprogramming enables developers to 1) dynamically decompose inference problems into subproblems, 2) apply in- ference tactics to subproblems, 3) alternate between incorpo- rating new data and performing inference over existing data, and 4) explore multiple execution traces of the probabilis- tic program at once. Implemented tactics include gradient- based optimization, Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational inference, and sequental Monte Carlo techniques. Inference metaprogramming enables the concise expression of proba- bilistic models and inference algorithms across diverse elds, such as computer vision, data science, and robotics, within a single probabilistic programming language.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Google"], "authors": ["Vikash K.
