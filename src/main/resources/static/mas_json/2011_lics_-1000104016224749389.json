We prove that this semantics is adequate for a probabilistic extension of the untyped $\\lambda$-calculus: the probability that a term reduces to ahead normal form is equal to its denotation computed on a suitable set of values. The result gives, in a probabilistic setting, a quantitative refinement to the adequacy of Scott's model for untyped $\\lambda$-calculus.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Lab.
