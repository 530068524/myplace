Although different comparison metrics have been proposed, there are situations in which automatic or pre-configured approaches do not provide reasonable results. Especially when models contain semantic similarities or differences, additional human knowledge is often required. However, only few approaches tackle the problem of how to support humans when comparing models.   In this paper, we propose a tool for interactive model comparison. Its design was informed by a set of guidelines that we identified in previous work. In particular, our prototype leverages visual dataflow programming to allow users to implement custom comparison strategies. To this end, they can combine metrics and graph operations to compute similarities and differences, and use color coding to visualize the gained results. Additionally, a qualitative user study allowed to assess whether and how our tool facilitates iterative exploration of similarities and differences between models.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Trier", "University of Trier"], "authors": ["Rainer Lutz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lutz:Rainer", "Stephan Diehl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diehl_0001:Stephan"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
