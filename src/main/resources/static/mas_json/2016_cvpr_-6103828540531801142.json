{"title": "Unconstrained Salient Object Detection via Proposal Subset Optimization.", "fields": ["object detection", "computer vision", "salient", "compact space", "maximum a posteriori estimation"], "abstract": "We aim at detecting salient objects in unconstrained images. In unconstrained images, the number of salient objects (if any) varies from image to image, and is not given. We present a salient object detection system that directly outputs a compact set of detection windows, if any, for an input image. Our system leverages a Convolutional-Neural-Network model to generate location proposals of salient objects. Location proposals tend to be highly overlapping and noisy. Based on the Maximum a Posteriori principle, we propose a novel subset optimization framework to generate a compact set of detection windows out of noisy proposals. In experiments, we show that our subset optimization formulation greatly enhances the performance of our system, and our system attains 16-34% relative improvement in Average Precision compared with the state-of-the-art on three challenging salient object datasets.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Boston University", "Boston University", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jianming Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jianming", "Stan Sclaroff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sclaroff:Stan", "Zhe Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin_0001:Zhe", "Xiaohui Shen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Xiaohui", "Brian L.
