However, these techniques are often tedious and cumbersome to use, especially when objects of interest are located far apart. We present the PolyZoom technique where users progressively build hierarchies of focus regions, stacked on each other such that each subsequent level shows a higher magnification. Correlation graphics show the relation between parent and child viewports in the hierarchy. To validate the new technique, we compare it to standard navigation techniques in two user studies, one on multiscale visual search and the other on multifocus interaction. Results show that PolyZoom performs better than current standard techniques.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "authors": ["Waqas Javed.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Javed:Waqas", "Sohaib Ghani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghani:Sohaib", "Niklas Elmqvist.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elmqvist:Niklas"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
