Taking inspiration from other areas of cognitive science, we propose that this is accomplished by harnessing compositionality: complex structure is decomposed into simpler building blocks. We formalize this idea within the framework of Bayesian regression using a grammar over Gaussian process kernels. We show that participants prefer compositional over non-compositional function extrapolations, that samples from the human prior over functions are best described by a compositional model, and that people perceive compositional functions as more predictable than their non-compositional but otherwise similar counterparts. We argue that the compositional nature of intuitive functions is consistent with broad principles of human cognition.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University College London", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "University College London", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Eric Schulz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schulz:Eric", "Josh Tenenbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tenenbaum:Josh", "David K.
