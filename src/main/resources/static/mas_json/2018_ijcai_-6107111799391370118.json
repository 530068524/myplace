{"title": "DeepTravel: a Neural Network Based Travel Time Estimation Model with Auxiliary Supervision.", "fields": ["timestamp", "trajectory", "leverage", "artificial neural network", "heuristic"], "abstract": "Estimating the travel time of a path is of great importance to smart urban mobility. Existing approaches are either based on estimating the time cost of each road segment which are not able to capture many cross-segment complex factors, or designed heuristically in a non-learning-based way which fail to utilize the existing abundant temporal labels of the data, i.e., the time stamp of each trajectory point. In this paper, we leverage on new development of deep neural networks and propose a novel auxiliary supervision model, namely DeepTravel, that can automatically and effectively extract different features, as well as make full use of the temporal labels of the trajectory data. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on real datasets to demonstrate the out-performance of DeepTravel over existing approaches.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Singapore Management University"], "authors": ["Hanyuan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hanyuan", "Hao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0011:Hao", "Weiwei Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Weiwei", "Baihua Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Baihua"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
