{"title": "relifix: Automated Repair of Software Regressions.", "fields": ["genetic programming", "test suite", "test case", "regression testing", "software bug"], "abstract": "Regression occurs when code changes introduce failures in previously passing test cases. As software evolves, regressions may be introduced. Fixing regression errors manually is time-consuming and error-prone. We propose an approach of automated repair of software regressions, called  relifix , that considers the regression repair problem as a problem of reconciling problematic changes. Specifically, we derive a set of code transformations obtained from our manual inspection of 73 real software regressions; this set of code transformations uses syntactical information from changed statements. Regression repair is then accomplished via a search over the code transformation operators -- which operator to apply, and where. Our evaluation compares the repairability of  relifix  with GenProg on 35 real regression errors.  relifix  repairs 23 bugs, while GenProg only fixes five bugs. We also measure the likelihood of both approaches in introducing new regressions given a reduced test suite. Our experimental results shows that our approach is less likely to introduce new regressions than GenProg.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Shin Hwei Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Shin_Hwei", "Abhik Roychoudhury.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roychoudhury:Abhik"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
