Action models represent social actions that affect the knowledge or beliefs of agents in multi-agent systems. In the consideration of action model synthesis, we introduce an extension of the action model logic of Baltag, Moss and Solecki [3] with an action model quantifier, \u2203\u03c6 which stands for \u201cthere is an action model that results in the post-condition \u03c6\u201d. We show that this quantifier is equivalent to the refinement quantifier of van Ditmarsch and French [10], and provide a sound and complete axiomatisation for the resulting logic, along with decidability and expressivity results.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Western Australia"], "authors": ["James Hales.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hales:James"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
