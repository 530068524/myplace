Potential performance improvements could be gained by systematically posing MI-based feature selection as a global optimization problem. A rare attempt at providing a global solution for the MI-based feature selection is the recently proposed Quadratic Programming Feature Selection (QPFS) approach. We point out that the QPFS formulation faces several non-trivial issues, in particular, how to properly treat feature `self-redundancy' while ensuring the convexity of the objective function. In this paper, we take a systematic approach to the problem of global MI-based feature selection. We show how the resulting NP-hard global optimization problem could be efficiently approximately solved via spectral relaxation and semi-definite programming techniques. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of these novel feature selection frameworks.", "citation": "Citations (56)", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "authors": ["Xuan Vinh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Xuan_Vinh", "Jeffrey Chan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chan:Jeffrey", "Simone Romano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romano_0003:Simone", "James Bailey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bailey:James"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
