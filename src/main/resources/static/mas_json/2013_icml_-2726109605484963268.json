PSDTF can be viewed as a natural extension of nonnegative matrix factorization. One of the main problems of PSDTF is that an appropriate number of bases should be given in advance. To solve this problem, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model based on a gamma process that can instantiate only a limited number of necessary bases from the infinitely many bases assumed to exist. We derive a variational Bayesian algorithm for closed-form posterior inference and a multiplicative update rule for maximum-likelihood estimation. We evaluated PSDTF on both synthetic data and real music recordings to show its superiority.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "University of Tokyo", "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology", "The Institute o ... 190-8562, Japan"], "authors": ["Kazuyoshi Yoshii.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshii:Kazuyoshi", "Ryota Tomioka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomioka:Ryota", "Daichi Mochihashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mochihashi:Daichi", "Masataka Goto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goto:Masataka"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
