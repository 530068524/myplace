The key idea is that, at each boosting iteration, we   adaptively   and greedily choose a   base   class. Our experiments on public datasets demonstrate the improvement of  abc-mart  over the original  mart  algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Cornell University"], "authors": ["Ping Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Ping"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2009", "pages": 8}
