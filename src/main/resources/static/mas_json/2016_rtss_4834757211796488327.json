It provides automatic constructions of closed-form quadratic bounds or utilization bounds for a wide range of applications in real-time systems under fixed-priority scheduling. The key of the framework is a k-point schedulability test or a k-point response time analysis that is based on the utilizations and the execution times of k-1 higher-priority tasks. The natural condition of k2Q is a quadratic form for testing the schedulability or analyzing the response time. The response time analysis and the schedulability analysis provided by the framework can be viewed as a ``blackbox'' interface that can result in sufficient utilization-based analysis. Since the framework is independent from the task and platform models, it can be applied to a wide range of applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technical University of Dortmund", "Technical University of Dortmund", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Jian-Jia Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Jian=Jia", "Wen-Hung Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Wen=Hung", "Cong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Cong"], "pages": 12}
