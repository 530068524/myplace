{"title": "Variational Inference for Stick-Breaking Beta Process Priors.", "fields": ["prior probability", "matrix decomposition", "inference", "beta", "factorization"], "abstract": "We present a variational Bayesian inference algorithm for the stick-breaking construction of the beta process. We derive an alternate representation of the beta process that is amenable to variational inference, and present a bound relating the truncated beta process to its infinite counterpart. We assess performance on two matrix factorization problems, using a non-negative factorization model and a linear-Gaussian model.", "citation": "Citations (21)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Duke University", "Princeton University", "Princeton University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["John William Paisley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paisley:John_William", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence", "David M.
