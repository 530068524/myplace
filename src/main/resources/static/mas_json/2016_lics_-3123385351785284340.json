{"title": "The complexity of regular abstractions of one-counter languages.", "fields": ["closure", "nondeterministic finite automaton", "abstraction", "completeness", "alphabet"], "abstract": "We study the computational and descriptional complexity of the following transformation: Given a one-counter automaton (OCA) A, construct a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) B that recognizes an abstraction of the language L(A): its (1) downward closure, (2) upward closure, or (3) Parikh image. For the Parikh image over a fixed alphabet and for the upward and downward closures, we find polynomial-time algorithms that compute such an NFA. For the Parikh image with the alphabet as part of the input, we find a quasi-polynomial time algorithm and prove a completeness result: we construct a sequence of OCA that admits a polynomial-time algorithm iff there is one for all OCA. For all three abstractions, it was previously unknown whether appropriate NFA of sub-exponential size exist.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "Max Planck Society", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "Chennai Mathematical Institute", "Kaiserslautern University of Technology"], "authors": ["Mohamed Faouzi Atig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Atig:Mohamed_Faouzi", "Dmitry Chistikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chistikov:Dmitry", "Piotr Hofman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hofman:Piotr", "K.
