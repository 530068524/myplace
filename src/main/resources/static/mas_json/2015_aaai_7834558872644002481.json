It exploits the individual preference and the characteristic of the items. Tensor factorization techniques have been applied to many applications, such as tag recommendation. Models based on Tucker Decomposition can achieve good performance but require a lot of computation power. On the other hand, models based on Canonical Decomposition can run in linear time and are more feasible for online recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for personalized tag recommendation, which can be considered as a nonlinear extension of Canonical Decomposition. Different from linear tensor factorization, we exploit Gaussian radial basis function to increase the model's capacity. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for tag recommendation on real datasets and perform well even with a small number of features, which verifies that our models can make better use of features.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei"], "authors": ["Xiaomin Fang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fang:Xiaomin", "Rong Pan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pan:Rong", "Guoxiang Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Guoxiang", "Xiuqiang He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Xiuqiang", "Wenyuan Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Wenyuan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
