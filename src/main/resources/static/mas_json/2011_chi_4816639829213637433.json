However, encouraging volunteerism is difficult due to the altruistic nature of volunteer activities and the high resource demand in carrying them out. We have created a Facebook game called \"Farmer's Tale\" to attract and make it easier for people to volunteer. We evaluated people's acceptance to this novel idea and the results revealed great potential in such type of games.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Don Sim Jianqiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jianqiang:Don_Sim", "Xiaojuan Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xiaojuan", "Shengdong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Shengdong", "Jing Ting Khoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khoo:Jing_Ting", "Swee Ling Bay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bay:Swee_Ling", "Zhenhui Jiang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiang:Zhenhui"], "pages": 4}
