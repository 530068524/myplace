Since then the empirical evidence has continued to amass, but formal proofs of this phenomenon have remained elusive. A canonical (and indeed complete) example is the local max-cut problem, for which no polynomial time method is known. In a breakthrough paper, Etscheid and Roglin proved that the  smoothed  complexity of local max-cut is quasi-polynomial, i.e., if arbitrary bounded weights are randomly perturbed, a local maximum can be found in \ufffd   n   O (log n )  steps where \ufffd  is an upper bound on the random edge weight density. In this paper we prove smoothed polynomial complexity for local max-cut, thus confirming that finding local optima for max-cut is much easier than solving it.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Stanford University"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Omer Angel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angel:Omer", "S\u00e9bastien Bubeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bubeck:S=eacute=bastien", "Yuval Peres.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peres:Yuval", "Fan Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Fan"], "pages": 9}
