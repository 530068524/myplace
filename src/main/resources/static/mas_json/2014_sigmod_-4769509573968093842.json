Myria's goal is for users to simply upload their data and for the system to help them be self-sufficient data science experts on their data -- self-serve analytics. Using a web browser, Myria users can upload data, author efficient queries to process and explore the data, and debug correctness and performance issues. Myria queries are executed on a scalable, parallel cluster that uses both state-of-the-art and novel methods for distributed query processing. Our interactive demonstration will guide visitors through an exploration of several key Myria features by interfacing with the live system to analyze big datasets over the web.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Daniel Halperin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halperin:Daniel", "Victor Teixeira de Almeida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Almeida:Victor_Teixeira_de", "Lee Lee Choo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choo:Lee_Lee", "Shumo Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:Shumo", "Paraschos Koutris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koutris:Paraschos", "Dominik Moritz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moritz:Dominik", "Jennifer Ortiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ortiz:Jennifer", "Vaspol Ruamviboonsuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruamviboonsuk:Vaspol", "Jingjing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingjing", "Andrew Whitaker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Whitaker:Andrew", "Shengliang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Shengliang", "Magdalena Balazinska.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balazinska:Magdalena", "Bill Howe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Howe:Bill", "Dan Suciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suciu:Dan"], "pages": 4}
