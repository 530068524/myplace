Technology supported approaches could potentially be used to positively influence food consumption. We present the Nutriflect system, which utilizes users' shopping data to inform them about their long term shopping behavior. In an initial study we conducted structured interviews in grocery stores. Based on the results we implemented a system that visualized a household's collective shopping information via situated displays. The aim was to raise awareness about shopping habits and to enable reflection about nutrition without burdening the users with the manual entry of their eating habits. We evaluated the system in a 4 week field study in 8 households with 21 users. The results indicate that contextually situated displays, showing shopping patterns against personal nutrition goals, can foster a reflective and respectful approach towards better shopping and nutrition.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Wolfgang Reitberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reitberger:Wolfgang", "Wolfgang Spreicer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spreicer:Wolfgang", "Geraldine Fitzpatrick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fitzpatrick:Geraldine"], "pages": 10}
