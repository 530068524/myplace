The unit-bidder constraints (UBC) language allows a bidder to condition a bid on its allocated slot and on the slots allocated to other bidders. We introduce a natural extension of the Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction, the expressive GSP (eGSP) auction, that induces truthful revelation of constraints for a rich subclass of unit-bidder types, namely downward-monotonic UBC. We establish the existence of envy-free Nash equilibrium in eGSP under a further restriction to a subclass of exclusion constraints, for which the standard GSP has no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium results are obtained by reduction to equilibrium analysis for reserve price GSP (Even-Dar et al. 2008). In considering the winner determination problem, which is NP-hard, we bound the approximation ratio for social welfare in eGSP and provide parameterized complexity results.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "Humboldt University of Berlin", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Florin Constantin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Constantin:Florin", "Malvika Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Malvika", "Chien-Chung Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chien=Chung", "David C.
