The nonlinear measurements are assumed contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. Depending on the application, we are either interested in recovering the high-dimensional data from the nonlinear compressive measurements, or performing classification directly based on these measurements. The latter case corresponds to classification based on nonlinearly constituted and noisy features. The nonlinear measurement functions are designed based on constrained mutual-information optimization. New analytic results are developed for the gradient of mutual information in this setting, for arbitrary input-signal statistics. We make connections to kernel-based methods, such as the support vector machine. Encouraging results are presented on multiple datasets, for both signal recovery and classification. The nonlinear approach is shown to be particularly valuable in high-noise scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "University College London", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Liming Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Liming", "Abolfazl Razi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Razi:Abolfazl", "Miguel R.
