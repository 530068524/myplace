This paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork into large-scale infrastructure development in ecology and ocean science and analyses of futurism in science and technology studies to call attention to \"anticipation work\": the practices that cultivate and channel expectations of the future, design pathways into those imaginations, and maintain those visions in the face of a dynamic world. We advance three basic claims: first, that long term technological development and sustainability in science is guided by complex and distributed forms of futurism; second, that all actors (both individual and collective) orient towards the future (at both temporally close and distant scales); and third, that actors engage in complex and skilled forms of anticipation work -- individual and collective, formal and informal -- that guide and shape the present character and experience of collaborative life.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Stephanie B.
