{"title": "alpha-Optimal User Association and Cell Load Balancing in Wireless Networks.", "fields": ["load management", "wimax", "fixed point", "standardization", "load balancing"], "abstract": "In this paper we develop a framework for user association in infrastructure-based wireless networks, specifically focused on flow-level cell load balancing under spatially inhomogeneous traffic distributions. Our work encompasses several different user association policies: rate-optimal, throughput- optimal, delay-optimal, and load-equalizing, which we collectively denote \u03b1-optimal user association. We prove that the optimal load vector \u03c1\u2217 that minimizes a generalized system performance function is the fixed point of a certain mapping. Based on this mapping we propose and analyze an iterative distributed user association policy that adapts to spatial traffic loads and converges to a globally optimal allocation.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "Intel", "Intel"], "authors": ["Hongseok Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Hongseok", "Gustavo de Veciana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Veciana:Gustavo_de", "Xiangying Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Xiangying"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2010", "pages": 5}
