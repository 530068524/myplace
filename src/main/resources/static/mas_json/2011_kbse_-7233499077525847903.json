This paper presents a new technique that can statically verify that an invocation's set of argument names, types, and request method match the constraints of a target interface. An empirical evaluation of the technique shows that it is successful at identifying previously unknown errors in web applications.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Southern California"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["William G.
