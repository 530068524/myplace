{"title": "The AT Effect: How Disability Affects the Perceived Social Acceptability of Head-Mounted Display Use.", "fields": ["optical head mounted display", "wearable computer", "public policy", "multimedia", "emerging technologies"], "abstract": "Wearable computing devices offer new possibilities to increase accessibility and independence for individuals with disabilities. However, the adoption of such devices may be influenced by social factors, and useful devices may not be adopted if they are considered inappropriate to use. While public policy may adapt to support accommodations for assistive technology, emerging technologies may be unfamiliar or unaccepted by bystanders. We surveyed 1200 individuals about the use of a head-mounted display in a public setting, examining how information about the user's disability affected judgments of the social acceptability of the scenario. Our findings reveal that observers considered head-mounted display use more socially acceptable if the device was being used to support a person with a disability.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Halley Profita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Profita:Halley", "Reem Albaghli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Albaghli:Reem", "Leah Findlater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Findlater:Leah", "Paul Jaeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaeger:Paul", "Shaun K.
