{"title": "Automatic Test Generation for LUSTRE/SCADE Programs.", "fields": ["code generation", "lustre", "test data generation", "automatic test pattern generation", "formal verification"], "abstract": "Lustre is a declarative, data-flow language, which is devoted to the specification of synchronous and real-time applications. It ensures efficient code generation and provides formal specification and verification facilities. A graphical tool dedicated to the development of critical embedded systems and often used by industries and professionals is SCADE (Safety Critical Application Development Environment). SCADE is a graphical environment based on the LUSTRE language and it allows the hierarchical definition of the system components and the automatic code generation. This research work is partially concerned with Lutess, a testing environment which automatically transforms formal specifications into test data generators.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of Grenoble"], "authors": ["Virginia Papailiopoulou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papailiopoulou:Virginia"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2008", "pages": 4}
