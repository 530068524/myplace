We present a novel Sensor-assisted Video Encoding (SaVE) method to reduce the computational complexity of motion estimation in H.264/AVC encoders, leveraging accelerometers and digital compasses that are increasingly available on mobile devices. Using these sensors, SaVE calculates the rotational movement of a camera and then infers the global motion in the camera image sensor; it subsequently employs the estimated global motion to simplify the state-of-the-art motion estimation algorithms, UMHS and EPZS used in H.264/AVC encoders. We have constructed a prototype of SaVE and report extensive evaluation of it. Our experimental results show that SaVE can reduce the computations of UMHS and EPZS algorithms by up to 27% and 18%, respectively, while achieving the same or better video quality.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Rice University", "National University of Singapore", "Rice University"], "authors": ["XiaoMing Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:XiaoMing", "Zhendong Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Zhendong", "Ahmad Rahmati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahmati:Ahmad", "Ye Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Ye", "Lin Zhong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhong_0001:Lin"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
