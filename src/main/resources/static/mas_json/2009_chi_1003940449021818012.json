{"title": "Enhancing remote participation in live auctions: an 'intelligent' gavel.", "fields": ["social relation", "common value auction", "valuation", "goods and services", "fine art"], "abstract": "Auctions, both traditional and electronic, are a pervasive social organisation for the valuation and exchange of goods and services. Despite the long-standing interest in integrating internet contributions into the more traditional auction such initiatives have remained problematic. We consider the organization of interaction of sales of fine art and antiques and develop a prototype 'intelligent' gavel system that is designed to enhance remote participation and ease the flexible ways in which internet contributions are legitimately integrated into live auctions. We present the findings of a quasi-naturalistic experiment involving the use of the system by auctioneers and its consequences for the general development of technologies to support internet participation in live co-located events.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["King's College London", "King's College London", "King's College London", "University of Tsukuba", "University of Tsukuba"], "authors": ["Christian Heath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heath:Christian", "Paul Luff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luff:Paul", "Dirk vom Lehn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehn:Dirk_vom", "Jun Yamashita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamashita:Jun", "Hideaki Kuzuoka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuzuoka:Hideaki"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
