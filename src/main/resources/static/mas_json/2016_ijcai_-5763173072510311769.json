For example, a neural network might give an image of a dog the probability of one in a million of being a cat but it is still much larger than the probability of being a car. To reveal the hidden structure in them, we apply two unsupervised learning algorithms, PCA and ICA, to the outputs of a deep Convolutional Neural Network trained on the ImageNet of 1000 classes. The PCA/ICA embedding of the object classes reveals their visual similarity and the PCA/ICA components can be interpreted as common visual features shared by similar object classes. For an application, we proposed a new zero-shot learning method, in which the visual features learned by PCA/ICA are employed. Our zero-shot learning method achieves the state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet of over 20000 classes.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yao Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Yao"], "pages": 7}
