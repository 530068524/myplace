The proposed method does not require color calibration of a camera-projector pair and may be used for reconstruction of both dynamic and static scenes. The method uses a structured light pattern that is a combination of a De Bruijn color sequence and of a sinusoidal fringe. For dynamic scenes a Hessian ridge detector and a Gaussian mixture model are combined to extract stripe centers and to identify color. Stripes are then uniquely identified using dynamic programming based on the Smith-Waterman algorithm and a De Bruijn window property. For static scenes phase-shifting and De Bruijn window property are combined to obtain a high accuracy reconstruction. We have tested the proposed method on multiple objects with challenging surfaces and different albedos that demonstrate usability and robustness of the method.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Zagreb", "University of Zagreb", "University of Zagreb"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Matea Donlic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Donlic:Matea", "Tomislav Petkovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petkovic:Tomislav", "Tomislav Pribanic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pribanic:Tomislav"], "pages": 9}
