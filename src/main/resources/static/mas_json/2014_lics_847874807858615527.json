Capturing weak second-order logic with such a restricted form of separation logic requires substantial updates to known proof techniques. We develop these, and as a by-product identify the smallest fragment of separation logic known to be undecidable: first-order separation logic with one record field, two variables, and no separating conjunction.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "New York University"], "authors": ["St\u00e9phane Demri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demri:St=eacute=phane", "Morgan Deters.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deters:Morgan"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
