{"title": "Poisson Process Jumping between an Unknown Number of Rates: Application to Neural Spike Data.", "fields": ["inhomogeneous poisson process", "chinese restaurant process", "markov chain monte carlo", "jumping", "synthetic data"], "abstract": "We introduce a model where the rate of an inhomogeneous Poisson process is modified by a Chinese restaurant process. Applying a MCMC sampler to this model allows us to do posterior Bayesian inference about the number of states in Poisson-like data. Our sampler is shown to get accurate results for synthetic data and we apply it to V1 neuron spike data to find discrete firing rate states depending on the orientation of a stimulus.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin", "Technical University of Berlin"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Florian Stimberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stimberg:Florian", "Andreas Ruttor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruttor:Andreas", "Manfred Opper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Opper:Manfred"], "pages": 9}
