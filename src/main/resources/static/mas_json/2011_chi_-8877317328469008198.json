Viz-A-Vis visualizes behavior as aggregate motion over observation space. In this paper, we present two complementary user studies of Viz-A-Vis measuring its performance and discovery affordances. First, we present a controlled user study aimed at comparatively measuring behavioral analysis preference and performance for observation and search tasks. Second, we describe a study with architects measuring discovery affordances and potential impacts on their work practices. We conclude: 1) Viz-A-Vis significantly reduced search time; and 2) it increased the number and quality of insightful discoveries.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Mario Romero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Romero:Mario", "Alice Vialard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vialard:Alice", "John Peponis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Peponis:John", "John T.
