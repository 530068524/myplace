By rotating a flat-panel display whose viewing angle is strictly limited, or has sharp directivity, different and independent views are presented to different viewpoints. Design parameters including the resolution of viewpoints and update rate for viewers are clarified, and the effect of the refresh rate of display panels, speed of rotation, directivity of the panel on these parameters are discussed. Based on the discussion; the implementation of a prototype is reported. A directional filter using lenticular and slit array is devised, and its characteristic is evaluated. Also, a rendering algorithm that takes into account the effect of rotation of the display panel is proposed. Through experiments the feasibility of the proposed approach is confirmed.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Koichi Hirota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hirota:Koichi", "Kazuyoshi Tagawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tagawa:Kazuyoshi", "Yasuhiro Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Yasuhiro"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
