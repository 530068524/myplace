{"title": "Tracking Dynamic Sources of Malicious Activity at Internet Scale.", "fields": ["data set", "paging", "the internet", "pruning", "decision tree"], "abstract": "We formulate and address the problem of discovering dynamic malicious regions on the Internet. We model this problem as one of adaptively pruning a known decision tree, but with additional challenges: (1) severe space requirements, since the underlying decision tree has over 4 billion leaves, and (2) a changing target function, since malicious activity on the Internet is dynamic. We present a novel algorithm that addresses this problem, by putting together a number of different \"experts\" algorithms and online paging algorithms. We prove guarantees on our algorithm's performance as a function of the best possible pruning of a similar size, and our experiments show that our algorithm achieves high accuracy on large real-world data sets, with significant improvements over existing approaches.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["AT&T Labs", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Berkeley", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shobha Venkataraman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Venkataraman:Shobha", "Avrim Blum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blum:Avrim", "Dawn Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Dawn", "Subhabrata Sen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sen:Subhabrata", "Oliver Spatscheck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spatscheck:Oliver"], "pages": 9}
