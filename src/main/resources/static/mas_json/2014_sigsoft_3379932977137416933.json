The advantages of designs based on this style over designs based on the Observer design pattern have been studied for a long time. Over the years, researchers have enriched reactive languages with more powerful abstractions, embedded these abstractions into mainstream languages \u2013 including object-oriented languages \u2013 and applied reactive programming to several domains, like GUIs, animations, Web applications, robotics, and sensor networks. However, an important assumption behind this line of research \u2013 that, beside other advantages, reactive programming makes a wide class of otherwise cumbersome applications more comprehensible \u2013 has never been evaluated. In this paper, we present the design and the results of the first empirical study that evaluates the effect of reactive programming on comprehensibility compared to the traditional object-oriented style with the Observer design pattern. Results confirm the conjecture that comprehensibility is enhanced by reactive programming. In the experiment, the reactive programming group significantly outperforms the other group.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Lancaster University"], "authors": ["Guido Salvaneschi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Salvaneschi:Guido", "Sven Amann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amann:Sven", "Sebastian Proksch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Proksch:Sebastian", "Mira Mezini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mezini:Mira"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
