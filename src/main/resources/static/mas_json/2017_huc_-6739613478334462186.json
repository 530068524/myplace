In this paper, we demonstrate how to collect data from ubiquitous WiFi networks (WLAN), and further to characterize the mobility of campus residents by exploring time-frequency patterns with spatial context. On the campus of Tsinghua University (where everyday nearly 60, 000 mobile devices appear in the public areas of more than 110 buildings), we obtain large-scale observations on physical activities, and provide insights for better diagnosing of WiFi hotspots.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Mengyu Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Mengyu", "Dan Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Dan", "Kaixin Sui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sui:Kaixin", "Thomas Moscibroda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moscibroda:Thomas"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 5}
