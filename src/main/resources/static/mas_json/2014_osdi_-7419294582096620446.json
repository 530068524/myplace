We present the design and implementation of a new driver synthesis toolkit, called Termite-2. Termite-2 is the first tool to combine the power of automation with the flexibility of conventional development. It is also the first practical synthesis tool based on abstraction refinement. Finally, it is the first synthesis tool to support automated debugging of input specifications. We demonstrate the practicality of Termite-2 by synthesizing drivers for a number of I/O devices representative of a typical embedded platform.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "NICTA", "Intel", "NICTA", "Intel"], "authors": ["Leonid Ryzhyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryzhyk:Leonid", "Adam Walker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walker:Adam", "John Keys.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keys:John", "Alexander Legg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Legg:Alexander", "Arun Raghunath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghunath:Arun", "Michael Stumm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stumm:Michael", "Mona Vij.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vij:Mona"], "conf": "osdi", "year": "2014", "pages": 16}
