In multi-view 3D video, several 3D video sequences should be captured simultaneously from the same scene but through different viewing angles. One of the major challenges in this field is how to transmit the large amount of data of a multi-view 3D video sequence over error prone channels to heterogeneous devices with different bandwidth, resolution, and processing power, while maintaining a high visual quality. Scalable Multi-view 3D Video Coding (SMVC) is one of the methods to address this challenge. But there are many difficulties in SMVC that makes it impractical in most 3D video applications. In this work, we propose an adaptive framework to use SMVC in various 3D video applications effectively. The current prototype shows enhanced capability in handling the existing 3D video applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tehran"], "authors": ["Hoda Roodaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roodaki:Hoda"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
