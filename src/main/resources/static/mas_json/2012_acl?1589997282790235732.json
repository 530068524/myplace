Specifically, we consider unsupervised induction of semantic roles from sentences annotated with automatically-predicted syntactic dependency representations and use a state-of-the-art generative Bayesian non-parametric model. At inference time, instead of only seeking the model which explains the monolingual data available for each language, we regularize the objective by introducing a soft constraint penalizing for disagreement in argument labeling on aligned sentences. We propose a simple approximate learning algorithm for our set-up which results in efficient inference. When applied to German-English parallel data, our method obtains a substantial improvement over a model trained without using the agreement signal, when both are tested on non-parallel sentences.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ivan Titov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Titov:Ivan", "Alexandre Klementiev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klementiev:Alexandre"], "pages": 10}
