Recently a new class of locally decodable codes, based on families of vectors with restricted dot products has been discovered. We refer to those codes as Matching Vector (MV) codes. In this work we develop a new view of MV codes and uncover certain similarities between them and classical Reed Muller codes. Our view allows us to obtain a deeper insight into the power and limitations of MV codes. We use it to construct codes that can tolerate more errors or are shorter than previously known codes for certain parameter settings. We also show super-linear lower bounds on the codeword length of any MV code.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "zeev.dvir@gmail.com"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Zeev Dvir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dvir:Zeev", "Parikshit Gopalan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gopalan:Parikshit", "Sergey Yekhanin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yekhanin:Sergey"], "pages": 10}
