{"title": "Embodied Design Ideation Methods: Analysing the Power of Estrangement.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "design research", "ideation", "design methods", "embodied cognition"], "abstract": "Embodied design ideation  practices work with relationships between body, material and context to enliven design and research potential. Methods are often idiosyncratic and due to their physical nature not easily transferred. This presents challenges for designers wishing to develop and share techniques or contribute to research. We present a framework that enables designers to understand, describe and contextualise their embodied design ideation practices in ways that can be understood by peers, as well as those new to embodied ideation. Our framework developed over two conference workshops provides a frame for discussion of embodied design actions that leverage the power of estrangement. We apply our framework to eight embodied design ideation methods. Our contribution is thus twofold: (1) a framework to understand and leverage the power of estrangement in embodied design ideation, and (2) an inspirational catalogue demonstrating the diversity of ideas that embodied design ideation methods can foster.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Southern Denmark", "IT University of Copenhagen", "Eindhoven University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Danielle Wilde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilde:Danielle", "Anna Vallg\u00e5rda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vallg=aring=rda:Anna", "Oscar Tomico.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tomico:Oscar"], "pages": 13}
