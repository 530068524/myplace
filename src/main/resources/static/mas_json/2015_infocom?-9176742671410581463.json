{"title": "Approximation algorithm for minimum weight fault-tolerant virtual backbone in homogeneous wireless sensor network.", "fields": ["real number", "unit disk graph", "network planning and design", "dominating set", "minimum weight"], "abstract": "In a wireless sensor network, the virtual backbone plays an important role. Due to accidental damage or energy depletion, it is desirable that the virtual backbone is fault-tolerant. Such a consideration leads to the problem of finding a minimum weight k-connected m-fold dominating set ((k, m)-MWCDS for short). In this paper, we give an (\u03b1 + 2.5\u03c1)-approximation for (2, m)-MWCDS with m \u2265 2 in unit disk graph, where \u03b1 is the performance ratio for the minimum weight m-fold dominating set problem, and \u03c1 is the performance ratio for the {0,1,2}-Steiner Network Design problem. In view of currently best known ratios for \u03b1 and \u03c1, (2, m)-MWCDS has a (9 + e)-approximation for m \u2265 3 and a (8 + e)-approximation for m =2, where e is an arbitrary positive real number.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Zhejiang Normal University", "Xinjiang University"], "authors": ["Zhao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0002:Zhao", "Yishuo Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Yishuo"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 6}
