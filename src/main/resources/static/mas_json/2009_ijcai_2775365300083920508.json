Activity recognition \"sees\" what is in the window to predict the locations, trajectories, actions, goals and plans of humans and objects. Building an activity recognition system requires a full range of interaction from statistical inference on lower level sensor data to symbolic AI at higher levels, where prediction results and acquired knowledge are passed up each level to form a knowledge food chain. In this article, I will give an overview of some of the current activity recognition research works and explore a life-cycle of learning and inference that allows the lowest-level radio-frequency signals to be transformed into symbolic logical representations for AI planning, which in turn controls the robots or guides human users through a sensor network, thus completing a full life cycle of knowledge.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "authors": ["Qiang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0001:Qiang"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
