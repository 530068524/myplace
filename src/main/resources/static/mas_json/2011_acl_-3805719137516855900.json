{"title": "Contrasting Opposing Views of News Articles on Contentious Issues.", "fields": ["machine learning", "support vector machine", "adversary", "classifier", "hits algorithm"], "abstract": "We present disputant relation-based method for classifying news articles on contentious issues. We observe that the disputants of a contention are an important feature for understanding the discourse. It performs unsupervised classification on news articles based on disputant relations, and helps readers intuitively view the articles through the opponent-based frame. The readers can attain balanced understanding on the contention, free from a specific biased view. We applied a modified version of HITS algorithm and an SVM classifier trained with pseudo-relevant data for article analysis.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["KAIST", "Chonbuk National University", "KAIST"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Souneil Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Souneil", "Kyung Soon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Kyung_Soon", "Junehwa Song.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Song:Junehwa"], "pages": 10}
