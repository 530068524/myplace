In the restricted but indicative case of two-party protocols in the face of malicious fail-stop faults, we first show how the traditional notions of secrecy and correctness of protocols can be captured as properties of Nash equilibria in games for rational players. Next, we concentrate on fairness. Here we demonstrate a Game Theoretic notion and two different cryptographic notions that turn out to all be equivalent. In addition, we provide a simulation based notion that implies the previous three. All four notions are weaker than existing cryptographic notions of fairness. In particular, we show that they can be met in some natural setting where existing notions of fairness are provably impossible to achieve.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Bar-Ilan University", "Tel Aviv University", "Aarhus University"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["Gilad Asharov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Asharov:Gilad", "Ran Canetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canetti:Ran", "Carmit Hazay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hazay:Carmit"], "pages": 20}
