We present results from a survey of 802 users from an enterprise social networking site that identifies two groups of employees (new to the company and geographically distant from headquarters) that perceive higher benefit from using a SNS to learn about the organization's values and beliefs. In addition, we observe regional differences in viewing behaviors between two groups of new employees. These results suggest that a SNS can also potentially contribute to the information-seeking and sense-making activities that underlie organization acculturation.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Jennifer Thom-Santelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thom=Santelli:Jennifer", "David R.
