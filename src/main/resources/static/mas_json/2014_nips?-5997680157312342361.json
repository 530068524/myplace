Existing inference methods are based on either variational approximation or Monte Carlo sampling. This paper presents a novel spectral decomposition algorithm to recover the parameters of supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) models. The Spectral-sLDA algorithm is provably correct and computationally efficient. We prove a sample complexity bound and subsequently derive a sufficient condition for the identifiability of sLDA. Thorough experiments on a diverse range of synthetic and real-world datasets verify the theory and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Tsinghua University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yining Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Yining", "Jun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu_0001:Jun"], "pages": 9}
