This improves all previous constructions of linear-sized spectral sparsification, which requires a#x03A9;(n2) time. A key ingredient in our algorithm is a novel combination of two techniques used in literature for constructing spectral sparsification: Random sampling by effective resistance, and adaptive constructions based on barrier functions [1], [3].", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "University of Bristol"], "authors": ["Yin Tat Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yin_Tat", "He Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:He"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2015", "pages": 20}
