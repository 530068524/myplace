In this paper, we identify singlehop feedback collection as a key building block for in-network processing applications, and introduce a basic singlehop primitive, pollcast. The key idea behind this primitive is to exploit the receiver-side collision detection information at the MAC-layer to speed-up collaborative feedback collection. Using pollcast, a node can get an affirmation about the existence of a node-level predicate P in its neighborhood in constant time by asking all nodes where P hold to reply simultaneously. We have implemented pollcast on Tmotes using Chipcon 2420 radio. Our results show that this primitive is indeed lightweight, resilient, and effective. Our paper is also the first time receiver-side collision detection is achieved in a practical manner for Chipcon 2420 radio.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo", "University at Buffalo"], "authors": ["Murat Demirbas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Demirbas:Murat", "Onur Soysal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soysal:Onur", "Muzammil Hussain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hussain:Muzammil"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
