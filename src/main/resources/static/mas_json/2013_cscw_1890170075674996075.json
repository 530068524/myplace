While connectivity solves a major issue, concepts such as browsing and searching are not intuitive to such users. This paper presents the design of a multimodal (speech+icons) voice browser for low-literate users in rural India. We conducted a field study to determine their current communication styles and preferences. Based on this, we designed three browsers, each influenced by a specific way of communicating -- persona based roles, storytelling and direct interaction. The prototypes were evaluated in a task-based study with 62 low-literate users and were compared with a baseline Interactive Voice Response (IVR) browser. Our results suggest that there is clear acceptance and understanding of the necessary concepts if the browser is designed using the design constructs of persona based roles and storytelling.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Samsung", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Mahelaqua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahelaqua:", "Sara Basson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basson:Sara", "Nitendra Rajput.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajput:Nitendra", "Kundan Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Kundan", "Saurabh Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Saurabh", "John C.
