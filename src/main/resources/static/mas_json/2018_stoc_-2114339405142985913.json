{"title": "Counting hypergraph colourings in the local lemma regime.", "fields": ["hypergraph", "lovasz local lemma", "constraint graph", "degree", "lemma"], "abstract": "We give a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) to count the number of  q -colorings for  k -uniform hypergraphs with maximum degree \u0394 if  k \u2265 28 and  q  > 315\u0394 14/ k \u221214 . We also obtain a polynomial-time almost uniform sampler if  q >798\u0394 16/ k \u221216/3 . These are the first approximate counting and sampling algorithms in the regime  q \u226a\u0394 (for large \u0394 and  k ) without any additional assumptions. Our method is based on the recent work of Moitra (STOC, 2017). One important contribution of ours is to remove the dependency of  k  and \u0394 in Moitra\u2019s approach.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai University of Finance and Economics", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Heng Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo_0001:Heng", "Chao Liao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liao:Chao", "Pinyan Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Pinyan", "Chihao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chihao"], "pages": 14}
