The aim is to find a set of ABox modifications (deletions and additions), called a repair plan, that addresses as many of the defects as possible. After formalizing this problem and introducing different notions of optimality, we investigate the computational complexity of reasoning about optimal repair plans and propose interactive algorithms for computing such plans. For deletion-only repair plans, we also present a prototype implementation of the core components of the algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Meghyn Bienvenu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bienvenu:Meghyn", "Camille Bourgaux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bourgaux:Camille", "Fran\u00e7ois Goasdou\u00e9.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goasdou=eacute=:Fran=ccedil=ois"], "pages": 8}
