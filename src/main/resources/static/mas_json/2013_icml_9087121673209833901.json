{"title": "Exploiting Ontology Structures and Unlabeled Data for Learning.", "fields": ["machine learning", "semi supervised learning", "ontology", "ontology based data integration"], "abstract": "We present and analyze a theoretical model designed to understand and explain the effectiveness of ontologies for learning multiple related tasks from primarily unlabeled data. We present both information-theoretic results as well as efficient algorithms.\n\nWe show in this model that an ontology, which specifies the relationships between multiple outputs, in some cases is sufficient to completely learn a classification using a large unlabeled data source.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Tel Aviv University"], "authors": ["Nina Balcan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balcan:Nina", "Avrim Blum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blum:Avrim", "Yishay Mansour.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mansour:Yishay"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
