In this paper, we study the problem of detecting communities by combining social relations and user generated content in social networks. We propose a nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (NMTF) based clustering framework with three types of graph regularization. The NMTF based clustering framework can combine the relations and content seamlessly and the graph regularization can capture user similarity, message similarity and user interaction explicitly. In order to design regularization components, we further exploit user similarity and message similarity in social networks. A unified optimization problem is proposed by integrating the NMTF framework and the graph regularization. Then we derive an iterative learning algorithm for this optimization problem. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world data sets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Stony Brook University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Yulong Pei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pei:Yulong", "Nilanjan Chakraborty.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chakraborty:Nilanjan", "Katia P.
