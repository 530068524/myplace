In this paper, we study the problem of first-order indefinability of answer set programs. We provide an Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game-theoretic characterization for the first-order indefinability of answer set programs on finite structures. As an application of this approach, we show that the well-known finding Hamiltonian cycles program is not first-order definable on finite structures. We then define two notions named the 0-1 property and unbounded cycles or paths under the answer set semantics, from which we develop two sufficient conditions that may be effectively used in proving a program's first-order indefin-ability on finite structures under certain circumstances.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["South China Normal University", "University of Western Sydney", "University of Western Sydney"], "authors": ["Yin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yin", "Yan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0003:Yan", "Yi Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yi"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2010", "pages": -1}
