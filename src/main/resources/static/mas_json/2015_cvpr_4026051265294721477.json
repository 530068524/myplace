Our first contribution is 3D pose-indexed features that generalize the previous 2D parameterized features and achieve better invariance to 3D transformations. Our second contribution is a principled hierarchical regression that is adapted to the articulated object structure. It is therefore more accurate and faster. Comprehensive experiments verify the state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach on the challenging 3D hand pose estimation problem, on a public dataset and our new dataset.", "citation": "Citations (143)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Microsoft", "Tongji University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Microsoft"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Xiao Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Xiao", "Yichen Wei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wei:Yichen", "Shuang Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Shuang", "Xiaoou Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Xiaoou", "Jian Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Jian"], "pages": 9}
