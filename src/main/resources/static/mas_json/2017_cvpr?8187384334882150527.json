{"title": "Context-Aware Correlation Filter Tracking.", "fields": ["kernel", "bittorrent tracker", "benchmark", "frame rate", "popularity"], "abstract": "Correlation filter (CF) based trackers have recently gained a lot of popularity due to their impressive performance on benchmark datasets, while maintaining high frame rates. A significant amount of recent research focuses on the incorporation of stronger features for a richer representation of the tracking target. However, this only helps to discriminate the target from background within a small neighborhood. In this paper, we present a framework that allows the explicit incorporation of global context within CF trackers. We reformulate the original optimization problem and provide a closed form solution for single and multi-dimensional features in the primal and dual domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this framework significantly improves the performance of many CF trackers with only a modest impact on frame rate.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Matthias Mueller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mueller:Matthias", "Neil Smith.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Smith:Neil", "Bernard Ghanem.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghanem:Bernard"], "pages": 9}
