Both of them are linear learning problems and lead to a sparse representation of the data. However, the sparsity obtained by these methods does not always satisfy locality conditions, thus the obtained data representation is not the best. This paper introduces a locality-constrained concept factorization method which imposes a locality constraint onto the traditional concept factorization. By requiring the concepts (basis vectors) to be as close to the original data points as possible, each data can be represented by a linear combination of only a few basis concepts. Thus our method is able to achieve sparsity and locality at the same time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel algorithm through a set of evaluations on real world applications.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Haifeng Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Haifeng", "Zheng Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Zheng", "Zhaohui Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Zhaohui"], "pages": 6}
