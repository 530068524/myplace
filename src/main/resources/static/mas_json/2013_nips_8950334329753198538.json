{"title": "Third-Order Edge Statistics: Contour Continuation, Curvature, and Cortical Connections.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "spectral test", "pairwise comparison", "embedding", "continuation"], "abstract": "Association field models have attempted to explain human contour grouping performance, and to explain the mean frequency of long-range horizontal connections across cortical columns in V1. However, association fields only depend on the pairwise statistics of edges in natural scenes. We develop a spectral test of the sufficiency of pairwise statistics and show there is significant higher order structure. An analysis using a probabilistic spectral embedding reveals curvature-dependent components.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Yale University", "Yale University"], "authors": ["Matthew Lawlor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lawlor:Matthew", "Steven W.
