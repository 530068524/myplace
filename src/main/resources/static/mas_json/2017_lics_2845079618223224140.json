For several years the focus of the CSP research has been on \u2018hybrid\u2019 algorithms that somehow combine the two approaches. In this paper we present a new method of such hybridization that allows us to solve certain CSPs that has been out of reach for a quite a while. We consider these method on a fairly restricted class of CSPs given by algebras we will call semilattice block Mal'tsev. An algebra A is called semilattice block Mal'tsev if it has a binary operation f, a ternary operation m, and a congruence \u03c3 such that the quotient A/ \u03c3  with operation f is a semilattice, f is a projection on every block of \u03c3, and every block of \u03c3 is a Mal'tsev algebra with Mal'tsev operation m. We show that the constraint satisfaction problem over a semilattice block Mal'tsev algebra is solvable in polynomial time.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University"], "authors": ["Andrei A.
