With portability as a main goal, we address the challenges in the camera setup, time synchronization, video acquisition, and networking in the design and implementation of the system. Having been deployed in public performances, MobileTI proves to be effective, efficient, and user-friendly. Our experimental findings in terms of technical performance and user feedback are presented.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Wanmin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Wanmin", "Raoul Rivas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rivas:Raoul", "Md.
