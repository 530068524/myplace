We investigate this incorporation in the context of answer sentence selection, and show that combining a set of query matching, readability, and query focus features into a simple convolutional neural network can lead to markedly increased effectiveness. Our results on two standard question-answering datasets show the effectiveness of the combined model.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["RMIT University", "RMIT University", "RMIT University", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Ruey-Cheng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Ruey=Cheng", "Evi Yulianti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yulianti:Evi", "Mark Sanderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanderson:Mark", "W.
