To do so we introduce three new ideas in the derivative-free optimization   literature: (i) kernel methods, (ii) a generalization of Bernoulli convolutions, and (iii) a new annealing schedule for exponential weights (with increasing learning rate). The basic version of our algorithm achieves \ufffd ( n  9.5  \u00e2   T )-regret, and we show that a simple variant of this algorithm can be run in  poly ( n  log( T ))-time per step at the cost of an additional  poly ( n )  T   o (1)  factor in the regret. These results improve upon the \ufffd ( n  11  \u00e2   T )-regret and exp( poly ( T ))-time result of the first two authors, and the log( T )  poly ( n )  \u00e2   T -regret and log( T )  poly ( n ) -time result of Hazan and Li. Furthermore we conjecture that another variant of the algorithm could achieve \ufffd ( n  1.5  \u00e2   T )-regret, and moreover that this regret is unimprovable (the current best lower bound being I\u00a9( n  \u00e2   T ) and it is achieved with linear functions). For the simpler situation of zeroth order stochastic convex optimization this corresponds to the conjecture that the optimal query complexity is of order  n  3  / N  2 .", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["S\u00e9bastien Bubeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bubeck:S=eacute=bastien", "Yin Tat Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Yin_Tat", "Ronen Eldan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eldan:Ronen"], "pages": 14}
