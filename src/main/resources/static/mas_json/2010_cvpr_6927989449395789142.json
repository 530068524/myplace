{"title": "Food recognition using statistics of pairwise local features.", "fields": ["discriminative model", "fold", "histogram", "pairwise comparison", "ingredient"], "abstract": "Food recognition is difficult because food items are de-formable objects that exhibit significant variations in appearance. We believe the key to recognizing food is to exploit the spatial relationships between different ingredients (such as meat and bread in a sandwich). We propose a new representation for food items that calculates pairwise statistics between local features computed over a soft pixellevel segmentation of the image into eight ingredient types. We accumulate these statistics in a multi-dimensional histogram, which is then used as a feature vector for a discriminative classifier. Our experiments show that the proposed representation is significantly more accurate at identifying food than existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (197)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Intel", "Intel", "Intel"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Shulin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Shulin", "Mei Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Mei", "Dean Pomerleau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pomerleau:Dean", "Rahul Sukthankar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sukthankar:Rahul"], "pages": 8}
