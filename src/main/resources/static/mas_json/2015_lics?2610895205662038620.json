We study this setting using domain theory, and show that a given operator algebra is scattered if and only if its associated partial order is, equivalently: continuous (a domain), algebraic, atomistic, quasi-continuous, or quasialgebraic. In that case, conversely, we prove that the Lawson topology, modelling information approximation, allows one to associate an operator algebra to the domain.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Radboud University Nijmegen"], "authors": ["Chris Heunen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heunen:Chris", "Bert Lindenhovius.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lindenhovius:Bert"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
