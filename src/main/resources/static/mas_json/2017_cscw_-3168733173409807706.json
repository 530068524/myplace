Research looking at everyday design practices and the democratization of innovation indicates that deeper understanding of non-expert design practices has a positive impact on technology development. This qualitative study focuses on the creation, use and dissemination of vernacular visualizations in a citizen science project. Findings from this research (1) map visualization practices in an established citizen science project, (2) contribute to theoretical understanding of the ways in which vernacular visualization practices support data-rich collaborative and coordinated work, and (3) suggest ways in which visualizations and visual resources can be evaluated in terms of their abilities to enrich coordination and communication in these contexts.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Washington"], "authors": ["Jaime Snyder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Snyder:Jaime"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2017", "pages": 15}
