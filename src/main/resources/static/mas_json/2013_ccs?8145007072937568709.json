We demonstrate that even with perfect emulation of the cover channel, these systems can be vulnerable to attacks that detect or disrupt the covert communications while having no effect on legitimate cover traffic. Our attacks stem from differences in the channel requirements for the cover protocols, which are peer-to-peer and loss tolerant, and the covert traffic, which is client-proxy and loss intolerant. These differences represent significant limitations and suggest that such protocols are a poor choice of cover channel for general censorship circumvention schemes.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota", "University of Minnesota"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["John Geddes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geddes:John", "Max Schuchard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuchard:Max", "Nicholas Hopper.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hopper:Nicholas"], "pages": 12}
