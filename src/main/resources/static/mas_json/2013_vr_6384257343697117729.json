Recent advances in webcam-based tracking technologies made it easy to bring natural human motions and gestures into play. However, video tracking is a CPU-intensive process, which may have a negative impact on game performance. We measured this impact for different types of 3D content and found it to be minimal, on multi-core platforms. We provide details on implementation and evaluation of our system. Also, we suggest several examples how natural motion can be used in 3D games.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Samsung", "Sunflower Research Labs"], "authors": ["Andrei Sherstyuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sherstyuk:Andrei", "Anton Treskunov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Treskunov:Anton"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2013", "pages": 2}
