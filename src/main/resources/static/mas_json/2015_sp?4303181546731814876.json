{"title": "Last-Level Cache Side-Channel Attacks are Practical.", "fields": ["ciphertext only attack", "watermarking attack", "timing attack", "covert channel", "pre play attack"], "abstract": "We present an effective implementation of the Prime Probe side-channel attack against the last-level cache. We measure the capacity of the covert channel the attack creates and demonstrate a cross-core, cross-VM attack on multiple versions of GnuPG. Our technique achieves a high attack resolution without relying on weaknesses in the OS or virtual machine monitor or on sharing memory between attacker and victim.", "citation": "Citations (294)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Princeton University", "University of Adelaide", "NICTA", "NICTA"], "authors": ["Fangfei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Fangfei", "Yuval Yarom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yarom:Yuval", "Qian Ge.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ge:Qian", "Gernot Heiser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heiser:Gernot", "Ruby B.
