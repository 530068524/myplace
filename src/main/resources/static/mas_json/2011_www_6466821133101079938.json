{"title": "A better uncle for OWL: nominal schemas for integrating rules and ontologies.", "fields": ["owl s", "web ontology language", "semantic web rule language", "ontology language", "datalog"], "abstract": "We propose a description-logic style extension of OWL 2 with  nominal schemas  which can be used like \"variable nominal classes\" within axioms. This feature allows ontology languages to express arbitrary  DL-safe rules  (as expressible in SWRL or RIF) in their native syntax. We show that adding nominal schemas to OWL 2 does not increase the worst-case reasoning complexity, and we identify a novel tractable language  SROELV  3 (\u2229, x) that is versatile enough to capture the lightweight languages OWL EL and OWL RL.", "citation": "Citations (95)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "Wright State University", "Wright State University", "Wright State University"], "authors": ["Markus Kr\u00f6tzsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kr=ouml=tzsch:Markus", "Frederick Maier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maier:Frederick", "Adila Krisnadhi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krisnadhi:Adila", "Pascal Hitzler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hitzler:Pascal"], "conf": "www", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
