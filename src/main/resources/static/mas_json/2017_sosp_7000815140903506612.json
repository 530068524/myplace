We base the design of Hyperkernel's interface on xv6, a Unix-like teaching operating system. Hyperkernel introduces three key ideas to achieve proof automation: it finitizes the kernel interface to avoid unbounded loops or recursion; it separates kernel and user address spaces to simplify reasoning about virtual memory; and it performs verification at the LLVM intermediate representation level to avoid modeling complicated C semantics.   We have verified the implementation of Hyperkernel with the Z3 SMT solver, checking a total of 50 system calls and other trap handlers. Experience shows that Hyperkernel can avoid bugs similar to those found in xv6, and that the verification of Hyperkernel can be achieved with a low proof burden.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Luke Nelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nelson:Luke", "Helgi Sigurbjarnarson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sigurbjarnarson:Helgi", "Kaiyuan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Kaiyuan", "Dylan Johnson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnson:Dylan", "James Bornholt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bornholt:James", "Emina Torlak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torlak:Emina", "Xi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xi"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2017", "pages": 18}
