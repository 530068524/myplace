We frame AM both as a token-based dependency parsing and as a token-based sequence tagging problem, including a multi-task learning setup. Contrary to models that operate on the argument component level, we find that framing AM as dependency parsing leads to subpar performance results. In contrast, less complex (local) tagging models based on BiLSTMs perform robustly across classification scenarios, being able to catch long-range dependencies inherent to the AM problem. Moreover, we find that jointly learning \u2018natural\u2019 subtasks, in a multi-task learning setup, improves performance.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Goethe University Frankfurt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Steffen Eger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eger:Steffen", "Johannes Daxenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daxenberger:Johannes", "Iryna Gurevych.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurevych:Iryna"], "pages": 12}
