{"title": "The Sharing Tracker: Using Ideas from Cache Coherence Hardware to Reduce Off-Chip Memory Traffic with Non-Coherent Caches.", "fields": ["cache algorithms", "multithreading", "bus sniffing", "cache coherence", "locality of reference"], "abstract": "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have recently emerged as a new platform for high performance, general-purpose computing. Because current GPUs employ deep multithreading to hide latency, they only have small, per-core caches to capture reuse and eliminate unnecessary off-chip accesses. This paper shows that for general-purpose workloads, the ability to copy cache lines between private caches captures inter-core temporal locality and provides substantial reductions in off-chip bandwidth requirements. Unlike hardware cache coherence, a sharing tracker only needs to track cache lines in the private caches imprecisely, because it is only a performance hint. This simplifies the implementation and is so effective at capturing inter-core reuse that the L2 can be eliminated entirely. The sharing tracker is motivated by but not specific to the GPU and could be used in other manycore organizations.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Virginia", "University of Virginia"], "authors": ["David Tarjan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarjan:David", "Kevin Skadron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skadron:Kevin"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
