{"title": "Interactive Top-k Spatial Keyword queries.", "fields": ["data mining", "spatial query", "information retrieval", "database", "empirical research"], "abstract": "Conventional top-k spatial keyword queries require users to explicitly specify their preferences between spatial proximity and keyword relevance. In this work we investigate how to eliminate this requirement by enhancing the conventional queries with interaction, resulting in Interactive Top-k Spatial Keyword (ITkSK) query. Having confirmed the feasibility by theoretical analysis, we propose a three-phase solution focusing on both effectiveness and efficiency. The first phase substantially narrows down the search space for subsequent phases by efficiently retrieving a set of geo-textual k-skyband objects as the initial candidates. In the second phase three practical strategies for selecting a subset of candidates are developed with the aim of maximizing the expected benefit for learning user preferences at each round of interaction. Finally we discuss how to determine the termination condition automatically and estimate the preference based on the user's feedback. Empirical study based on real PoI datasets verifies our theoretical observation that the quality of top-k results in spatial keyword queries can be greatly improved through only a few rounds of interactions.", "citation": "Citations (42)", "departments": ["University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "University of Queensland", "China University of Petroleum", "Soochow University"], "authors": ["Kai Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng_0001:Kai", "Han Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Han", "Bolong Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Bolong", "Shuo Shang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shang:Shuo", "Jiajie Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jiajie", "Jiajun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jiajun", "Xiaofang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Xiaofang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
