{"title": "EDF-VD Scheduling of Mixed-Criticality Systems with Degraded Quality Guarantees.", "fields": ["scheduling", "fair share scheduling", "mixed criticality", "criticality", "speedup"], "abstract": "This paper studies real-time scheduling of mixed-criticality systems where low-criticality tasks are still guaranteed some service in the high-criticality mode, with reduced execution budgets. First, we present a utilization-based schedulability test for such systems under EDF-VD scheduling. Second, we quantify the suboptimality of EDF-VD (with our test condition) in terms of speedup factors. In general, the speedup factor is a function with respect to the ratio between the amount of resource required by different types of tasks in different criticality modes, and reaches 4/3 in the worst case. Furthermore, we show that the proposed utilization-based schedulability test and speedup factor results apply to the elastic mixed-criticality model as well. Experiments show effectiveness of our proposed method and confirm the theoretical suboptimality results.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Leiden University", "Leiden University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "rtss", "authors": ["Di Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Di", "Jelena Spasic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Spasic:Jelena", "Nan Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Nan", "Gang Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0023:Gang", "Songran Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Songran", "Todor Stefanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stefanov:Todor", "Wang Yi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yi_0001:Wang"], "pages": 12}
