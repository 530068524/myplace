{"title": "A type and effect system for deterministic parallel Java.", "fields": ["deterministic system", "deterministic parallel java", "effect system", "nondeterministic algorithm", "parallel programming model"], "abstract": "Today's shared-memory parallel programming models are complex and error-prone.While many parallel programs are intended to be deterministic, unanticipated thread interleavings can lead to subtle bugs and nondeterministic semantics. In this paper, we demonstrate that a practical  type and effect system  can simplify parallel programming by  guaranteeing deterministic semantics  with modular, compile-time type checking even in a rich, concurrent object-oriented language such as Java. We describe an object-oriented type and effect system that provides several new capabilities over previous systems for expressing deterministic parallel algorithms.We also describe a language called Deterministic Parallel Java (DPJ) that incorporates the new type system features, and we show that a core subset of DPJ is sound. We describe an experimental validation showing thatDPJ can express a wide range of realistic parallel programs; that the new type system features are useful for such programs; and that the parallel programs exhibit good performance gains (coming close to or beating equivalent, nondeterministic multithreaded programs where those are available).", "citation": "Citations (403)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "oopsla", "authors": ["Robert L.
