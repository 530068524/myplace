{"title": "Practical prediction and prefetch for faster access to applications on mobile phones.", "fields": ["instruction prefetch", "android", "mobile search", "dynamic web page", "mobile deep linking"], "abstract": "Mobile phones have evolved from communication devices to indispensable accessories with access to real-time content. The increasing reliance on dynamic content comes at the cost of increased latency to pull the content from the Internet before the user can start using it. While prior work has explored parts of this problem, they ignore the bandwidth costs of prefetching, incur significant training overhead, need several sensors to be turned on, and do not consider practical systems issues that arise from the limited background processing capability supported by mobile operating systems. In this paper, we make app prefetch practical on mobile phones. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we design an app prediction algorithm, APPM, that requires no prior training, adapts to usage dynamics, predicts not only which app will be used next but also when it will be used, and provides high accuracy without requiring additional sensor context. Second, we perform parallel prefetch on screen unlock, a mechanism that leverages the benefits of prediction while operating within the constraints of mobile operating systems. Our experiments are conducted on long-term traces, live deployments on the Android Play Market, and user studies, and show that we outperform prior approaches to predicting app usage, while also providing practical ways to prefetch application content on mobile phones.", "citation": "Citations (117)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "Microsoft", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "DFKI GmbH, Saar ... r\u00fccken, Germany"], "authors": ["Abhinav Parate.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parate:Abhinav", "Matthias B\u00f6hmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hmer_0001:Matthias", "David Chu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chu:David", "Deepak Ganesan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ganesan:Deepak", "Benjamin M.
