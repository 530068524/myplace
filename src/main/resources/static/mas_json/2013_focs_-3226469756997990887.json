We obtain an almost tight upper bound of  O ( n  2+e ), for any e > 0, on the maximum number of discrete changes that the Delaunay triangulation DT( P ) of  P  experiences during this motion. Our analysis is cast in a purely topological setting, where we only assume that (i) any four points can be co-circular at most three times, and (ii) no triple of points can be collinear more than twice; these assumptions hold for unit speed motions.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Natan Rubin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rubin:Natan"], "pages": 10}
