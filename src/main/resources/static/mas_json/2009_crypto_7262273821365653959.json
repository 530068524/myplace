{"title": "Meet-in-the-Middle Preimage Attacks Against Reduced SHA-0 and SHA-1.", "fields": ["secure hash standard", "hash based message authentication code", "collision attack", "preimage attack", "sha 2"], "abstract": "Preimage resistance of several hash functions has already been broken by the meet-in-the-middle attacks and they utilize a property that their message schedules consist of only permutations of message words. It is unclear whether this type of attacks is applicable to a hash function whose message schedule does not consist of permutations of message words. This paper proposes new attacks against reduced SHA-0 and SHA-1 hash functions by analyzing a message schedule that does not consist of permutations but linear combinations of message words. The newly developed cryptanalytic techniques enable the meet-in-the-middle attack to be applied to reduced SHA-0 and SHA-1 hash functions. The attacks find preimages of SHA-0 and SHA-1 in 2156.6 and 2159.3 compression function computations up to 52 and 48 steps, respectively, compared to the brute-force attack, which requires 2160 compression function computations. The previous best attacks find preimages up to 49 and 44 steps, respectively.", "citation": "Citations (107)", "departments": ["NTT, Tokyo, Japan 180-8585", "NTT, Tokyo, Japan 180-8585"], "authors": ["Kazumaro Aoki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aoki:Kazumaro", "Yu Sasaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sasaki:Yu"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2009", "pages": 20}
