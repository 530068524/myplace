Much knowl- edge can be derived from such information networks if we systematically develop an effective and scalable database-oriented information network analysis technology. In this system demo, we take a computer science research publica- tion network as an example, which is an information net- work derived from an integration of DBLP, other web-based information about researchers, and partially available cita- tion data, and construct a Research-Insight system in order to demonstrate the power of database-oriented information network analysis. We show that nontrivial research insight can be obtained from such analysis, including (1) ranking, clustering, classification and similarity search of researchers, terms and venues for research subfields and themes, (2) recommending good researchers and good research papers to read or cite when conducting research on certain topics (3) predicting potential collaborators for certain theme-oriented research, and (4) predicting advisor-advisee rela- tionships and affiliation history based on historical research publications. Although some of these functions have been studied in recent research, effective and scalable realization of such functions in large networks still poses challenging research problems. Moreover, some function are our on- going research tasks. By integrating these functionalities, Research-Insight may not only provide with us insightful rec- ommendations in CS research but also help us gain insight on how to perform effective data mining in large databases.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Fangbo Tao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tao:Fangbo", "Xiao Yu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yu:Xiao", "Kin Hou Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Kin_Hou", "George Brova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brova:George", "Xiao Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Xiao", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei", "Rucha Kanade.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kanade:Rucha", "Yizhou Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Yizhou", "Chi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Chi", "Lidan Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lidan", "Tim Weninger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weninger:Tim"], "pages": 4}
