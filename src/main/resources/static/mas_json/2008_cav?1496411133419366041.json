In practice, it is often infeasible to model check over the product state space of a concurrent program. The method developed in this paper replaces such global reasoning with checks of (abstracted) individual processes. An automatic refinement step gradually exposes local state if necessary, ensuring that the method is complete. Experiments show that local reasoning can hold a significant advantage over global reasoning.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["New York University", "Bell Labs"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Ariel Cohen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohen_0002:Ariel", "Kedar S.
