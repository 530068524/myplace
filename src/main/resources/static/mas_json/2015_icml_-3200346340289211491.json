{"title": "Towards a Learning Theory of Cause-Effect Inference.", "fields": ["binary classification", "embedding", "causal inference", "fiducial inference", "binary number"], "abstract": "We pose causal inference as the problem of learning to classify probability distributions. In particular, we assume access to a collection {(Si, li)}in=1, where each Si is a sample drawn from the probability distribution of Xi\u00d7Yi, and li is a binary label indicating whether \"Xi\u2192Yi\" or \"Xi\u2190Yi\". Given these data, we build a causal inference rule in two steps. First, we featurize each Si using the kernel mean embedding associated with some characteristic kernel. Second, we train a binary classifier on such embeddings to distinguish between causal directions. We present generalization bounds showing the statistical consistency and learning rates of the proposed approach, and provide a simple implementation that achieves state-of-the-art cause-effect inference. Furthermore, we extend our ideas to infer causal relationships between more than two variables.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["David Lopez-Paz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lopez=Paz:David", "Krikamol Muandet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muandet:Krikamol", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sch=ouml=lkopf:Bernhard", "Ilya O.
