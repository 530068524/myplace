{"title": "Probabilistic Line Searches for Stochastic Optimization.", "fields": ["markov chain", "inference", "stationary distribution", "pairwise comparison", "axiom"], "abstract": "We show that the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate of models derived from Luce's choice axiom (e.g., the Plackett-Luce model) can be expressed as the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. This conveys insight into several recently proposed spectral inference algorithms. We take advantage of this perspective and formulate a new spectral algorithm that is significantly more accurate than previous ones for the Plackett-Luce model. With a simple adaptation, this algorithm can be used iteratively, producing a sequence of estimates that converges to the ML estimate. The ML version runs faster than competing approaches on a benchmark of five datasets. Our algorithms are easy to implement, making them relevant for practitioners at large.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Maren Mahsereci.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahsereci:Maren", "Philipp Hennig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hennig:Philipp"], "pages": 9}
