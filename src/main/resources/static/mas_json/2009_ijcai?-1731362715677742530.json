{"title": "Improving Morphology Induction by Learning Spelling Rules.", "fields": ["morphology", "spelling rule", "spelling", "unsupervised learning", "bayesian inference"], "abstract": "Unsupervised learning of morphology is an important task for human learners and in natural language processing systems. Previous systems focus on segmenting words into substrings (taking \u21d2 tak.ing), but sometimes a segmentation-only analysis is insufficient (e.g., taking may be more appropriately analyzed as take+ing, with a spelling rule accounting for the deletion of the stem-final e). In this paper, we develop a Bayesian model for simultaneously inducing both morphology and spelling rules. We show that the addition of spelling rules improves performance over the baseline morphology-only model.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Jason Naradowsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Naradowsky:Jason", "Sharon Goldwater.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldwater:Sharon"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2009", "pages": 6}
