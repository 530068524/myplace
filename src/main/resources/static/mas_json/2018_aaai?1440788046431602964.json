{"title": "Computational Social Choice and Computational Complexity: BFFs?", "fields": ["machine learning", "theoretical computer science", "computational resource", "computational complexity theory", "computational social choice"], "abstract": "We discuss the connection between computational social choice (comsoc) and computational complexity. We stress the work so far on, and urge continued focus on, two less-recognized aspects of this connection. Firstly, this is very much a two-way street: Everyone knows complexity classification is used in comsoc, but we also highlight benefits to complexity that have arisen from its use in comsoc. Secondly, more subtle, less-known complexity tools often can be very productively used in comsoc.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["University of Rochester"], "authors": ["Lane A.
