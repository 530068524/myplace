{"title": "NotiRing: A Comparative Study of Notification Channels for Wearable Interactive Rings.", "fields": ["wearable computer", "embedded system", "computer science", "channel"], "abstract": "We conducted an empirical investigation of wearable interactive rings on the noticeability of four instantaneous notification channels (light, vibration, sound, poke) and a channel with gradually increased temperature (thermal) during five levels of physical activity (laying down, sitting, standing, walking, and running). Results showed that vibration was the most reliable and fastest channel to convey notification, followed by poke and sound which shared similar noticeability. The noticeability of these three channels was not affected by the level of physical activity. The other two channels, light and thermal, were less noticeable and were affected by the level of physical activity. Our post-experimental survey indicates that while noticeability has a significant influence on user preference, each channel has its own unique advantages that make it suitable for different notification scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Thijs Roumen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roumen:Thijs", "Simon T.
