Specifically, we investigate a dense network with n sensor nodes and m = n b  (0 < b < 1) helping nodes, and evaluate the impact of topology on its throughput capacity. For networks without obstacles, we find that uniformly distributed sensor nodes and regularly distributed helping nodes have some advantages in improving the throughput capacity. We also explore properties of networks composed of some isomorphic sub-networks. For networks with obstacles, we assume there are M = \u0398(n v ) (0 < v \u2264 1) arbitrarily or randomly distributed obstacles, which block cells they are located in, i.e., sensor nodes cannot be placed in these cells and nodes' communication cannot cross them directly. We find that the overall throughput capacity is bounded by the transmission burden in areas around these blocked cells and introduce a novel algorithm of complexity O(M) to generate optimal sensor nodes' topologies for any given obstacles' distributions.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "authors": ["Sen Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Sen", "Xinbing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xinbing", "Luoyi Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Luoyi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 9}
