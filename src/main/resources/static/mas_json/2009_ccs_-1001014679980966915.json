In this paper, we characterize the impact of the large scale compromise and coordination of mobile phones in attacks against the core of these networks. Through a combination of measurement, simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the ability of a botnet composed of as few as 11,750 compromised mobile phones to degrade service to area-code sized regions by 93%. As such attacks are accomplished through the execution of network service requests and not a constant stream of phone calls, users are unlikely to be aware of their occurrence. We then investigate a number of significant network bottlenecks, their impact on the density of compromised nodes per base station and how they can be avoided. We conclude by discussing a number of countermeasures that may help to partially mitigate the threats posed by such attacks.", "citation": "Citations (273)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University", "Pennsylvania State University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Patrick Traynor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Traynor:Patrick", "Michael Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Michael", "Machigar Ongtang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ongtang:Machigar", "Vikhyath Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Vikhyath", "Trent Jaeger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaeger:Trent", "Patrick D.
