Our method is based on the framework of boosting. First, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. Then, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of these weak translation systems. To adapt boosting to SMT system combination, several key components of the original boosting algorithms are redesigned in this work. We evaluate our method on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in three baseline systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrase-based system and a syntax-based system. The experimental results on three NIST evaluation test sets show that our method leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baseline systems.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Tong Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Tong", "Jingbo Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Jingbo", "Muhua Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Muhua", "Huizhen Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huizhen"], "pages": 10}
