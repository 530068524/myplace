{"title": "Scalable distributed-memory external sorting.", "fields": ["computer cluster", "massively parallel", "sorting", "external sorting", "distributed memory"], "abstract": "We engineer algorithms for sorting huge data sets on massively parallel machines. The algorithms are based on the multiway merging paradigm. We first outline an algorithm whose I/O requirement is close to a lower bound. Thus, in contrast to naive implementations of multiway merging and all other approaches known to us, the algorithm works with just two passes over the data even for the largest conceivable inputs. A second algorithm reduces communication overhead and uses more conventional specifications of the result at the cost of slightly increased I/O requirements. An implementation wins the well known sorting benchmark in several categories and by a large margin over its competitors.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Mirko Rahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rahn:Mirko", "Peter Sanders.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sanders_0001:Peter", "Johannes Singler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singler:Johannes"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
