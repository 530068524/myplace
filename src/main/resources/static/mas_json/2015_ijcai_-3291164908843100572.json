{"title": "Aggregate Demand-Based Real-Time Pricing Mechanism for the Smart Grid: A Game-Theoretic Analysis.", "fields": ["aggregate demand", "demand curve", "derived demand", "market demand schedule", "demand management"], "abstract": "Managing peak energy demand is a critical problem for energy utilities. The energy costs for the peak periods form a major component of their overall costs. Real-time pricing mechanisms have been explored as a means of flattening the demand curve and reducing the energy costs. In this paper, we examine a model of ex-post real-time pricing mechanism that can be used by the utilities for this purpose. In particular, we study a convex piece-wise linear cost function that modulates the price of energy based on the aggregate demand of the utility. We provide a game-theoretic analysis of the mechanism by constructing a non-cooperative game among the consumers of a utility wherein the cost to each consumer is decided by the pricing mechanism. We formally characterize the Nash equilibrium and other properties for two settings: (i) consumers have full flexibility in shifting their demand, and (ii) consumers can shift only a fraction of their demand at any time to another time.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Universiti Brunei Darussalam", "IBM"], "authors": ["Sambaran Bandyopadhyay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bandyopadhyay:Sambaran", "Ramasuri Narayanam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanam:Ramasuri", "Ramachandra Kota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kota:Ramachandra", "Pg Mohammad Iskandarbin Pg Hj Petra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Petra:Pg_Mohammad_Iskandarbin_Pg_Hj", "Zainul Charbiwala.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charbiwala:Zainul"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
