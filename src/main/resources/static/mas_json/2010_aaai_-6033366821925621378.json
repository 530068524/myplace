To facilitate study into this difficulty and aid in WSD in general, a database of the selectional preferences of non-pertainym prenomial adjectives extracted from the Google Web 1T 5-gram Corpus is proposed. A variety of methods for computing the preferences of each adjective over a set of noun categories from WordNet have been evaluated via simulated disambiguation of pseudo-homonyms. The best method of these involves computing for each noun category the ratio of single-word common (i.e. not proper) noun lemma types which can co-occur with a given adjective to the number of single-word common noun lemmata whose estimated frequency is greater than a threshold based on the frequency of the adjective. The database produced by this procedure will be made available to the public.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Central Florida", "University of Central Florida"], "authors": ["John J.
