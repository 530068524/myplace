Recurrent rules have the form \u201cwhenever a series of precedent events occurs, eventually a series of consequent events occurs\u201d. They are intuitive and characterize behaviors in many domains. An example is the domain of software specification, in which the rules capture a family of properties beneficial to program verification and bug detection. We enhance a past work on mining recurrent rules by Lo, Khoo, and Liu to perform mining more scalably. We propose a new set of pruning properties embedded in a new mining algorithm. Performance and case studies on benchmark synthetic and real datasets show that our approach is much more efficient and outperforms the state-of-the-art approach in mining recurrent rules by up to two orders of magnitude.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Singapore Management University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Singapore Management University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["David Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo_0001:David", "Bolin Ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Ding:Bolin", "Lucia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucia:", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
