{"title": "Online F-Measure Optimization.", "fields": ["performance metric", "precision and recall", "maximization", "online algorithm", "binary number"], "abstract": "The F-measure is an important and commonly used performance metric for binary prediction tasks. By combining precision and recall into a single score, it avoids disadvantages of simple metrics like the error rate, especially in cases of imbalanced class distributions. The problem of optimizing the F-measure, that is, of developing learning algorithms that perform optimally in the sense of this measure, has recently been tackled by several authors. In this paper, we study the problem of F-measure maximization in the setting of online learning. We propose an efficient online algorithm and provide a formal analysis of its convergence properties. Moreover, first experimental results are presented, showing that our method performs well in practice.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Paderborn", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of Paderborn", "Institute of Co ... nology, Poland"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["R\u00f3bert Busa-Fekete.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Busa=Fekete:R=oacute=bert", "Bal\u00e1zs Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sz=ouml=r=eacute=nyi:Bal=aacute=zs", "Krzysztof Dembczynski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dembczynski:Krzysztof", "Eyke H\u00fcllermeier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=uuml=llermeier:Eyke"], "pages": 9}
