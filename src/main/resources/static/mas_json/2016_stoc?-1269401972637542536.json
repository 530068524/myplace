We also present a total function with a power 4 separation between quantum query complexity and approximate polynomial degree, showing severe limitations on the power of the polynomial method. Finally, we exhibit a total function with a quadratic gap between quantum query complexity and certificate complexity, which is optimal (up to log factors). These separations are shown using a new, general technique that we call the cheat sheet technique, which builds upon the techniques of Ambainis et al. [STOC 2016]. The technique is based on a generic transformation that converts any (possibly partial) function into a new total function with desirable properties for showing separations. The framework also allows many known separations, including some recent breakthrough results of Ambainis et al. [STOC 2016], to be shown in a unified manner.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Scott Aaronson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aaronson:Scott", "Shalev Ben-David.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Ben=David:Shalev", "Robin Kothari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kothari:Robin"], "pages": 14}
