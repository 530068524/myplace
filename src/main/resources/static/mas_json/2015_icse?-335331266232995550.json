{"title": "Detecting Inconsistencies in JavaScript MVC Applications.", "fields": ["fault injection", "identifier", "regression testing", "javascript", "software bug"], "abstract": "Higher demands for more reliable and maintainable JavaScript-based web applications have led to the recent development of MVC (Model-View-Controller) frameworks. One of the main advantages of using these frameworks is that they abstract out DOM API method calls, which are one of the leading causes of web application faults, due to their often complicated interaction patterns. However, MVC frameworks are susceptible to inconsistencies between the identifiers and types of variables and functions used throughout the application. In response to this problem, we introduce a formal consistency model for web applications made using MVC frameworks. We propose an approach -- called A urebesh  -- that automatically detects inconsistencies in such applications. We evaluate A urebesh  by conducting a fault injection experiment and by running it on real applications. Our results show that A urebesh  is accurate, with an overall recall of 96.1% and a precision of 100%. It is also useful in detecting bugs, allowing us to find 15 real-world bugs in applications built on AngularJS, a popular MVC framework.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia", "University of British Columbia"], "authors": ["Frolin S.
