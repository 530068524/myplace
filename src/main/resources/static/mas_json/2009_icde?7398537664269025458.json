{"title": "ACStream: Enforcing Access Control over Data Streams.", "fields": ["operator", "data stream", "computer access control", "role based access control", "data stream mining"], "abstract": "In this demo proposal, we illustrate ACStream, a system built on top of Stream Base [1], to specify and enforce access control policies over data streams. ACStream supports a very flexible role-based access control model specifically designed to protect against unauthorized access to streaming data. The core component of ACStream is a query rewriting mechanism that, by exploiting a set of secure operators proposed by us in [2], rewrites a user query in such a way that it does not violate the specified access control policies during its execution. The demo will show how policies modelling a variety of access control requirements can be easily specified and enforced using ACStream.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "University of Insubria", "University of Insubria", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Jianneng Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Jianneng", "Barbara Carminati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carminati:Barbara", "Elena Ferrari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferrari:Elena", "Kian-Lee Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Kian=Lee"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2009", "pages": 4}
