{"title": "Verifying Intervention Policies to Counter Infection Propagation over Networks: A Model Checking Approach.", "fields": ["graph", "model checking", "computer science", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Spread of infections (diseases, ideas, etc.) in a network can be modeled as the evolution of states of nodes in a graph as a function of the states of their neighbors. Given an initial configuration of a network in which a subset of the nodes have been infected, and an infection propagation function that specifies how the states of the nodes evolve over time, we show how to use model checking to identify, verify, and evaluate the effectiveness of intervention policies for containing the propagation of infection over such networks.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "authors": ["Ganesh Ram Santhanam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Santhanam:Ganesh_Ram", "Yuly Suvorov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suvorov:Yuly", "Samik Basu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Basu:Samik", "Vasant G.
