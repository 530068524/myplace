{"title": "Decomposing Activities of Daily Living to Discover Routine Clusters.", "fields": ["wilcoxon signed rank test", "matrix decomposition", "silhouette", "activities of daily living", "time series"], "abstract": "The modern sensor technology helps us collect time series data for activities of daily living (ADLs), which in turn can be used to infer broad patterns, such as common daily routines. Most of the existing approaches either rely on a model trained by a preselected and manually labeled set of activities, or perform micro-pattern analysis with manually selected length and number of micro-patterns. Since real life ADL datasets are massive, such approaches would be too costly to apply. Thus, there is a need to formulate unsupervised methods that can be applied to different time scales. We propose a novel approach to discover clusters of daily activity routines. We use a matrix decomposition method to isolate routines and deviations to obtain two different sets of clusters.We obtain the final memberships via the cross product of these sets. We validate our approach using two real-life ADL datasets and a well-known artificial dataset. Based on average silhouette width scores, our approach can capture strong structures in the underlying data. Furthermore, results show that our approach improves on the accuracy of the baseline algorithms by 12% with a statistical significance (p <0.05) using the Wilcoxon signed-rank comparison test.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Onur Y\u00fcr\u00fcten.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Y=uuml=r=uuml=ten:Onur", "Jiyong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Jiyong", "Pearl Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Pearl"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2014", "pages": 7}
