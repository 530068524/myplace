{"title": "Word Representations: A Simple and General Method for Semi-Supervised Learning.", "fields": ["download", "word embedding", "semi supervised learning", "natural language processing", "chunking"], "abstract": "If we take an existing supervised NLP system, a simple and general way to improve accuracy is to use unsupervised word representations as extra word features. We evaluate Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and HLBL (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words on both NER and chunking. We use near state-of-the-art supervised baselines, and find that each of the three word representations improves the accuracy of these baselines. We find further improvements by combining different word representations.
