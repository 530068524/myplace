We prove new results for both the RPTREE-MAX and the RPTREE-MEAN data structures. Our result for RPTREE-MAX gives a near-optimal bound on the number of levels required by this data structure to reduce the size of its cells by a factor s \u2265 2. We also prove a packing lemma for this data structure. Our final result shows that low-dimensional manifolds have bounded Local Covariance Dimension. As a consequence we show that RPTREE-MEAN adapts to manifold dimension as well.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur"], "authors": ["Aman Dhesi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dhesi:Aman", "Purushottam Kar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kar:Purushottam"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
