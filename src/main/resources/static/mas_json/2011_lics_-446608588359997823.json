{"title": "CoQMTU: A Higher-Order Type Theory with a Predicative Hierarchy of Universes Parametrized by a Decidable First-Order Theory.", "fields": ["subject reduction", "axiom", "predicative expression", "order type", "order theory"], "abstract": "We study a complex type theory, a Calculus of Inductive Constructions with a predicative hierarchy of universes and a first-order theory T built in its conversion relation. The theory T is specified abstractly, by a set of constructors, a set of defined symbols, axioms expressing that constructors are free and defined symbols completely defined, and a generic elimination principle relying on crucial properties of first-order structures satisfying the axioms. We first show that CoqMTU enjoys all basic meta-theoretical properties of such calculi, confluence, subject reduction and strong normalization when restricted to weak-elimination, implying the decidability of type-checking in this case as well as consistency. The case of strong elimination is left open.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Bruno Barras.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barras:Bruno", "Jean-Pierre Jouannaud.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jouannaud:Jean=Pierre", "Pierre-Yves Strub.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strub:Pierre=Yves", "Qian Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Qian"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
