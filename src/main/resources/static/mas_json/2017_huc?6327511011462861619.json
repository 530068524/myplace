Olfaction, i.e. the sense of smell, is used by humans as a sensorial information channel as an element for experiencing the environment. Olfactory sensations are closely linked to emotions and memories, but also notify about personal dangers such as fire or foulness. We utilize the properties of smell as a notification channel by amplifying received mobile notifications with artificially emitted scents. We built a wearable olfactory display that can be worn as a pendant around the neck and contains up to eight different scent aromas that can be inserted and quickly exchanged via small scent cartridges. Upon emission, scent aroma is vaporized and blown towards the user. A hardware - and software framework is presented that allows developers to add scents to their mobile applications.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Ulm", "University of Ulm", "University of Ulm"], "authors": ["David Dobbelstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dobbelstein:David", "Enrico Rukzio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rukzio:Enrico", "Steffen Herrdum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herrdum:Steffen"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 4}
