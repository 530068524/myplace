{"title": "Millions of little minions: using packets for low latency network programming and visibility.", "fields": ["netfpga", "network packet", "computer network programming", "active networking", "low latency"], "abstract": "This paper presents a practical approach to rapidly introducing new dataplane functionality into networks: End-hosts embed tiny programs into packets to actively query and manipulate a network's internal state. We show how this \"tiny packet program\" (TPP) interface gives end-hosts unprecedented visibility into network behavior, enabling them to work with the network to achieve a desired functionality. Our design leverages what each component does best: (a) switches forward and execute tiny packet programs (at most 5~instructions) in-band at line rate, and (b) end-hosts perform arbitrary (and easily updated) computation on network state. By implementing three different research proposals, we show that TPPs are useful. Using a hardware prototype on a NetFPGA, we show our design is feasible at a reasonable cost.", "citation": "Citations (69)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Cisco Systems, Inc.", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Barefoot Networ ... o Alto, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Vimalkumar Jeyakumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeyakumar:Vimalkumar", "Mohammad Alizadeh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alizadeh:Mohammad", "Yilong Geng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geng:Yilong", "Changhoon Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Changhoon", "David Mazi\u00e8res.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mazi=egrave=res:David"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
