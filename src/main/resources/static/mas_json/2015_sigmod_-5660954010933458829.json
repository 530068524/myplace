These data cover a wide range of topics. Users are interested in receiving a few up-to-date representative documents (e.g., tweets) that can provide them with a wide coverage of different aspects of their query topics. To address the problem, we consider the Diversity-Aware Top- k  Subscription ( DAS ) query. Given a  DAS  query, we continuously maintain an up-to-date result set that contains  k  most recently returned documents over a text stream for the query. The  DAS  query takes into account text relevance, document recency, and result diversity. We propose a novel solution to efficiently processing a large number of  DAS  queries over a stream of documents. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on real-world dataset and the experimental results show that our solution is able to achieve a reduction of the processing time by 60--75% compared with two baselines. We also study the effectiveness of the DAS query.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Lisi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lisi", "Gao Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Gao"], "pages": 16}
