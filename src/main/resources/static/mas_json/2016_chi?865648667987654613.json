{"title": "Changing Family Practices with Assistive Technology: MOBERO Improves Morning and Bedtime Routines for Children with ADHD.", "fields": ["behavior change", "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder", "bedtime", "frustration", "morning"], "abstract": "Families of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often report morning and bedtime routines to be stressful and frustrating. Through a design process involving domain professionals and families we designed MOBERO, a smartphone-based system that assists families in establishing healthy morning and bedtime routines with the aim to assist the child in becoming independent and lowering the parents' frustration levels. In a two-week intervention with 13 children with ADHD and their families, MOBERO significantly improved children's independence and reduced parents' frustration levels. Additionally, use of MOBERO was associated with a 16.5% reduction in core ADHD symptoms and an 8.3% improvement in the child's sleep habits, both measured by standardized questionnaires. Our study highlights the potential of assistive technologies to change the everyday practices of families of children with ADHD.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Aarhus University", "University College London", "Aarhus University", "Aarhus University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Tobias Sonne.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sonne:Tobias", "J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/M=uuml=ller_0001:J=ouml=rg", "Paul Marshall.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marshall:Paul", "Carsten Obel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Obel:Carsten", "Kaj Gr\u00f8nb\u00e6k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gr=oslash=nb=aelig=k:Kaj"], "pages": 13}
