{"title": "\"ClearPlate\" for capturing printed information: a scanner and viewfinder in one optical unit.", "fields": ["camera interface", "viewfinder", "smart camera", "barcode", "camera phone"], "abstract": "As it is becoming more common for various handheld devices to be equipped with a camera, applications that use image recognition are increasing. Therefore, improving the usability of these devices by enhancing their image capture characteristics is becoming more important. We present ClearPlate - a new optical unit for image capture. It has a physically transparent viewfinder through which the user can observe the target directly without offset; the framed image is captured by the built-in camera. We also present a user study that evaluates ClearPlate performance in the 2D barcode acquisition task. Results show that ClearPlate significantly outperforms the camera-phone-based approach with regard to 2D barcode acquisition.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "NTT Communications Corp", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "Okayama University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Atsuhiko Maeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maeda:Atsuhiko", "Kenji Hara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hara:Kenji", "Minoru Kobayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kobayashi:Minoru", "Masanobu Abe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abe:Masanobu"], "pages": 4}
