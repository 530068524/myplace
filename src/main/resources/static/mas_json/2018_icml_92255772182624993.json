{"title": "A Simple Stochastic Variance Reduced Algorithm with Fast Convergence Rates.", "fields": ["convex function", "convergence", "logistic regression", "asynchronous communication", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed exciting progress in the study of stochastic variance reduced gradient methods (e.g., SVRG, SAGA), their accelerated variants (e.g, Katyusha) and their extensions in many different settings (e.g., online, sparse, asynchronous, distributed). Among them, accelerated methods enjoy improved convergence rates but have complex coupling structures, which makes them hard to be extended to more settings (e.g., sparse and asynchronous) due to the existence of perturbation. In this paper, we introduce a simple stochastic variance reduced algorithm (MiG), which enjoys the best-known convergence rates for both strongly convex and non-strongly convex problems. Moreover, we also present its efficient sparse and asynchronous variants, and theoretically analyze its convergence rates in these settings. Finally, extensive experiments for various machine learning problems such as logistic regression are given to illustrate the practical improvement in both serial and asynchronous settings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Xidian University", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Kaiwen Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Kaiwen", "Fanhua Shang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shang:Fanhua", "James Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:James"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
