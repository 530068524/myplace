{"title": "A Type System for Complexity Flow Analysis.", "fields": ["polynomial", "p", "information flow", "imperative programming", "static analysis"], "abstract": "We propose a type system for an imperative programming language, which certifies program time bounds. This type system is based on secure flow information analysis. Each program variable has a level and we prevent information from flowing from low level to higher level variables. We also introduce a downgrading mechanism in order to delineate a broader class of programs. Thus, we propose a relation between security-typed language and implicit computational complexity. We establish a characterization of the class of polynomial time functions.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["INPL-ENSMN, Nan ... , Loria, France"], "authors": ["Jean-Yves Marion.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marion:Jean=Yves"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
