{"title": "Find the Conversation Killers: A Predictive Study of Thread-ending Posts.", "fields": ["deep learning", "encoding", "user experience design", "thread", "conversation"], "abstract": "How to improve the quality of conversations in online communities has attracted considerable attention recently. Having engaged, urbane, and reactive online conversations have a critical effect on the social life of Internet users. In this study, we are particularly interested in identifying a post in a multi-party conversation that is unlikely to be further replied to, which therefore kills that thread of the conversation. For this purpose, we propose a deep learning model called the ConverNet. ConverNet is attractive due to its capability of modeling the internal structure of a long conversation and its appropriate encoding of the contextual information of the conversation, through effective integration of attention mechanisms. Empirical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. For the widely concerned topic, our analysis also offers implications for improving the quality and user experience of online conversations.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Zhejiang University", "University of Michigan", "Zhejiang University", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Yunhao Jiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jiao:Yunhao", "Cheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Cheng", "Fei Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Fei", "Qiaozhu Mei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mei:Qiaozhu"], "conf": "www", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
