However, most existing semantic representation techniques cannot be used effectively for the representation of individual word senses. We put forward a novel multilingual concept representation, called MUFFIN, which not only enables accurate representation of word senses in different languages, but also provides multiple advantages over existing approaches. MUFFIN represents a given concept in a unified semantic space irrespective of the language of interest, enabling cross-lingual comparison of different concepts. We evaluate our approach in two different evaluation benchmarks, semantic similarity and Word Sense Disambiguation, reporting state-of-the-art performance on several standard datasets.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome", "Sapienza University of Rome"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Camacho-Collados.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Camacho=Collados:Jos=eacute=", "Mohammad Taher Pilehvar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilehvar:Mohammad_Taher", "Roberto Navigli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Navigli:Roberto"], "pages": 11}
