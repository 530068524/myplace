{"title": "A Computational Approach to the Automation of Creative Naming.", "fields": ["neologism", "machine learning", "pun", "natural language processing", "automation"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a computational approach to generate neologisms consisting of homophonic puns and metaphors based on the category of the service to be named and the properties to be underlined. We describe all the linguistic resources and natural language processing techniques that we have exploited for this task. Then, we analyze the performance of the system that we have developed. The empirical results show that our approach is generally effective and it constitutes a solid starting point for the automation of the naming process.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["FBK-Irst/Trento, Italy", "FBK-Irst/Trento, Italy"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["G\u00f6zde \u00d6zbal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/=/=Ouml=zbal:G=ouml=zde", "Carlo Strapparava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Strapparava:Carlo"], "pages": 9}
