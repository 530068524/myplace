In particular, influential bloggers can bring great business values to modern enterprise. Despite that several systems for mining influential bloggers are available, they measure the influence of bloggers in general rather than domain specific, which is not applicable for real application requirements, such as business advertisement, personalized recommendation and so on. In this paper, we propose an effective model to mine the top-k influential bloggers according to their interest domains, the impact and attitude of the comments to their posts, as well as their authority in the network of page links. In this demonstration, we present MASS, an effective system for mining influential bloggers. We will present the techniques in MASS, its experimental evaluation, as well as its applications.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Yichuan Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Yichuan", "Yi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen_0001:Yi"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
