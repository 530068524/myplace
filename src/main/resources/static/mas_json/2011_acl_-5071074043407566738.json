We also show how to reverse our technique to obtain new transition-based dependency parsers from existing tabular methods. Additionally, we provide a detailed discussion of the conditions under which the feature models commonly used in transition-based parsing can be integrated into our algorithms.", "citation": "Citations (58)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "University of Padua", "Universidade da Coru\u00f1a, Spain"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Marco Kuhlmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhlmann:Marco", "Carlos G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/G=oacute=mez=Rodr=iacute=guez:Carlos", "Giorgio Satta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Satta:Giorgio"], "pages": 10}
