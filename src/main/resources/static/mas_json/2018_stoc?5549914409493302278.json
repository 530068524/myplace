Our contributions are:    Mixture models with separated means: We study mixtures of poly( k )-many  k -dimensional distributions where the means of every pair of distributions are separated by at least  k  e . In the special case of spherical Gaussian mixtures, we give a  k   O (1/e) -time algorithm that learns the means assuming separation at least  k  e , for any e> 0. This is the first algorithm to improve on greedy (\u201csingle-linkage\u201d) and spectral clustering, breaking a long-standing barrier for efficient algorithms at separation  k  1/4 .    Robust estimation: When an unknown (1\u2212e)-fraction of  X  1 ,\u2026, X   n   are chosen from a sub-Gaussian distribution with mean \u00b5 but the remaining points are chosen adversarially, we give an algorithm recovering \u00b5 to error e 1\u22121/ t   in time  k   O ( t ) , so long as sub-Gaussian-ness up to  O ( t ) moments can be certified by a Sum of Squares proof. This is the first polynomial-time algorithm with guarantees approaching the information-theoretic limit for non-Gaussian distributions. Previous algorithms could not achieve error better than e 1/2 . As a corollary, we achieve similar results for robust covariance estimation.    Both of these results are based on a unified technique. Inspired by recent algorithms of Diakonikolas et al. in robust statistics, we devise an SDP based on the Sum of Squares method for the following setting: given  X  1 ,\u2026, X   n   \u2208 \u211d  k   for large  k  and  n  = poly( k ) with the promise that a subset of  X  1 ,\u2026, X   n   were sampled from a probability distribution with bounded moments, recover some information about that distribution.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Samuel B.
