Building with a Memory is an experiential media system that captures and represents human activity in a distributed workplace over time. The system senses and analyzes movement in two workspaces in a mixed-use building with the results rendered in an informative ambient display in the building entryway. We describe the design and development of the system, together with insights from two studies of the installation and promising future directions.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Andreea Danielescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danielescu:Andreea", "Ryan P.
