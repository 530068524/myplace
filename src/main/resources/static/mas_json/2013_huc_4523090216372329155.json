In this work, we present GALLAG Strip, an easy to use mobile and tangible tool that allows users to create context-aware applications without the need of programming experience. It enables programming by physical demonstration of envisioned interactions with the same sensors and objects that users will later encounter in their finished application. After an initial pilot to verify the usability of GALLAG Strip, we conducted a user study to evaluate the effects of tangible programming in terms of ease of use, engagement, and facilitation of the ideation process. We found that tangibility has both benefits and drawbacks, and suggest a mixed tangible and non-tangible approach for better user experience.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Jisoo Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jisoo", "Luis Gardu\u00f1o.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gardu=ntilde=o:Luis", "Erin Walker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walker:Erin", "Winslow Burleson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burleson:Winslow"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
