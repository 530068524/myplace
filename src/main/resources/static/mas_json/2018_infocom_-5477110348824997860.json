Despite significant progress on the physical layer development, the challenges associated with developing medium access control (MAC) protocols for heterogeneous networks composed of both legacy half-duplex (HD) and emerging FD devices have not been fully addressed. Therefore, we focus on the design and performance evaluation of scheduling algorithms for infrastructure-based heterogeneous networks (composed of HD and FD users). We develop the hybrid Greedy Maximal Scheduling (H-GMS) algorithm, which is tailored to the special characteristics of such heterogeneous networks and combines both centralized GMS and decentralized Q-CSMA mechanisms. Moreover, we prove that H-GMS is throughput-optimal. We then demonstrate by simple examples the benefits of adding FD nodes to a network. Finally, we evaluate the performance of H-GMS and its variants in terms of throughput, delay, and fairness between FD and HD users via extensive simulations. We show that in heterogeneous HD-FD networks, H-GMS achieves 5-10x better delay performance and improves fairness between HD and FD users by up to 50% compared with the fully decentralized Q-CSMA algorithm.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Columbia University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Columbia University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Tingjun Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Tingjun", "Jelena Diakonikolas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Diakonikolas:Jelena", "Javad Ghaderi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghaderi:Javad", "Gil Zussman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zussman:Gil"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
