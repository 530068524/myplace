Most past approaches to this problem fell short in one way or another, either limiting the language to an unusably small finitary fragment, or giving up important features of quantum physics such as entanglement. In this paper, we propose a denotational semantics for a quantum lambda calculus with recursion and an infinite data type, using constructions from quantitative semantics of linear logic.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "Dalhousie University", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Michele Pagani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pagani:Michele", "Peter Selinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Selinger:Peter", "Beno\u00eet Valiron.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Valiron:Beno=icirc=t"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
