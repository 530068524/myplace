{"title": "Depth Map Prediction from a Single Image using a Multi-Scale Deep Network.", "fields": ["training set", "depth map", "stack", "computer vision", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Predicting depth is an essential component in understanding the 3D geometry of a scene. While for stereo images local correspondence suffices for estimation, finding depth relations from a single image is less straightforward, requiring integration of both global and local information from various cues. Moreover, the task is inherently ambiguous, with a large source of uncertainty coming from the overall scale. In this paper, we present a new method that addresses this task by employing two deep network stacks: one that makes a coarse global prediction based on the entire image, and another that refines this prediction locally. We also apply a scale-invariant error to help measure depth relations rather than scale. By leveraging the raw datasets as large sources of training data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both NYU Depth and KITTI, and matches detailed depth boundaries without the need for superpixelation.", "citation": "Citations (659)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "New York University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["David Eigen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eigen:David", "Christian Puhrsch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Puhrsch:Christian", "Rob Fergus.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fergus:Rob"], "pages": 9}
