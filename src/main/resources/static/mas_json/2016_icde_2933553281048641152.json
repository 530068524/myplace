{"title": "InVerDa - co-existing schema versions made foolproof.", "fields": ["schema", "semantics", "schema migration", "software versioning", "database schema"], "abstract": "In modern software landscapes multiple applications usually share one database as their single point of truth. All these applications will evolve over time by their very nature. Often former versions need to stay available, so database developers find themselves maintaining co-existing schema version of multiple applications in multiple versions. This is highly error-prone and accounts for significant costs in software projects, as developers realize the translation of data accesses between schema versions with hand-written delta code. In this demo, we showcase INVERDA, a tool for integrated, robust, and easy to use database versioning. We rethink the way of specifying the evolution to new schema versions. Using the richer semantics of a descriptive database evolution language, we generate all required artifacts automatically and make database versioning foolproof.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology", "Dresden University of Technology"], "authors": ["Kai Herrmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Herrmann:Kai", "Hannes Voigt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voigt:Hannes", "Thorsten Seyschab.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seyschab:Thorsten", "Wolfgang Lehner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lehner:Wolfgang"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
