In this paper we present a new algorithm for (\u0394+1)-list coloring in the randomized LOCAL model running in  O (log \u2217  n  + Det  d  (poly log n )) time, where Det  d  ( n \u2032) is the deterministic complexity of (deg+1)-list coloring ( v \u2019s palette has size deg( v )+1) on  n \u2032-vertex graphs. This improves upon a previous randomized algorithm of Harris, Schneider, and Su (STOC 2016). with complexity  O (\u221alog\u0394 + loglog n  + Det  d  (poly log n )), and (when \u0394 is sufficiently large) is much faster than the best known deterministic algorithm of Fraigniaud, Heinrich, and Kosowski (FOCS 2016), with complexity  O (\u221a\u0394log 2.5 \u0394 + log *   n ).    Our algorithm appears to be optimal. It matches the \u03a9(log \u2217  n ) randomized lower bound, due to Naor (SIDMA 1991) and sort of matches the \u03a9(Det(poly log n )) randomized lower bound due to Chang, Kopelowitz, and Pettie (FOCS 2016), where Det is the deterministic complexity of (\u0394+1)-list coloring. The best known upper bounds on Det  d  ( n \u2032) and Det( n \u2032) are both 2  O (\u221alog n \u2032)  by Panconesi and Srinivasan (Journal of Algorithms 1996), and it is quite plausible that the complexities of both problems are the same, asymptotically.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Tsinghua University", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Yi-Jun Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:Yi=Jun", "Wenzheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenzheng", "Seth Pettie.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pettie:Seth"], "pages": 12}
