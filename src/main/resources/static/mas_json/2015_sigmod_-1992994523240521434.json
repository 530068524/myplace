{"title": "Output-sensitive Evaluation of Prioritized Skyline Queries.", "fields": ["data mining", "skyline", "machine learning", "artificial intelligence", "benchmarking"], "abstract": "Skylines  assume that all attributes are equally important, as each dimension can always be traded off for another. Prioritized skylines ( p-skylines ) take into account  non-compensatory  preferences, where some dimensions are deemed more important than others, and trade-offs are constrained by the relative importance of the attributes involved.   In this paper we show that querying using non-compensatory preferences is computationally efficient. We focus on preferences that are representable with p-expressions, and develop an efficient in-memory divide-and-conquer algorithm for answering  p-skyline  queries. Our algorithm is  output-sensitive ; this is very desirable in the context of preference queries, since the output is expected to be, on average, only a small fraction of the input. We prove that our method is well behaved in both the worst- and the average-case scenarios. Additionally, we develop a general framework for benchmarking p-skyline algorithms, showing how to sample prioritized preference relations uniformly, and how to highlight the effect of data correlation on performance. We conclude our study with extensive experimental results.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["State University of New York System", "Bloomberg L.P.", "University of Bologna", "State University of New York System"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Niccol\u00f2 Meneghetti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meneghetti:Niccol=ograve=", "Denis Mindolin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mindolin:Denis", "Paolo Ciaccia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ciaccia:Paolo", "Jan Chomicki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chomicki:Jan"], "pages": 13}
