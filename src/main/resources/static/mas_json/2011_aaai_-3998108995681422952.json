{"title": "Lossy Conservative Update (LCU) Sketch: Succinct Approximate Count Storage.", "fields": ["lossy compression", "sketch", "machine learning", "computation", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a variant of the conservative-update Count-Min sketch to further reduce the over-estimation error incurred. Inspired by ideas from lossy counting, we divide a stream of items into multiple windows, and decrement certain counts in the sketch at window boundaries. We refer to this approach as a lossy conservative update (LCU). The reduction in over-estimation error of counts comes at the cost of introducing under-estimation error in counts. However, in our intrinsic evaluations, we show that the reduction in over-estimation is much greater than the under-estimation error introduced by our method LCU. We apply our LCU framework to scale distributional similarity computations to web-scale corpora. We show that this technique is more efficient in terms of memory, and time, and more robust than conservative update with Count-Min (CU) sketch on this task.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "authors": ["Amit Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal_0001:Amit", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
