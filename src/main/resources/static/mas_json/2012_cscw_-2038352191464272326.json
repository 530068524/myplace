Through research into nine variations on the Arduino Duemilanove (an electronic circuit board) and interviews with their developers, we explore the process and outcome of open-source hardware development. We find a structure that differs substantially from that of most open-source software projects, involving many small-scale collaborations rather than a centralized process. We discuss three possible reasons for this structure: differing component selections, the investment required for prototyping, and the lack of software collaboration tools.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Massachusettes  ... sachusetts, USA", "Massachusettes  ... sachusetts, USA"], "authors": ["David Mellis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mellis:David", "Leah Buechley.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buechley:Leah"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
