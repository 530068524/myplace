In this paper we introduce and evaluate algorithms integrated into a cognitive architecture which allow an agent to learn about its environment while resolving references to both known and unknown locations. We also describe how multiple components in the architecture jointly facilitate these capabilities.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Tufts University", "Indiana University", "Tufts University", "Indiana University", "Tufts University"], "authors": ["Thomas Emrys Williams.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Williams:Thomas_Emrys", "Rehj Cantrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cantrell:Rehj", "Gordon Briggs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Briggs:Gordon", "Paul W.
