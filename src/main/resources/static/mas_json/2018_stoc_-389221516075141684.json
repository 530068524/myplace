{"title": "A tighter welfare guarantee for first-price auctions.", "fields": ["optimal mechanism", "statistical assumption", "common value auction", "smoothness", "welfare"], "abstract": "This paper proves that the welfare of the first price auction in Bayes-Nash equilibrium is at least a .743-fraction of the welfare of the optimal mechanism assuming agents\u2019 values are independently distributed. The previous best bound was 1\u22121/ e \u2248.63, derived using smoothness, the standard technique for reasoning about welfare of games in equilibrium. In the worst known example, the first price auction achieves a \u2248.869-fraction of the optimal welfare, far better than the theoretical guarantee. Despite this large gap, it was unclear whether the 1\u22121/ e  bound was tight. We prove that it is not. Our analysis eschews smoothness, and instead uses the independence assumption on agents\u2019 value distributions to give a more careful accounting of the welfare contribution of agents who win despite not having the highest value.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Oberlin College", "Shanghai University of Finance and Economics", "Tremor Technologies, USA"], "authors": ["Darrell Hoy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoy:Darrell", "Samuel Taggart.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taggart:Samuel", "Zihe Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Zihe"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2018", "pages": 6}
