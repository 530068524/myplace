{"title": "Investigating the Information Transfer Efficiency of a 3x3 Watch-back Tactile Display.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "user interface", "information transfer", "smartwatch", "guideline"], "abstract": "A watch-back tactile display (WBTD) is expected to be a viable supplement to the user interface limitations of a smartwatch. However, its design requires that many design parameters such as tactor types and stimulus patterns be determined. We conducted a series of experiments to explore the design space of a WBTD consisting of 3\u00d73 tactors. We demonstrated that tactor types and the temporal patterns and locus of a stimulus produce statistically significant effects on the efficiency of a WBTD. The experimental results can act as a practical guideline for the design of an efficient WBTD.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Jaeyeon Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Jaeyeon", "Jaehyun Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han:Jaehyun", "Geehyuk Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Geehyuk"], "pages": 4}
