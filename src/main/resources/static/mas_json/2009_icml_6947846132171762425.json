Methods that learn ranking functions are difficult to optimize, as ranking performance is typically judged by metrics that are not smooth. In this paper we propose a new listwise approach to learning to rank. Our method creates a conditional probability distribution over rankings assigned to documents for a given query, which permits gradient ascent optimization of the expected value of some performance measure. The rank probabilities take the form of a Boltzmann distribution, based on an energy function that depends on a scoring function composed of individual and pairwise potentials. Including pairwise potentials is a novel contribution, allowing the model to encode regularities in the relative scores of documents; existing models assign scores at test time based only on individual documents, with no pairwise constraints between documents. Experimental results on the LETOR3.0 data set show that our method out-performs existing learning approaches to ranking.", "citation": "Citations (100)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Maksims Volkovs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Volkovs:Maksims", "Richard S.
