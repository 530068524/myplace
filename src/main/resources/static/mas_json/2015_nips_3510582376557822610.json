{"title": "Column Selection via Adaptive Sampling.", "fields": ["adaptive sampling", "approximation error", "matrix", "selection algorithm", "sampling"], "abstract": "Selecting a good column (or row) subset of massive data matrices has found many applications in data analysis and machine learning. We propose a new adaptive sampling algorithm that can be used to improve any relative-error column selection algorithm. Our algorithm delivers a tighter theoretical bound on the approximation error which we also demonstrate empirically using two well known relative-error column subset selection algorithms. Our experimental results on synthetic and real-world data show that our algorithm outperforms non-adaptive sampling as well as prior adaptive sampling approaches.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["PayPal", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Saurabh Paul.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paul:Saurabh", "Malik Magdon-Ismail.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magdon=Ismail:Malik", "Petros Drineas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Drineas:Petros"], "pages": 9}
