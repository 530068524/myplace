State-of-the-art DVFS performance predictors, however, fail to accurately predict performance when confronted with realistic memory systems. We propose CRIT+BW, the first DVFS performance predictor designed for realistic memory systems. In particular, CRIT+BW takes into account both variable memory access latency and performance effects of prefetching. When evaluated with a realistic memory system, DVFS realizes 65% of potential energy savings when using CRIT+BW, compared to less than 34% when using previously proposed DVFS performance predictors.", "citation": "Citations (86)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "Nvidia", "University of Texas at Austin"], "authors": ["Rustam Miftakhutdinov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miftakhutdinov:Rustam", "Eiman Ebrahimi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ebrahimi:Eiman", "Yale N.
