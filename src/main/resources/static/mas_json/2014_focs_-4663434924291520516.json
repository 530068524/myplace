{"title": "Fixed-Parameter Tractable Canonization and Isomorphism Test for Graphs of Bounded Treewidth.", "fields": ["treewidth", "graph isomorphism", "graph canonization", "partial k tree", "clique width", "tremaux tree", "tree depth"], "abstract": "We give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm that, given a parameter k and two graphs G1, G2, either concludes that one of these graphs has treewidth at least k, or determines whether G1 and G2 are isomorphic. The running time of the algorithm on an n-vertex graph is 2O(k5 log k) n5, and this is the first fixed-parameter algorithm for Graph Isomorphism parameterized by treewidth. Our algorithm in fact solves the more general canonization problem. We namely design a procedure working in 2 O(k5 log k) n5 time that, for a given graph G on n vertices, either concludes that the treewidth of G is at least k, or finds an isomorphism-invariant construction term--an algebraic expression that encodes G together with a tree decomposition of G of width O(k4). Hence, a canonical graph isomorphic to G can be constructed by simply evaluating the obtained construction term, while the isomorphism test reduces to verifying whether the computed construction terms for G1 and G2 are equal.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Bergen", "University of Bergen", "University of Bergen", "University of Bergen"], "authors": ["Daniel Lokshtanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lokshtanov:Daniel", "Marcin Pilipczuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilipczuk:Marcin", "Michal Pilipczuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilipczuk:Michal", "Saket Saurabh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saurabh_0001:Saket"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
