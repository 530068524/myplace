We provide a detailed characterization of their knowledge of fundamental programming concepts elicited through card sorting. Additionally, we present qualitative findings regarding their motivation to learn new concepts and the learning strategies they employ. We find a high level of recognition of basic concepts, but we identify a number of concepts that they do not fully understand, consider difficult to learn, and use infrequently. We also note that their learning process is motivated by work projects and often follows a pattern of trial and error. We conclude with implications for end-user programming researchers.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Brian Dorn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dorn:Brian", "Mark Guzdial.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guzdial:Mark"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
