Despite its higher fault-detection ability over other structural testing techniques, practical DFT remains a significant challenge. This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a hybrid DFT framework: (1) The core of our framework is based on dynamic symbolic execution (DSE), enhanced with a novel guided path search to improve testing performance, and (2) we systematically cast the DFT problem as reach ability checking in software model checking to complement our DSE-based approach, yielding a practical hybrid DFT technique that combines the two approaches' respective strengths. Evaluated on both open source and industrial programs, our DSE-based approach improves DFT performance by 60~80% in terms of testing time compared with state-of-the-art search strategies, while our combined technique further reduces 40% testing time and improves data-flow coverage by 20% by eliminating infeasible test objectives. This combined approach also enables the cross-checking of each component for reliable and robust testing results.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["East China Normal University", "University of California, Davis", "East China Normal University", "East China Normal University", "University of California, Davis"], "authors": ["Ting Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Ting", "Zhoulai Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Zhoulai", "Geguang Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Geguang", "Jifeng He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Jifeng", "Zhendong Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Zhendong"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
