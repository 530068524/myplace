Story generation is knowledge-intensive; traditional story generators rely on a priori defined domain models about fictional worlds, including characters, places, and actions that can be performed. Manually authoring the domain models is costly and thus not scalable. We present a novel class of story generation system that can generate stories in an unknown domain. Our system (a) automatically learns a domain model by crowdsourcing a corpus of narrative examples and (b) generates stories by sampling from the space defined by the domain model. A large-scale evaluation shows that stories generated by our system for a previously unknown topic are comparable in quality to simple stories authored by untrained humans.", "citation": "Citations (108)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Boyang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Boyang", "Stephen Lee-Urban.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee=Urban:Stephen", "George Johnston.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johnston:George", "Mark Riedl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riedl:Mark"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
