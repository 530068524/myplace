We conducted a study to investigate the  natural use profiles  of PTA, which describes the features of PTA in the course of normal pen use such as writing and drawing. First, the study reveals the ranges of PTA in normal pen use, which can distinguish pen events accidently occurring in normal drawing and writing from those used for mode switch. The  natural use profiles  also show that azimuth is least likely to cause false pen mode switching while tip pressure is most likely to cause false pen mode switching. Second, the study reveals correlations among various modalities, indicating that pressure plus azimuth is superior to other pairs for dual-modality control.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Shenyang University of Technology", "University of Toronto", "Kochi University of Technology"], "authors": ["Yizhong Xin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xin:Yizhong", "Xiaojun Bi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bi:Xiaojun", "Xiangshi Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Xiangshi"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 4}
