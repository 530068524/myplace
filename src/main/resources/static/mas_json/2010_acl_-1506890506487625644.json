{"title": "The Influence of Discourse on Syntax: A Psycholinguistic Model of Sentence Processing.", "fields": ["sentence", "parsing", "cognitive architecture", "coreference", "sentence processing"], "abstract": "Probabilistic models of sentence comprehension are increasingly relevant to questions concerning human language processing. However, such models are often limited to syntactic factors. This paper introduces a novel sentence processing model that consists of a parser augmented with a probabilistic logic-based model of coreference resolution, which allows us to simulate how context interacts with syntax in a reading task. Our simulations show that a Weakly Interactive cognitive architecture can explain data which had been provided as evidence for the Strongly Interactive hypothesis.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Amit Dubey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dubey:Amit"], "pages": 10}
