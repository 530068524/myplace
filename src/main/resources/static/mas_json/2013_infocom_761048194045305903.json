We propose a geographic location free double-ruling-based scheme for large-scale 3D sensor networks. The proposed approach does not require a 3D sensor network with a regular cube shape or uniform node distribution. Without the knowledge of the geographic location and the distance bound, a data query simply travels along a simple curve with the guaranteed success to retrieve aggregated data through time and space with one or different types across the network. Simulations and comparisons show the proposed approach with low cost and a balanced traffic load.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "University of Louisiana at Lafayette", "University of Louisiana at Lafayette"], "authors": ["Yang Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Yang", "Miao Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Miao", "Yao Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Yao", "Hongyi Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Hongyi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 5}
