{"title": "Policy Evaluation Using the \u03a9-Return.", "fields": ["empirical research", "mathematical optimization", "econometrics", "computer science"], "abstract": "We propose the \u03a9-return as an alternative to the \u03bb-return currently used by the TD(\u03bb) family of algorithms. The benefit of the \u03a9-return is that it accounts for the correlation of different length returns. Because it is difficult to compute exactly, we suggest one way of approximating the \u03a9-return. We provide empirical studies that suggest that it is superior to the \u03bb-return and \u03b3-return for a variety of problems.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Texas at Austin", "Adobe Systems", "Duke University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Philip S.
