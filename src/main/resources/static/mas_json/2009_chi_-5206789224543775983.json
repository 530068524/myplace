Our aim is to explore how such an interactive surface can support and augment practices around VJing - a form of video performance art that is becoming increasingly popular in nightclubs and other music events. We conclude with observations from a field deployment, which highlight some initial thoughts and reflections on our design rationale.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Stuart Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor:Stuart", "Shahram Izadi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Izadi:Shahram", "David S.
