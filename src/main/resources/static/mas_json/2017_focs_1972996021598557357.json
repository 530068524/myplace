We study the problem of designing a data structure that given a data set P and a kernel function, returns approximations to the kernel density} of a query point in sublinear time}. We introduce a class of unbiased estimators for kernel density implemented through locality-sensitive hashing, and give general theorems bounding the variance of such estimators. These estimators give rise to efficient data structures for estimating the kernel density in high dimensions for a variety of commonly used kernels. Our work is the first to provide data-structures with theoretical guarantees that improve upon simple random sampling in high dimensions.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Moses Charikar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Charikar:Moses", "Paris Siminelakis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siminelakis:Paris"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 12}
