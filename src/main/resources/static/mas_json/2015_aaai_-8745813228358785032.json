Algorithms that address this problem have been used in areas which include, among others, sparse approximation, unsupervised feature selection, data mining, and knowledge representation. Such algorithms were investigated since the 1960's, with recent results that use randomization. The problem is believed to be NP-Hard, and to the best of our knowledge there are no previously published algorithms aimed at computing optimal solutions. We show how to model the problem as a graph search, and propose a heuristic based on eigenvalues of related matrices. Applying the A* search strategy with this heuristic is guaranteed to find the optimal solution. Experimental results on common datasets show that the proposed algorithm can effectively select columns from moderate size matrices, typically improving by orders of magnitude the run time of exhaustive search.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Hiromasa Arai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arai:Hiromasa", "Crystal Maung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maung:Crystal", "Haim Schweitzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schweitzer:Haim"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
