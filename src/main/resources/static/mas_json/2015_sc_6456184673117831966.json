The motivation for this work is the approximation of  kernel matrices , which appear in mathematical physics, approximation theory, non-parametric statistics, and machine learning. Existing fast multipole methods are asymptotically optimal, but the underlying constants scale quite badly with the ambient space dimension. We introduce a method that mitigates this shortcoming; it only requires kernel evaluations and scales well with the problem size, the number of processors, and the ambient dimension---as long as the intrinsic dimension of the dataset is small. We test the performance of our method on several synthetic datasets. As a highlight, our largest run was on an image dataset with 10 million points in 246 dimensions.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["William B.
