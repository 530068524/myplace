{"title": "Bayesian Budget Feasibility with Posted Pricing.", "fields": ["optimal mechanism", "crowdsourcing", "mechanism design", "public value", "submodular set function"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of budget feasible mechanism design proposed by Singer, but in a Bayesian setting. A principal has a public value for hiring a subset of the agents and a budget, while the agents have private costs for being hired. We consider both additive and submodular value functions of the principal. We show that there are simple, practical, ex post budget balanced posted pricing mechanisms that approximate the value obtained by the Bayesian optimal mechanism that is budget balanced only in expectation. A main motivating application for this work is crowdsourcing, e.g., on Mechanical Turk, where workers are drawn from a large population and posted pricing is standard. Our analysis methods relate to contention resolution schemes in submodular optimization of Vondrak et al. and the correlation gap analysis of Yan.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Northwestern University"], "authors": ["Eric Balkanski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Balkanski:Eric", "Jason D.
