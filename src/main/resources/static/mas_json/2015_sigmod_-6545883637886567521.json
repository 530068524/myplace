However, leaving the data management control to user's hands pushes the security issues to the user's platform. This demonstration presents a Secure Personal Cloud Platform relying on a query and access control engine embedded in a tamper resistant hardware device connected to the user's platform. The main difficulty lies in the design of an inverted document index and its related search and update algorithms capable of tackling the strong hardware constraints of these devices. We have implemented our engine on a real tamper resistant hardware device and present its capacity to regulate the access to a personal dataspace. The objective of this demonstration is to show (1) that secure hardware is a key enabler of the Personal Cloud paradigm and (2) that new embedded indexing and querying techniques can tackle the hardware constraints of tamper-resistant devices and provide scalable solutions for the Personal Cloud.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Saliha Lallali.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lallali:Saliha", "Nicolas Anciaux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anciaux:Nicolas", "Iulian Sandu Popa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popa:Iulian_Sandu", "Philippe Pucheral.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pucheral:Philippe"], "pages": 6}
