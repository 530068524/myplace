The goal is to formally prove that two versions of a program behave either equally or differently in a precisely specified way. In this paper, we present a novel automatic approach for regression verification that reduces the equivalence of two related imperative integer programs to Horn constraints over uninterpreted predicates. Subsequently, state-of-the-art SMT solvers are used to solve the constraints. We have implemented the approach, and our experiments show non-trivial integer programs that can now be proved equivalent without further user input.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Uppsala University", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Dennis Felsing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Felsing:Dennis", "Sarah Grebing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grebing:Sarah", "Vladimir Klebanov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Klebanov:Vladimir", "Philipp R\u00fcmmer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/R=uuml=mmer:Philipp", "Mattias Ulbrich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ulbrich:Mattias"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 12}
