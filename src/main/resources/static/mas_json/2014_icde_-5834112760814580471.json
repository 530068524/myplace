{"title": "iTag: Incentive-based tagging.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "budget constraint", "resource management", "incentive", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "In social tagging systems, such as Delicious 1  and Flickr 2 , users are allowed to annotate resources (e.g., Web URLs and images) with textual descriptions called tags. Tags have proven to be invaluable building blocks in algorithms for searching, mining and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users, and as a result, most tags are added to the few highly-popular resources, while most of the resources receive few tags. Crucially, this incomplete tagging on resources can severely affect the effectiveness of all tagging applications. We present iTag, an incentive-based tagging system, which aims at improving tagging quality of resources, by incentivizing taggers under budget constraints. Our system is built upon traditional crowdsourcing systems such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). In our demonstration, we will show how our system allows users to use simple but powerful strategies to significantly improve the tagging quality of resources.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong", "University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Siyu Lei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lei:Siyu", "Xuan S.
