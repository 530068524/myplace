{"title": "Joint Case Argument Identification for Japanese Predicate Argument Structure Analysis.", "fields": ["text corpus", "predicate", "bipartite graph", "natural language processing", "sentence"], "abstract": "Existing methods for Japanese predicate argument structure (PAS) analysis identify case arguments of each predicate without considering interactions between the target PAS and others in a sentence. However, the argument structures of the predicates in a sentence are semantically related to each other. This paper proposes new methods for Japanese PAS analysis to jointly identify case arguments of all predicates in a sentence by (1) modeling multiple PAS interactions with a bipartite graph and (2) approximately searching optimal PAS combinations. Performing experiments on the NAIST Text Corpus, we demonstrate that our joint analysis methods substantially outperform a strong baseline and are comparable to previous work.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology", "Nara Institute of Science and Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Hiroki Ouchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouchi:Hiroki", "Hiroyuki Shindo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shindo:Hiroyuki", "Kevin Duh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Duh:Kevin", "Yuji Matsumoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsumoto_0001:Yuji"], "pages": 10}
