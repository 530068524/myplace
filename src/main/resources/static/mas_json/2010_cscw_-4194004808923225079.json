{"title": "Readers are not free-riders: reading as a form of participation on wikipedia.", "fields": ["free rider problem", "free riding", "social computing", "legitimate peripheral participation", "complete information"], "abstract": "The success of Wikipedia as a large-scale collaborative effort has spurred researchers to examine the motivations and behaviors of Wikipedia's participants. However, this research has tended to focus on active involvement rather than more common forms of participation such as reading. In this paper we argue that Wikipedia's readers should not all be characterized as free-riders -- individuals who knowingly choose to take advantage of others' effort. Furthermore, we illustrate how readers provide a valuable service to Wikipedia. Finally, we use the notion of legitimate peripheral participation to argue that reading is a gateway activity through which newcomers learn about Wikipedia. We find support for our arguments in the results of a survey of Wikipedia usage and knowledge. Implications for future research and design are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (117)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Judd Antin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antin:Judd", "Coye Cheshire.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheshire:Coye"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 4}
