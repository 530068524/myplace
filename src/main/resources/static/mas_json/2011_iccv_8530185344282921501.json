We first represent a diffeomorphism by its Beltrami coefficient. Then it is possible to refine and inpaint the diffeomorphism by processing this Beltrami coefficient. With the inpainted/refined Beltrami coefficient, we construct a new diffeomorphism using the exact Beltrami holomorphic flow algorithm proposed in this paper. We apply our algorithms on several practical applications, which include the inpainting of a highly distorted diffeomorphism, the inpainting of image sequences of deforming shapes, the super-resolution of diffeomorphisms and the global parameterization of cortical surfaces by combining local parameterizations. Experiments show that our algorithm can solve these problems with natural and smooth results. We demonstrate how our proposed method can be widely applied in areas from texture mapping to video processing, and from computer graphics to medical imaging.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Los Angeles", "Stony Brook University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Tsz Wai Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Tsz_Wai", "Xianfeng Gu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gu:Xianfeng", "Tony F.
