We consider the problem of verifying functional correctness of periodic RTES, a popular variant of RTES that execute periodic tasks in an order determined by Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS). A computational model of a periodic RTES is a finite collection of terminating tasks that arrive periodically and must complete before their next arrival. We present an approach for time-bounded verification of safety properties in periodic RTES. Our approach is based on sequentialization. Given an RTES C and a time-bound W, we construct (and verify) a sequential program S that over-approximates all executions of C up to time W, while respecting priorities and bounds on the number of preemptions implied by RMS. Our algorithm supports partial-order reduction, preemption locks, and priority locks. We implemented our approach for C programs, with properties specified via user-provided assertions. We evaluated our tool on several realistic examples, and were able to detect a subtle concurrency issue in a robot controller.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "University of Texas at Austin", "Microsoft", "University of Texas at Austin", "Microsoft", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Imperial College London", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Princeton University", "University of California, San Diego", "Helsinki University of Technology", "Institute of Co ...
