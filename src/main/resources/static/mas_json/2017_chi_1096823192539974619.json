We argue that the 100-year floodplain standard that inform maps produced by the USA Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s National Floodplain Insurance Program (NFIP) represent a problematic form of discursive closure of scientific understanding of flood hazard. We show that in order to meet the requirements of the NFIP, this standard acts as a closure that conveys a certainty that the underlying science does not warrant and foreshortens dialogue on disaster risk and public understanding of flood hazard. Engaging with literature in science and technology studies and human-centered computing, we investigate design opportunities for resisting closure and supporting public formation through encounters with the uncertainty and complexities of risk information.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Robert Soden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Soden:Robert", "Leah Sprain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sprain:Leah", "Leysia Palen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palen:Leysia"], "pages": 12}
