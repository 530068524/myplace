We focus on motivations for, perceptions of, and practices surrounding the shared use of console games by a variety of established groups of gamers. These groups include both intragenerational groups of youth, adults, and elders as well as intergenerational families. Our analysis highlights the numerous ways that console games serve as a computational meeting place for a diverse population of gamers.", "citation": "Citations (138)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["University of Calgary", "University of Calgary"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Amy Voida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Voida:Amy", "Saul Greenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Greenberg:Saul"], "pages": 10}
