Unsupervised learning of these models is a form of discrete factor analysis, enabling the discovery of hidden variables and their causal relationships with observed data. We obtain an efficient learning algorithm for a family of Bayesian networks that we call quartet-learnable. For each latent variable, the existence of a singly-coupled quartet allows us to uniquely identify and learn all parameters involving that latent variable. We give a proof of the polynomial sample complexity of our learning algorithm, and experimentally compare it to variational EM.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"], "authors": ["Yacine Jernite.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jernite:Yacine", "Yonatan Halpern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Halpern:Yonatan", "David Sontag.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sontag:David"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
