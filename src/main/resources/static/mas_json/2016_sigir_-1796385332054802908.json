{"title": "Quit While Ahead: Evaluating Truncated Rankings.", "fields": ["ranking", "question answering", "computation", "truncate", "management information systems"], "abstract": "Many types of search tasks are answered through the computation of a ranked list of suggested answers. We re-examine the usual assumption that answer lists should be as long as possible, and suggest that when the number of matching items is potentially small -- perhaps even zero -- it may be more helpful to \"quit while ahead\", that is, to truncate the answer ranking earlier rather than later. To capture this effect, metrics are required which are attuned to the length of the ranking, and can handle cases in which there are no relevant documents. In this work we explore a generalized approach for representing truncated result sets, and propose modifications to a number of popular evaluation metrics.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne", "RMIT University"], "authors": ["Fei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0023:Fei", "Alistair Moffat.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moffat:Alistair", "Timothy Baldwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baldwin:Timothy", "Xiuzhen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xiuzhen"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
