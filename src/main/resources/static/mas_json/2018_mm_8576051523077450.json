Epitaxial films that are grown on LaAIO 3  substrates by laser ablation and suitably heat treated exhibit magnetoresistance values as high as 127,000 percent near 77 kelvin and \u223c1300 percent near room temperature. Such a phenomenon could be useful for various magnetic and electric device applications if the observed effects of material processing are optimized. Possible mechanisms for the observed effect are discussed.", "citation": "Citations (8,648)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "University of London", "University of Florida", "University of London", "University of London", "University of Patras", "University of Patras", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University", "National Institute for Materials Science", "National Institute for Materials Science", "Fujikura", "National Institute for Materials Science", "National Institute for Materials Science", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "Seoul National University", "2Bellcore, Red ...
