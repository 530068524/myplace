These reasons cause Imbalanced Multiple Noisy Labeling. To deal with the imbalance labeling issue, we propose an agnostic algorithm PLAT (Positive LAbel frequency Threshold) which does not need any information about quality of labelers and underlying class distribution. Simulations on eight real-world datasets with different underlying class distributions demonstrate that PLAT not only effectively deals with the imbalanced multiple noisy labeling problem that off-the-shelf agnostic methods cannot cope with, but also performs nearly the same as majority voting under the circumstances that labelers have no bias.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Hefei University of Technology", "University of Vermont", "University of Central Arkansas"], "authors": ["Jing Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0015:Jing", "Xindong Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xindong", "Victor Shengli Sheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheng:Victor_Shengli"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2013", "pages": -1}
