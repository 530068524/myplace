Although being designed to provide a coherent environment for interaction the system introduces a number of incongruities, both in time and space. Drawing on some quasi-naturalistic experiments, where the participants were required to analyse complex data, we consider how the participants manage these incongruities. We conclude by briefly discussing the resources people utilize to produce and recognize conduct in embodied spaces.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["King's College London", "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone", "University of Tsukuba", "King's College London"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Dingyun Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Dingyun", "Tom Gedeon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gedeon:Tom", "Ken Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor:Ken"], "pages": 10}
