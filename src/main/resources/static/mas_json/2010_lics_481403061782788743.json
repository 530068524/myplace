We introduce nondeterministic and alternating finite tree cost automata for describing cost functions. We show that all these forms of automata are effectively equivalent. We also provide decision procedures for them. Finally, following B\\\"uchi's seminal idea, we use cost automata for providing decision procedures for cost monadic logic, a quantitative extension of monadic second order logic.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Thomas Colcombet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colcombet:Thomas", "Christof L\u00f6ding.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/L=ouml=ding:Christof"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
