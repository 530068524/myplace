{"title": "Quantified reading and learning for sharing experiences.", "fields": ["bittorrent tracker", "toeic", "eye tracking", "reading", "experiential learning"], "abstract": "This paper presents two topics. The first is an overview of our recently started project called \"experiential supplement\", which is to transfer human experiences by recording and processing them to be acceptable by others. The second is sensing technologies for producing experiential supplements in the context of learning. Because a basic activity of learning is reading, we also deal with sensing of reading. Methods for quantifying the reading in terms of the number of read words, the period of reading, type of read documents, identifying read words are shown with experimental results. As for learning, we propose methods for estimating the English ability, confidence in answers to English questions, and estimating unknown words. The above are sensed by various sensors including eye trackers, EOG, EEG, and the first person vision.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Osaka Prefecture University", "Osaka Prefecture University", "Osaka Prefecture University", "Osaka Prefecture University", "Keio University"], "authors": ["Koichi Kise.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kise:Koichi", "Olivier Augereau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Augereau:Olivier", "Yuzuko Utsumi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Utsumi:Yuzuko", "Masakazu Iwamura.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwamura:Masakazu", "Kai Kunze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kunze:Kai", "Shoya Ishimaru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ishimaru:Shoya", "Andreas Dengel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dengel:Andreas"], "conf": "huc", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
