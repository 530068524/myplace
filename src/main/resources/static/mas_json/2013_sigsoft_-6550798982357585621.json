{"title": "BugMap: a topographic map of bugs.", "fields": ["topographic map", "source code", "software quality", "software visualization", "software system"], "abstract": "A large and complex software system could contain a large number of bugs. It is desirable for developers to understand how these bugs are distributed across the system, so they could have a better overview of software quality. In this paper, we describe BugMap, a tool we developed for visualizing large-scale bug location information. Taken source code and bug data as the input, BugMap can display bug localizations on a topographic map. By examining the topographic map, developers can understand how the components and files are affected by bugs. We apply this tool to visualize the distribution of Eclipse bugs across components/files. The results show that our tool is effective for understanding the overall quality status of a large-scale system and for identifying the problematic areas of the system.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University"], "authors": ["Jiangtao Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Jiangtao", "Hongyu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Hongyu"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
