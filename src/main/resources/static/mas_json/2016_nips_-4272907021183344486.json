{"title": "Breaking the Bandwidth Barrier: Geometrical Adaptive Entropy Estimation.", "fields": ["kernel", "mutual information", "estimator", "entropy", "order statistic", "entropy estimation"], "abstract": "Estimators of information theoretic measures, such as entropy and mutual information, are a basic workhorse for many downstream applications in modern data science. State-of-the-art approaches have been either geometric [nearest neighbor (NN)-based] or kernel-based (with a globally chosen bandwidth). In this paper, we combine both these approaches to design new estimators of entropy and mutual information that outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Our estimator uses local bandwidth choices of    $k$   -NN distances with a finite    $k$   , independent of the sample size. Such a local and data dependent choice ameliorates boundary bias and improves performance in practice, but the bandwidth is vanishing at a fast rate, leading to a non-vanishing bias. We show that the asymptotic bias of the proposed estimator is  universal ; it is independent of the underlying distribution. Hence, it can be precomputed and subtracted from the estimate. As a byproduct, we obtain a unified way of obtaining  both  the kernel and NN estimators. The corresponding theoretical contribution relating the asymptotic geometry of nearest neighbors to order statistics is of independent mathematical interest.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Weihao Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Weihao", "Sewoong Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Sewoong", "Pramod Viswanath.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Viswanath:Pramod"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
