{"title": "Time drives interaction: simulating sessions in diverse searching environments.", "fields": ["cognition", "computer science", "data mining"], "abstract": "Real life information retrieval takes place in sessions, where users search by iterating between various cognitive, perceptual and motor subtasks through an interactive interface. The sessions may follow diverse strategies, which, together with the interface characteristics, affect user effort (cost), experience and session effectiveness. In this paper we propose a pragmatic evaluation approach based on scenarios with explicit subtask costs. We study the limits of effectiveness of diverse interactive searching strategies in two searching environments (the scenarios) under overall cost constraints. This is based on a comprehensive simulation of 20 million sessions in each scenario. We analyze the effectiveness of the session strategies over time, and the properties of the most and the least effective sessions in each case. Furthermore, we will also contrast the proposed evaluation approach with the traditional one, rank based evaluation, and show how the latter may hide essential factors that affect users' performance and satisfaction - and gives even counter-intuitive results.", "citation": "Citations (51)", "departments": ["University of Tampere", "University of Tampere", "University of Tampere"], "authors": ["Feza Baskaya.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baskaya:Feza", "Heikki Keskustalo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Keskustalo:Heikki", "Kalervo J\u00e4rvelin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=auml=rvelin:Kalervo"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
