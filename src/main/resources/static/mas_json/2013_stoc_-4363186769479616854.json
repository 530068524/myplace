Answering two questions posed by Kannan and Lipton in the 1980s, we show that when  V  has dimension one, this problem is solvable in polynomial time, and when  V  has dimension two or three, the problem is in NP RP .", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ventsislav Chonev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chonev:Ventsislav", "Jo\u00ebl Ouaknine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouaknine:Jo=euml=l", "James Worrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Worrell_0001:James"], "pages": 10}
