Much progress has been made on local fitting from an initial guess, but determining a close enough initial guess is still an open problem. One approach is to detect distinct landmarks in the image and initalize the model fit from these correspondences. This is difficult, because detection of landmarks based only on the local appearance is inherently ambiguous. This makes it necessary to use global shape information for the detections. We propose a method to solve the combinatorial problem of selecting out of a large number of candidate landmark detections the configuration which is best supported by a shape model. Our method, as opposed to previous approaches, always finds the globally optimal configuration. The algorithm can be applied to a very general class of shape models and is independent of the underlying feature point detector. Its theoretic optimality is shown, and it is evaluated on a large face dataset.", "citation": "Citations (66)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Basel", "University of Basel"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Brian Amberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amberg:Brian", "Thomas Vetter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vetter:Thomas"], "pages": 8}
