We design a set of patterns for full coverage and two representative connectivity requirements, i.e. 14- and 6-connectivity. We prove their optimality under any ratio of the communication range over the sensing range among regular lattice deployment patterns. We also conduct a study on the proposed patterns under practical settings. To our knowledge, our work is the first one that provides deployment patterns with proven optimality that achieve both coverage and connectivity in three dimensional networks.", "citation": "Citations (89)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "City University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Xiaole Bai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bai:Xiaole", "Chuanlin Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chuanlin", "Dong Xuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xuan:Dong", "Weijia Jia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jia:Weijia"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
