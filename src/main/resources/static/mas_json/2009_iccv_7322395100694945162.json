{"title": "Image restoration using online photo collections.", "fields": ["prior probability", "color balance", "visual search", "image restoration", "pixel"], "abstract": "We present an image restoration method that leverages a large database of images gathered from the web. Given an input image, we execute an efficient visual search to find the closest images in the database; these images define the input's visual context. We use the visual context as an image-specific prior and show its value in a variety of image restoration operations, including white balance correction, exposure correction, and contrast enhancement. We evaluate our approach using a database of 1 million images downloaded from Flickr and demonstrate the effect of database size on performance. Our results show that priors based on the visual context consistently out-perform generic or even domain-specific priors for these operations.", "citation": "Citations (77)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Harvard University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "Adobe Systems", "Harvard University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Kevin Dale.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dale:Kevin", "Micah K.
