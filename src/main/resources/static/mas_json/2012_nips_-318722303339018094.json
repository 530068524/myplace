{"title": "Collaborative Ranking With 17 Parameters.", "fields": ["small set", "hyperparameter", "retraining", "ranking svm", "ranking"], "abstract": "The primary application of collaborate filtering (CF) is to recommend a small set of items to a user, which entails ranking. Most approaches, however, formulate the CF problem as rating prediction, overlooking the ranking perspective. In this work we present a method for collaborative ranking that leverages the strengths of the two main CF approaches, neighborhood- and model-based. Our novel method is highly efficient, with only seventeen parameters to optimize and a single hyperparameter to tune, and beats the state-of-the-art collaborative ranking methods. We also show that parameters learned on datasets from one item domain yield excellent results on a dataset from very different item domain, without any retraining.", "citation": "Citations (37)", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto"], "authors": ["Maksims Volkovs.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Volkovs:Maksims", "Richard S.
