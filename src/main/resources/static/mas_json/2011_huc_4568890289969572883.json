Through a twenty-participant field evaluation, we discovered how this new form of location-based asynchronous communication can be used to strengthen family relationships by encouraging communication across generations and enhancing users' relationships with everyday places in their lives.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Motorola", "Motorola", "Missouri Western State University"], "authors": ["Frank R.
