While previous work assumed a static camera, the addition of camera motion during the time-lapse creates a very compelling impression of parallax. Achieving this goal, however, requires addressing multiple technical challenges, including solving for time-varying depth maps, regularizing 3D point color profiles over time, and reconstructing high quality, hole-free images at every frame from the projected profiles. Our results show photorealistic time-lapses of skylines and natural scenes over many years, with dramatic parallax effects.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Google", "Google", "University of Washington", "Google", "University of Washington", "Google", "University of Washington"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Ricardo Martin-Brualla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Martin=Brualla:Ricardo", "David Gallup.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gallup:David", "Steven M.
