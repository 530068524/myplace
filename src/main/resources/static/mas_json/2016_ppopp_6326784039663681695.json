{"title": "Production-guided concurrency debugging.", "fields": ["debugging", "programming language", "parallel computing", "concurrency", "schedule"], "abstract": "Concurrency bugs that stem from schedule-dependent branches are hard to understand and debug, because their root causes imply not only different event orderings, but also changes in the control-flow between failing and non-failing executions. We present Cortex: a system that helps exposing and understanding concurrency bugs that result from schedule-dependent branches, without relying on information from failing executions. Cortex preemptively exposes failing executions by perturbing the order of events and control-flow behavior in non-failing schedules from production runs of a program. By leveraging this information from production runs, Cortex synthesizes executions to guide the search for failing schedules. Production-guided search helps cope with the large execution search space by targeting failing executions that are similar to observed non-failing executions. Evaluation on popular benchmarks shows that Cortex is able to expose failing schedules with only a few perturbations to non-failing executions, and takes a practical amount of time.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Lisbon", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Lisbon"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Nuno Machado.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Machado:Nuno", "Brandon Lucia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lucia:Brandon", "Lu\u00eds E.
