Although several active learning algorithms have been proposed to combine the two criteria for query selection, they are usually ad hoc in finding unlabeled instances that are both informative and representative. We address this challenge by a principled approach, termed QUIRE, based on the min-max view of active learning. The proposed approach provides a systematic way for measuring and combining the informativeness and representativeness of an instance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed QUIRE approach outperforms several state-of -the-art active learning approaches.", "citation": "Citations (241)", "departments": ["Nanjing University", "Michigan State University", "Nanjing University", "Nanjing University", "Michigan State University", "Nanjing University"], "authors": ["Sheng-Jun Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Sheng=Jun", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong", "Zhi-Hua Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Zhi=Hua"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2010", "pages": 9}
