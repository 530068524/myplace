In this paper we propose an algorithm for recursively constructing a hierarchy of topics from a collection of content-representative documents. We characterize each topic in the hierarchy by an integrated ranked list of mixed-length phrases. Our mining framework is based on a phrase-centric view for clustering, extracting, and ranking topical phrases. Experiments with datasets from three different domains illustrate our ability to generate hierarchies of high quality topics represented by meaningful phrases.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Chi Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Chi", "Marina Danilevsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Danilevsky:Marina", "Nihit Desai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Desai:Nihit", "Yinan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yinan", "Phuong Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Phuong", "Thrivikrama Taula.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taula:Thrivikrama", "Jiawei Han.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Han_0001:Jiawei"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
