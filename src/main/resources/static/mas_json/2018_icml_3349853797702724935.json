{"title": "Dynamic Evaluation of Neural Sequence Models.", "fields": ["treebank", "gradient descent", "pattern recognition", "recurrent neural network", "machine learning"], "abstract": "We present methodology for using dynamic evaluation to improve neural sequence models. Models are adapted to recent history via a gradient descent based mechanism, causing them to assign higher probabilities to re-occurring sequential patterns. Dynamic evaluation outperforms existing adaptation approaches in our comparisons. Dynamic evaluation improves the state-of-the-art word-level perplexities on the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 datasets to 51.1 and 44.3 respectively, and the state-of-the-art character-level cross-entropies on the text8 and Hutter Prize datasets to 1.19 bits/char and 1.08 bits/char respectively.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Ben Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause:Ben", "Emmanuel Kahembwe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kahembwe:Emmanuel", "Iain Murray.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murray_0001:Iain", "Steve Renals.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Renals:Steve"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
