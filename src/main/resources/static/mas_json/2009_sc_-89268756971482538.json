The challenge is twofold: to assemble this compound environment and to employ it for execution of a  mixture of throughput- and performance-oriented BOTs , with a dozen to millions of tasks each. Our generic mechanism allows per BOT specification of dynamic arbitrary scheduling and replication policies as a function of the system state, BOT execution state, and BOT priority.   We implement our mechanism in the  GridBot  system and demonstrate its capabilities in a production setup. GridBot has executed hundreds of BOTs with over 9 million jobs during three months alone; these have been invoked on 25,000 hosts, 15,000 from the Superlink@Technion community grid and the rest from the Technion campus grid, local clusters, the Open Science Grid, EGEE, and the UW Madison pool.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Mark Silberstein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Silberstein:Mark", "Artyom Sharov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sharov:Artyom", "Dan Geiger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geiger:Dan", "Assaf Schuster.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schuster:Assaf"], "pages": -1}
