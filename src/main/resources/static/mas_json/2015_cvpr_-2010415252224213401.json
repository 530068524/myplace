Our approach unites a discriminative image-based joint detection method with a model-based generative motion tracking algorithm through a combined pose optimization energy. The discriminative part-based pose detection method, implemented using Convolutional Networks (ConvNet), estimates unary potentials for each joint of a kinematic skeleton model. These unary potentials are used to probabilistically extract pose constraints for tracking by using weighted sampling from a pose posterior guided by the model. In the final energy, these constraints are combined with an appearance-based model-to-image similarity term. Poses can be computed very efficiently using iterative local optimization, as ConvNet detection is fast, and our formulation yields a combined pose estimation energy with analytic derivatives. In combination, this enables to track full articulated joint angles at state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal stability with a very low number of cameras.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["New York University", "New York University", "MPI Informatics ... r\u00fccken, Germany", "MPI Informatics ... r\u00fccken, Germany", "MPI Informatics ... r\u00fccken, Germany"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["A.
