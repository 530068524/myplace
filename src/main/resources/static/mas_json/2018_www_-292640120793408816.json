{"title": "Mapping the Invocation Structure of Online Political Interaction.", "fields": ["invocation", "viewpoints", "political spectrum", "vocabulary", "social media"], "abstract": "The surge in political information, discourse, and interaction has been one of the most important developments in social media over the past several years. Much of the contention takes place not just in the positioning of content at diverse points on an ideological spectrum, but also in the interaction among different viewpoints on this spectrum. However, we still have only a limited analytical vocabulary for expressing the ways in which these viewpoints interact. In this paper, we develop network-based methods that operate on a superposition of users and the content that they share; we construct \\emph{invocation graphs} on Web domains showing the extent to which links from one domain are invoked by users to reply to posts containing links from other domains. When the domains are located on a political spectrum induced from the data, we obtain an embedded graph showing how these interaction links span different distances on the spectrum. The structure of this embedded network, and its evolution over time, helps us derive macro-level insights about how political interaction unfolded through 2016, leading up to the US Presidential election. In particular, we find that the domains invoked in replies spanned increasing distances on the spectrum over the months approaching the election, and that there was clear asymmetry between the left-to-right and right-to-left patterns of linkage.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Cornell University", "University of Toronto", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Manish Raghavan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavan:Manish", "Ashton Anderson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anderson:Ashton", "Jon M.
