{"title": "Dependency Parsing with Bounded Block Degree and Well-nestedness via Lagrangian Relaxation and Branch-and-Bound.", "fields": ["bounded function", "lagrangian relaxation", "dependency grammar", "nestedness", "heuristic"], "abstract": "We present a novel dependency parsing method which enforces two structural properties on dependency trees: bounded block degree and well-nestedness. These properties are useful to better represent the set of admissible dependency structures in treebanks and connect dependency parsing to context-sensitive grammatical formalisms. We cast this problem as an Integer Linear Program that we solve with Lagrangian Relaxation from which we derive a heuristic and an exact method based on a Branch-and-Bound search. Experimentally, we see that these methods are efficient and competitive compared to a baseline unconstrained parser, while enforcing structural properties in all cases.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris", "University of Paris"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Caio Corro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Corro:Caio", "Joseph Le Roux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roux:Joseph_Le", "Mathieu Lacroix.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lacroix:Mathieu", "Antoine Rozenknop.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rozenknop:Antoine", "Roberto Wolfler Calvo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calvo:Roberto_Wolfler"], "pages": -1}
