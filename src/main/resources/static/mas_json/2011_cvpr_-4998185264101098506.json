These environments typically have the Manhattan world property that many surfaces are parallel to three principle ones. Further, the 3D geometry of the room and objects within it can largely be approximated by non overlapping simple structures such as single blocks (e.g. the room boundary), thin blocks (e.g. picture frames), and objects that are well modeled by single blocks (e.g. simple beds). We separately model the 3D geometry, the imaging process (camera parameters), and edge likelihood, to provide a generative statistical model for image data. We fit this model using data driven MCMC sampling. We combine reversible jump Metropolis Hastings samples for discrete changes in the model such as the number of blocks, and stochastic dynamics to estimate continuous parameter values in a particular parameter space that includes block positions, block sizes, and camera parameters. We tested our approach on two datasets using room box pixel orientation. Despite using only bounding box geometry and, in particular, not training on appearance, our method achieves results approaching those of others. We also introduce a new evaluation method for this domain based on ground truth camera parameters, which we found to be more sensitive to the task of understanding scene geometry.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "University of Arizona", "Heidelberg University", "University of Arizona"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Luca Del Pero.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pero:Luca_Del", "Jinyan Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Jinyan", "Ernesto Brau.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brau:Ernesto", "Joseph Schlecht.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schlecht:Joseph", "Kobus Barnard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barnard:Kobus"], "pages": 8}
