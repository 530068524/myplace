Counting fluent temporal logic is a formalism for specifying properties of event-based systems, which complements the notion of  fluent  by the related concept of counting fluent. While fluents allow us to capture boolean properties of the behaviour of a reactive system, counting fluents are numerical values, that enumerate event occurrences.   The tool supports a superset of FSP (Finite State Processes), that allows one to define LTL properties involving counting fluents, which can be model checked on FSP processes.
