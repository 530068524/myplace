We propose a new compilation approach called  abstraction-aware verifying compiler , in which abstraction is the target of compilation. Both a design model and its code are inputted as the first-class software modules to the compiler.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Kyushu University", "Kyushu University", "Kyushu University", "Kyushu University", "Kyushu University"], "authors": ["Naoyasu Ubayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/u/Ubayashi:Naoyasu", "Di Ai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ai:Di", "Peiyuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Peiyuan", "Yu Ning Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yu_Ning", "Shintaro Hosoai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hosoai:Shintaro", "Yasutaka Kamei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kamei:Yasutaka"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2014", "pages": 6}
