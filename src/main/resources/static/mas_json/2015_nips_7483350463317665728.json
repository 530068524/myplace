Our formalization in the context of infinite-horizon and finitely-nested interactive POMDPs (I-POMDP) is distinct from EM formulations for POMDPs and cooperative multiagent planning frameworks. We exploit the graphical model structure specific to I-POMDPs, and present a new approach based on block-coordinate descent for further speed up. Forward filtering-backward sampling - a combination of exact filtering with sampling - is explored to exploit problem structure.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Georgia", "Epic Systems Verona, WI"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Xia Qu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qu:Xia", "Prashant Doshi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Doshi:Prashant"], "pages": 9}
