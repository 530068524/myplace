Amongst the class of applications that can be supported is real time video services (such as IPTV, broadcast of live events etc.). These applications are bandwidth hungry and have stringent delay constraints. Thus, scalable support for such applications is a challenging problem. To address this challenge, we consider a combination of approaches using multicast, layer encoded video and adaptive modulation of transmissions. Using these, we develop algorithms to ensure efficient, fair and timely delivery of video in WiMAX networks. The corresponding resource allocation problem is challenging because scheduling decisions (within a WiMAX base station) are performed in real-time across two dimensions, time and frequency. Moreover, combining layered video with appropriate modulation calls for novel MAC algorithms. We model the multicast resource allocation problem in WiMAX and demonstrate this problem to be NP-hard. We present a fast greedy algorithm that is (i) provably within a constant approximation of the optimal solution (based on a metric that reflects video quality as perceived by the user), and (ii) performs within 87-95% of the optimal as demonstrated by realistic simulations. We also demonstrate that our algorithm offers a 25% improvement over a naive algorithm. Moreover, in terms of the average rate received by each user, our algorithm out-performs the naive algorithm by more than 50%.", "citation": "Citations (167)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Supratim Deb.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deb:Supratim", "Sharad Jaiswal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jaiswal:Sharad", "Kanthi Nagaraj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nagaraj:Kanthi"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
