It has been shown to offer higher bisection bandwidth and better permutation throughput than the corresponding fat-tree topology with a similar cost. In this work, we propose a new routing scheme for jellyfish that out-performs existing schemes by more effectively exploiting the path diversity, and comprehensively compare the performance of jellyfish and fat-tree topologies with HPC workloads. The results indicate that both jellyfish and fat-tree topologies offer comparable high performance for HPC workloads on systems that can be realized by 3-level fat-trees using the current technology and the corresponding jellyfish topologies with similar costs. Fat-trees are more effective for smaller systems while jellyfish is more scalable.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Florida State University", "Los Alamos National Laboratory", "Los Alamos National Laboratory"], "authors": ["Xin Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan_0001:Xin", "Santosh Mahapatra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahapatra:Santosh", "Wickus Nienaber.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nienaber:Wickus", "Scott Pakin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pakin:Scott", "Michael Lang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lang_0003:Michael"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2013", "pages": 11}
