Eco-routing, which enables drivers to use eco-friendly routes, is a simple and effective approach to reducing emissions from transportation. We present EcoSky, a system that annotates edges of a road network with time dependent and uncertain eco-weights using GPS data and that supports different types of eco-routing. Basic eco-routing returns the most eco-friendly routes; skyline eco-routing takes into account not only fuel consumption but also travel time and distance when computing eco-routes; and personalized eco-routing considers each driver's past behavior and accordingly suggests different routes to different drivers.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University", "Aalborg University"], "authors": ["Chenjuan Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Chenjuan", "Bin Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0002:Bin", "Ove Andersen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Andersen:Ove", "Christian S.
