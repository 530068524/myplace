The algorithm uses a figure-centric visual word representation. Different from previous approaches it does not require reliable human detection and tracking as input. Instead, the person location is treated as a latent variable that is inferred simultaneously with action recognition. A spatial model for an action is learned in a discriminative fashion under a figure-centric representation. Temporal smoothness over video sequences is also enforced. We present results on the UCF-Sports dataset, verifying the effectiveness of our model in situations where detection and tracking of individuals is challenging.", "citation": "Citations (192)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Simon Fraser University", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "Simon Fraser University"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Tian Lan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lan:Tian", "Yang Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0003:Yang", "Greg Mori.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mori:Greg"], "pages": 8}
