{"title": "Obfuscating the Topical Intention in Enterprise Text Search.", "fields": ["business information", "adversary", "full text search", "information privacy", "server"], "abstract": "The text search queries in an enterprise can reveal the users' topic of interest, and in turn confidential staff or business information. To safeguard the enterprise from consequences arising from a disclosure of the query traces, it is desirable to obfuscate the true user intention from the search engine, without requiring it to be re-engineered. In this paper, we advocate a unique approach to profile the topics that are relevant to the user intention. Based on this approach, we introduce an $(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2)$-privacy model that allows a user to stipulate that topics relevant to her intention at $\\epsilon_1$ level should appear to any adversary to be innocuous at $\\epsilon_2$ level. We then present a Top Priv algorithm to achieve the customized $(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2)$-privacy requirement of individual users through injecting automatically formulated fake queries. The advantages of Top Priv over existing techniques are confirmed through benchmark queries on a real corpus, with experiment settings fashioned after an enterprise search application.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Sch. of Inf.
