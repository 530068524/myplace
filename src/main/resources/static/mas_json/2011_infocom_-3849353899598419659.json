We develop a common modeling framework for the number of simultaneously present customers. Our approach has many novel elements: (a) We combine statistical clustering with Poisson regression from Generalized Linear Models to fit a non-stationary Poisson process to the arrival counts and demonstrate its remarkable accuracy; (b) We model the heavy tailed distribution of connection durations through fitting a Phase Type distribution to its logarithm so that not only the tail but also the overall distribution is well matched; (c) We obtain the distribution of the number of simultaneously present customers from an M t /G/\u221e queuing model using a novel regenerative argument that is transparent and avoids the customarily made assumption of the queue starting empty at an infinite past; (d) Most importantly, we validate our models by comparison of their predictions and confidence intervals against test data that is not used in fitting the models.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "departments": ["Princeton University", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs", "AT&T Labs"], "authors": ["Amitabha Amitava Ghosh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghosh:Amitabha_Amitava", "Rittwik Jana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jana:Rittwik", "V.
