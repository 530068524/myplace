Since exact inference is theoretically expensive, most probabilistic inference systems today have adopted approximate inference techniques, which trade precision for better performance (but often without guarantees). As a result, while desirable for its ultimate precision, the practical effectiveness of exact inference for probabilistic programs is mostly unknown.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Timon Gehr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gehr:Timon", "Sasa Misailovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Misailovic:Sasa", "Martin T.
