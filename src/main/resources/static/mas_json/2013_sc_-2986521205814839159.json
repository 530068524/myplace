{"title": "Using automated performance modeling to find scalability bugs in complex codes.", "fields": ["scaling", "scalability testing", "parallel computing", "scalability", "real time computing"], "abstract": "Many parallel applications suffer from latent performance limitations that may prevent them from scaling to larger machine sizes. Often, such scalability bugs manifest themselves only when an attempt to scale the code is actually being made---a point where remediation can be difficult. However, creating analytical performance models that would allow such issues to be pinpointed earlier is so laborious that application developers attempt it at most for a few selected kernels, running the risk of missing harmful bottlenecks. In this paper, we show how both coverage and speed of this scalability analysis can be substantially improved. Generating an empirical performance model automatically for each part of a parallel program, we can easily identify those parts that will reduce performance at larger core counts. Using a climate simulation as an example, we demonstrate that scalability bugs are not confined to those routines usually chosen as kernels.", "citation": "Citations (72)", "departments": ["RWTH Aachen University", "ETH Zurich", "RWTH Aachen University", "RWTH Aachen University"], "authors": ["Alexandru Calotoiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Calotoiu:Alexandru", "Torsten Hoefler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoefler:Torsten", "Marius Poke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Poke:Marius", "Felix Wolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wolf_0001:Felix"], "conf": "sc", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
