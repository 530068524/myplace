Previously, Guruswami et al. [1] showed that it is quasi-NP-hard to color 2-colorable 8-uniform hypergraphs with 22 O(vlog log n) colors. Their result is obtained by composing a standard Outer PCP with an Inner PCP based on the Short Code of super-constant degree. Our result is instead obtained by composing a new Outer PCP with an Inner PCP based on the Short Code of degree two.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["New York University", "IBM"], "authors": ["Subhash Khot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khot:Subhash", "Rishi Saket.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saket:Rishi"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
