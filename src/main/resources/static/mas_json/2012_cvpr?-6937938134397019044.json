Other than using the fundamental low-order linear combination model assumption, our method does not assume any extra prior knowledge either about the non-rigid structure or about the camera motions. Yet, it works effectively and reliably, producing optimal results, and not suffering from the inherent basis ambiguity issue which plagued most conventional NRSfM factorization methods. Our method is very simple to implement, which involves solving a very small SDP (semi-definite programming) of fixed size, and a nuclear-norm minimization problem. We also present theoretical analysis on the uniqueness and the relaxation gap of our solutions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real motion capture data (assuming following the low-order linear combination model) are conducted, which demonstrate that our method indeed outperforms most of the existing non-rigid factorization methods. This work offers not only new theoretical insight, but also a practical, everyday solution to NRSfM.", "citation": "Citations (156)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University", "Australian National University", "Northwestern Polytechnical University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Yuchao Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Yuchao", "Hongdong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hongdong", "Mingyi He.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/He:Mingyi"], "pages": 8}
