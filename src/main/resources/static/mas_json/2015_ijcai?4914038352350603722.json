As a result, learning translation models from nonparallel corpora has become increasingly important nowadays, especially for low-resource languages. In this work, we propose a joint model for iteratively learning parallel lexicons and phrases from non-parallel corpora. The model is trained using a Viterbi EM algorithm that alternates between constructing parallel phrases using lexicons and updating lexicons based on the constructed parallel phrases. Experiments on Chinese-English datasets show that our approach learns better parallel lexicons and phrases and improves translation performance significantly.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Tsinghua University", "Toshiba"], "authors": ["Meiping Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Meiping", "Yang Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Yang", "Huan-Bo Luan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luan:Huan=Bo", "Maosong Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun:Maosong", "Tatsuya Izuha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Izuha:Tatsuya", "Dakun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dakun"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
