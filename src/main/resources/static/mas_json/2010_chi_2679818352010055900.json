We present the results of a multi-site study aimed at understanding the use of video in several phases of law enforcement, from crime prevention and response to investigation and prosecution. Our findings show that while video has provided numerous benefits to law enforcement agencies, in many cases the technology either fails to support key facets of work or introduces new tasks that present an additional burden to workers. We discuss the need to incorporate human experience and tacit knowledge, operator engagement, and the greater ecosystem of work into video deployments.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Motorola", "University of Calgary", "Motorola", "Motorola", "Motorola"], "authors": ["Joe Tullio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tullio:Joe", "Elaine M.
