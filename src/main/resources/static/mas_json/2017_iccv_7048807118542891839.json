Structured vector quantizers based on product quantization and its variants are usually employed to achieve such compression while minimizing the loss of accuracy. Yet, unlike binary hashing schemes, these unsupervised methods have not yet benefited from the supervision, end-to-end learning and novel architectures ushered in by the deep learning revolution. We hence propose herein a novel method to make deep convolutional neural networks produce supervised, compact, structured binary codes for visual search. Our method makes use of a novel block-softmax nonlinearity and of batch-based entropy losses that together induce structure in the learned encodings. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art compact representations based on deep hashing or structured quantization in single and cross-domain category retrieval, instance retrieval and classification. We make our code and models publicly available online.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technicolor", "Technicolor", "Technicolor", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Technicolor", "Technicolor", "Technicolor", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Himalaya Jain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jain:Himalaya", "Joaquin Zepeda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zepeda:Joaquin", "Patrick P\u00e9rez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/P=eacute=rez:Patrick", "R\u00e9mi Gribonval.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gribonval:R=eacute=mi"], "pages": 10}
