{"title": "A Nonparametric Bayesian Model of Multi-Level Category Learning.", "fields": ["hierarchical dirichlet process", "tree structure", "nonparametric statistics", "inference", "bayesian inference"], "abstract": "Categories are often organized into hierarchical taxonomies, that is, tree structures where each node represents a labeled category, and a node's parent and children are, respectively, the category's supertype and subtypes. A natural question is whether it is possible to reconstruct category taxonomies in cases where we are not given explicit information about how categories are related to each other, but only a sample of observations of the members of each category. In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian model of multi-level category learning, an extension of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) that we call the tree-HDP. We demonstrate the ability of the tree-HDP to reconstruct simulated datasets of artificial taxonomies, and show that it produces similar performance to human learners on a taxonomy inference task.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "authors": ["Kevin Robert Canini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Canini:Kevin_Robert", "Thomas L.
