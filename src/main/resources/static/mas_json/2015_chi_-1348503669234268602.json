{"title": "From Third to Surveilled Place: The Mobile in Irish Pubs.", "fields": ["conversation", "irish", "qualitative research", "mobile technology", "mobile phone"], "abstract": "A home away from home, the pub is synonymous with good conversation. Yet, the art of conversation in pubs is changing with the ubiquity of mobile phones. We present a qualitative study spanning over three years describing experiences and rhetoric surrounding the relationship that mobiles have and should have with our conversation in the pub. We found that mobile phones are able to enhance conversation but can also cause a disruption to the informal and adhoc nature of pubs. The use of Facebook on mobile phones has also changed pubs from what Oldenburg terms a third space to a space that is potentially being surveilled. We suggest future designs should not necessarily discourage or encourage mobile use in pubs, but rather provoke us into reflecting on how intertwined modern conversation is with mobile technology in the context of the pub space.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Indiana University Bloomington", "Indiana University Bloomington"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Norman Makoto Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Norman_Makoto", "Lulu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lulu"], "pages": 10}
