{"title": "Collaborative workflow for crowdsourcing translation.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "knowledge management", "natural language processing", "workflow technology", "workflow"], "abstract": "In this paper we explore the challenges in crowdsourcing the task of translation over the web in which remotely located translators work on providing translations independent of each other. We then propose a collaborative workflow for crowdsourcing translation to address some of these challenges. In our pipeline model, the translators are working in phases where output from earlier phases can be enhanced in the subsequent phases. We also highlight some of the novel contributions of the pipeline model like assistive translation and translation synthesis that can leverage monolingual and bilingual speakers alike. We evaluate our approach by eliciting translations for both a minority-to-majority language pair and a minority-to-minority language pair. We observe that in both scenarios, our workflow produces better quality translations in a cost-effective manner, when compared to the traditional crowdsourcing workflow.", "citation": "Citations (53)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Vamshi Ambati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ambati:Vamshi", "Stephan Vogel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vogel:Stephan", "Jaime G.
