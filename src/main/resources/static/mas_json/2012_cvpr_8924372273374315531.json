The discrete approximation of differential operator on the underlying manifold represented by point clouds is based only on local approximation using nearest neighbors, which is simple, efficient and accurate. This allows us to extract the complete local geometry, solve partial differential equations and perform intrinsic calculations on surfaces. Since no mesh or parametrization is needed, our method can work with point clouds in any dimensions or co-dimensions or even with variable dimensions. The computation complexity scaled well with the number of points and the intrinsic dimensions (rather than the embedded dimensions). We use this method to define the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator on point clouds, which links local and global information together. With this operator, we propose a few key applications essential to geometric understanding for point clouds, including the computation of LB eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, the extraction of skeletons from point clouds, and the extraction of conformal structures from point clouds.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California, Irvine", "USC, Los Angeles, CA"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jian Liang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:Jian", "Rongjie Lai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lai:Rongjie", "Tsz Wai Wong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wong:Tsz_Wai", "Hongkai Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Hongkai"], "pages": 8}
