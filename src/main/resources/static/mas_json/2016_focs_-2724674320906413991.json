{"title": "The Multiparty Communication Complexity of Interleaved Group Products.", "fields": ["ak2", "special linear group", "communication complexity", "computation", "discrete mathematics", "mathematics", "pointwise product"], "abstract": "Party Ai of k parties A1, \u2026, Ak receives on its forehead a t-tuple (ai1, \u2026, ait) of elements from the group G = SL(2, q). The parties are promised that the interleaved product a11 \u2026 ak1a12 \u2026 ak2 \u2026 a1t \u2026 akt is equal either to the identity e or to some other fixed element g e G. Their goal is to determine which of e and g the interleaved product is equal to, using the least amount of communication. We show that for all fixed k and all sufficiently large t the communication is \u03a9(t log |G|), which is tight. As an application, we establish the security of the leakage-resilient circuits studied by Miles and Viola (STOC 2013) in the \"only computation leaks\" model. Our main technical contribution is of independent interest. We show that if X is a probability distribution on Gm such that any two coordinates are uniform in G2, then a pointwise product of s independent copies of X is nearly uniform in Gm, where s depends on m only.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Northeastern University"], "authors": ["W.
