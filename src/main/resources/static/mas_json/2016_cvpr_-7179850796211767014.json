Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promising performance on this task. Due to the large variability of shapes, accurate recognition relies on good estimates of model uncertainty, ignored in traditional training of DNNs, typically learned via stochastic optimization. This paper leverages recent advances in stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) to learn weight uncertainty in DNNs. It yields principled Bayesian interpretations for the commonly used Dropout/DropConnect techniques and incorporates them into the SG-MCMC framework. Extensive experiments on 2D & 3D shape datasets and various DNN models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over stochastic optimization. Our approach yields higher recognition accuracy when used in conjunction with Dropout and Batch-Normalization.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chunyuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chunyuan", "Andrew Stevens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stevens:Andrew", "Changyou Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Changyou", "Yunchen Pu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pu:Yunchen", "Zhe Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Zhe", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "pages": 10}
