{"title": "Pageforge: a near-memory content-aware page-merging architecture.", "fields": ["conventional memory", "uniform memory access", "demand paging", "registered memory", "computing with memory"], "abstract": "To reduce the memory requirements of virtualized environments, modern hypervisors are equipped with the capability to search the memory address space and merge identical pages --- a process called page deduplication. This process uses a combination of data hashing and exhaustive comparison of pages, which consumes processor cycles and pollutes caches.   In this paper, we present a lightweight hardware mechanism that augments the memory controller and performs the page merging process with minimal hypervisor involvement. Our concept, called  PageForge , is effective. It compares pages in the memory controller, and repurposes the Error Correction Codes (ECC) engine to generate accurate and inexpensive ECC-based hash keys. We evaluate PageForge with simulations of a 10-core processor with a virtual machine (VM) on each core, running a set of applications from the TailBench suite. When compared with RedHat's KSM, a state-of-the-art software implementation of page merging, PageForge attains identical savings in memory footprint while substantially reducing the overhead. Compared to a system without same-page merging, PageForge reduces the memory footprint by an average of 48%, enabling the deployment of twice as many VMs for the same physical memory. Importantly, it keeps the average latency overhead to 10%, and the 95 th  percentile tail latency to 11%. In contrast, in KSM, these latency overheads are 68% and 136%, respectively.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign"], "authors": ["Dimitrios Skarlatos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Skarlatos:Dimitrios", "Nam Sung Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Nam_Sung", "Josep Torrellas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torrellas:Josep"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
