Besides, when auxiliary annotations are available for specific data, simply ignoring them would be a great waste. In this paper, we incorporate these auxiliary annotations as privileged information and propose a novel CNN  model that is able to maximize inherent diversity of a CNN model such that the model can learn better feature representation with a stronger generalization ability. More specifically, we propose a group orthogonal convolutional neural network (GoCNN) to learn features from foreground and background in an orthogonal way by exploiting privileged information for optimization, which automatically emphasizes feature diversity within a single model. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC, well demonstrate the effectiveness and high generalization ability of our proposed GoCNN models.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Yunpeng Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yunpeng", "Xiaojie Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xiaojie", "Jiashi Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Jiashi", "Shuicheng Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Shuicheng"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
