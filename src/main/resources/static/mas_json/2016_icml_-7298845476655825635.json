In this paper, we show that SVRG is one such method: being originally designed for strongly convex objectives, it is also very robust in non-strongly convex or sum-of-nonconvex settings.\n\nMore precisely, we provide new analysis to improve the state-of-the-art running times in both settings by either applying SVRG or its novel variant. Since non-strongly convex objectives include important examples such as Lasso or logistic regression, and sum-of-non-convex objectives include famous examples such as stochastic PCA and is even believed to be related to training deep neural nets, our results also imply better performances in these applications.", "citation": "Citations (82)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Cornell University"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Zeyuan Allen Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Zeyuan_Allen", "Yang Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Yang"], "pages": 10}
