However, this is a weak notion of optimality; there might be long time intervals in which a client does not receive any packets, undesirable for real-time applications. Motivated by this, the authors, in an earlier work, introduced a pathwise cost function based on the law of the iterated logarithm, studied in fluctuation theory, which captures the deviation from a steady stream of packet deliveries and showed that a debt-based policy is optimal if the frame length is one. This work extends the analysis of debt-based policies to general frame lengths greater than one, as is important for general applications.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University", "Texas A&M University"], "authors": ["Rahul Singh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Singh:Rahul", "I-Hong Hou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hou:I=Hong", "P.
