GPUs rely on fast context switching between thousands of threads to hide long latency operations, however, they still stall due to the memory operations. To minimize the stalls, memory operations should be overlapped with other operations as much as possible to maximize memory-level parallelism (MLP). In this paper, we propose Earliest Load First ( ELF ) warp scheduling, which maximizes the MLP by giving higher priority to the warps that have the fewest instructions to the next memory load.  ELF  utilizes the same warp priority for the fetch scheduling so that both are coordinated. We also show that  ELF  reveals its full benefits when there are fewer memory conflicts and fetch stalls. Evaluations show that  ELF  can improve the performance by 4.1% and achieve total improvement of 11.9% when used with other techniques over commonly-used greedy-then-oldest scheduling.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "Hongik University", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Jason Jong Kyu Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Jason_Jong_Kyu", "Yongjun Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Yongjun", "Scott A.
