{"title": "Improving Component Dependency Resolution with Soft Constraints, Validation and Verification.", "fields": ["benchmark", "verification and validation", "component based software engineering", "traceability", "separation of concerns"], "abstract": "Software components are encapsulated units of execution which express dependencies through explicitly stated requirements and capabilities. These are used within component repositories to resolve sub-systems of deployable components. The main problem with this dependency resolution is not the lack of available solutions but the excess of them. Within current repositories the returned solution may not be optimal for the composers requirements and context. Improving dependency resolved solutions from repositories using soft constraints with validation and verification is the topic of our Ph.D. and discussed within this paper.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massey University"], "authors": ["Graham Jenson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jenson:Graham"], "conf": "kbse", "year": "2009", "pages": 5}
