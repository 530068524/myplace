{"title": "Premise Selection for Theorem Proving by Deep Graph Embedding.", "fields": ["deep learning", "voltage graph", "graph embedding", "null graph", "premise"], "abstract": "We propose a deep learning-based approach to the problem of premise selection: selecting mathematical statements relevant for proving a given conjecture. We represent a higher-order logic formula as a graph that is invariant to variable renaming but still fully preserves syntactic and semantic information. We then embed the graph into a vector via a novel embedding method that preserves the information of edge ordering. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the HolStep dataset, improving the classification accuracy from 83% to 90.3%.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Mingzhe Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Mingzhe", "Yihe Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Yihe", "Jian Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jian", "Jia Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Jia"], "pages": 11}
