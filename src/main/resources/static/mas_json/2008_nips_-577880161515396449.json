{"title": "The Infinite Hierarchical Factor Regression Model.", "fields": ["indian buffet process", "hierarchical database model", "coalescent theory", "factor regression model", "regression diagnostic"], "abstract": "We propose a nonparametric Bayesian factor regression model that accounts for uncertainty in the number of factors, and the relationship between factors. To accomplish this, we propose a sparse variant of the Indian Buffet Process and couple this with a hierarchical model over factors, based on Kingman's coalescent. We apply this model to two problems (factor analysis and factor regression) in gene-expression data analysis.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Piyush Rai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rai:Piyush", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "pages": 8}
