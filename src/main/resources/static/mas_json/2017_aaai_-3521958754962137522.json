The videos contain background and actions which are usually composed of ordered sub-actions. We refer the sub-actions and the background as semantic units. Considering the possible overlap between two adjacent semantic units, we propose a bidirectional sliding window method to generate the label distributions for various segments in the video. The label distribution covers a certain number of semantic unit labels, representing the degree to which each label describes the video segment. The mapping from a video segment to its label distribution is then learned by a Label Distribution Learning (LDL) algorithm. Based on the LDL model, a soft video parsing method with segmental regular grammars is proposed to construct a tree structure for the video. Each leaf of the tree stands for a video clip of background or sub-action. The proposed method shows promising results on the THUMOS\u201914, MSR-II and UCF101 datasets and its computational complexity is much less than the compared state-of-the-art video parsing method.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Southeast University", "Southeast University"], "authors": ["Xin Geng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geng:Xin", "Miaogen Ling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Ling:Miaogen"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
