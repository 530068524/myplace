{"title": "Exploiting ordered dictionaries to efficiently construct histograms with q-error guarantees in SAP HANA.", "fields": ["bounded function", "multiplicative function", "cardinality", "sap hana", "use case"], "abstract": "Histograms that guarantee a maximum multiplicative error (q-error) for estimates may significantly improve the plan quality of query optimizers. However, the construction time for histograms with maximum q-error was too high for practical use cases. In this paper we extend this concept with a threshold, i.e., an estimate or true cardinality \u03b8, below which we do not care about the q-error because we still expect optimal plans. This allows us to develop far more efficient construction algorithms for histograms with bounded error. The test for \u03b8, q-acceptability developed also exploits the order-preserving dictionary encoding of SAP HANA. We have integrated this family of histograms into SAP HANA, and we report on the construction time, histograms size, and estimation errors on real-world data sets. In virtually all cases the histograms can be constructed in far less than one second, requiring less than 5% of space compared to the original compressed data.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Mannheim", "SAP AG, Waterloo, Canada", "SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany", "SAP AG, Waterloo, Canada", "SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Guido Moerkotte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moerkotte:Guido", "David DeHaan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/DeHaan:David", "Norman May.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/May:Norman", "Anisoara Nica.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nica:Anisoara", "Alexander B\u00f6hm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=ouml=hm_0002:Alexander"], "pages": 12}
