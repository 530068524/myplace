This has made it necessary to subject component providers to access-control restrictions. What permissions should be granted to each component? Too few permissions may cause run-time authorization failures, too many constitute a security hole. We have designed and implemented a composite algorithm for precise static permission analysis for Java and the CLR. Unlike previous work, the analysis is modular and fully integrated with a novel slicing-based string analysis that is used to statically compute the string values defining a permission and disambiguate permission propagation paths. The results of our research prototype on production-level Java code support the effectiveness, practicality, and precision of our techniques, and show outstanding improvement over previous work.", "citation": "Citations (55)", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "Virginia Tech", "IBM"], "authors": ["Emmanuel Geay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Geay:Emmanuel", "Marco Pistoia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pistoia:Marco", "Takaaki Tateishi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tateishi:Takaaki", "Barbara G.
