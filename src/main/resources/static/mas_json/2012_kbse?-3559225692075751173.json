Empirical observations have shown that typically, the more complex the software is, the bigger the test suite is. Thence, a relevant question, which originated the main research topic of our work, has raised: \"Is there a way to correlate the complexity of the test cases utilized to test a software product with the complexity of the software under test?\". This work presents a new approach to infer software complexity with basis on the characteristics of automatically generated test cases. From these characteristics, we expect to create a test case profile for a software product, which will then be correlated to the complexity, as well as to other characteristics, of the software under test. This research is expected to provide developers and software architects with means to support and validate their decisions, as well as to observe the evolution of a software product during its life-cycle. Our work focuses on object-oriented software, and the corresponding test suites will be automatically generated through an emergent approach for creating test data named as Evolutionary Testing.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["University of Coimbra"], "conf": "kbse", "authors": ["Ana Filipa Nogueira.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nogueira:Ana_Filipa"], "pages": 4}
