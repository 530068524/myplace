First, a semantic network is automatically generated from large-scale English-Chinese bilingual parallel corpora to characterize the correlations between a large number of text terms of interest. Second, the semantic network is exploited to learn the statistical query translation models for such text terms of interest. Finally, these inter-related query translation models are used to translate the queries more precisely and achieve more effective CLIR. Our experiments on a large number of official public data have obtained very positive results.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "Fudan University", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yuejie Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yuejie", "Lei Cen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cen:Lei", "Cheng Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Cheng", "Xiangyang Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Xiangyang", "Jianping Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan_0001:Jianping"], "pages": 6}
