Pulmonary rehabilitation is effective in treating COPD. Rehabilitation, combining physical exercise with education, is usually undertaken in hospital or clinic-based groups led by a clinician. The support of the group is important. However, distance of travel, and mobility and transport problems can mean that patients are unable to participate. This paper describes a feasibility study to deliver a program to a group of patients in their own homes, improving accessibility. A novel videoconferencing system was installed in four patient's homes, connected to their TV and the Internet. A physiotherapist delivered a pulmonary rehabilitation program, involving twice-weekly exercise sessions for eight weeks. All were visible and audible to maintain the group-based approach of the conventional program. The technology performed well, satisfaction was high, and clinical improvements occurred in all patients, comparable to a conventional program. Larger studies are warranted.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Glasgow School of Art", "Raigmore Hospital", "LifeScan, Inver ... s, Scotland, UK", "Centre for Rura ... s, Scotland, UK"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Andrea Taylor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taylor:Andrea", "Angus Aitken.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Aitken:Angus", "David Godden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Godden:David", "Judith Colligan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Colligan:Judith"], "pages": 10}
