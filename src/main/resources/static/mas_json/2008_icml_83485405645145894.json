However, the choice of prior distribution significantly affects the empirical performance of the learning agent, and little work has been done extending existing methods for prior model selection to the online setting. This paper develops Replacing-Kernel RL, an online model selection method for GPTD using sequential Monte-Carlo methods. Replacing-Kernel RL is compared to standard GPTD and tile-coding on several RL domains, and is shown to yield significantly better asymptotic performance for many different kernel families. Furthermore, the resulting kernels capture an intuitively useful notion of prior state covariance that may nevertheless be difficult to capture manually.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "year": "2008", "departments": ["University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin", "University of Texas at Austin"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Joseph Reisinger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reisinger:Joseph", "Peter Stone.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stone:Peter", "Risto Miikkulainen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miikkulainen:Risto"], "pages": 8}
