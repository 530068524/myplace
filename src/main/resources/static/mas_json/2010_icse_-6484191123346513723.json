{"title": "The educational value of mapping studies of software engineering literature.", "fields": ["systems engineering", "systematic review", "supervisor", "further education", "software"], "abstract": "We identify three challenges related to the provenance of the material we use in teaching software engineering. We suggest that these challenges can be addressed by using evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) and its primary tool of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). This paper aims to assess the educational and scientific value of undergraduate and postgraduate students undertaking a specific form of SLR called a mapping study. Using a case study methodology, we asked three postgraduate students and three undergraduates and their supervisor to complete a questionnaire concerning the educational value of mapping studies and any problems they experienced. Students found undertaking a mapping study to be a valuable experience providing both reusable research skills and a good overview of a research topic. Postgraduates found it useful as a starting point for their studies. Undergraduates reported problems undertaking the study in the required timescales. Searching and classifying the literature was difficult.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Keele University", "Keele University", "Durham University"], "authors": ["Barbara A.
