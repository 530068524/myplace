{"title": "Query Processing Techniques for Big Spatial-Keyword Data.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "mobile web", "popularity", "scalability", "big data"], "abstract": "The widespread use of GPS-enabled cellular devices, i.e., smart phones, led to the popularity of numerous mobile applications, e.g., social networks, micro-blogs, mobile web search, and crowd-powered reviews. These applications generate large amounts of geo-tagged textual data, i.e., spatial-keyword data. This data needs to be processed and queried at an unprecedented scale. The management of spatial-keyword data at this scale goes beyond the capabilities of centralized systems. We live in the era of big data and the big data model is currently been used to address scalability issues in various application domains. This has led to the development of various big spatial-keyword processing systems. These systems are designed to ingest, store, index, and query huge amounts of  spatial-keyword  data. In this 1.5 hour tutorial, we explore recent research efforts in the area of big spatial-keyword processing. First, we give main motivations behind big spatial-keyword systems with real-life applications. We describe the main models for big spatial-keyword processing, and list the popular spatial-keyword queries. Then, we present the approaches that have been adopted in big spatial-keyword processing systems with special attention to data indexing and spatial and keyword data partitioning. Finally, we conclude this tutorial with a discussion on some of the open problems and research directions in the area of big spatial-keyword query processing.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Purdue University", "Purdue University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Ahmed R.
