Currently, patients undergoing knee rehabilitation have limited ways of assessing exercise form and extent of movement at home. To address this issue, we developed an exploratory wearable electronic prototype to visualize knee bend. We evaluated the device with physical therapy patients to get feedback on the design and to help us understand some of the challenges they face. We discovered that our current design is better suited for patients recovering from surgery as opposed to patients with chronic conditions.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "authors": ["Swamy Ananthanarayan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ananthanarayan:Swamy", "Miranda Sheh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sheh:Miranda", "Alice Chien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chien:Alice", "Halley Profita.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Profita:Halley", "Katie A.
