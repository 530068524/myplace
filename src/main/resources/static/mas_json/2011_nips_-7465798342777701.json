In fact, for our application, minimum norm can have a running time of about O(n7) (O(n5) oracle calls). We therefore propose a fast approximate method to minimize arbitrary submodular functions. For a large sub-class of submodular functions, the algorithm is exact. Other submodular functions are iteratively approximated by tight submodular upper bounds, and then repeatedly optimized. We show theoretical properties, and empirical results suggest significant speedups over minimum norm while retaining higher accuracies.", "citation": "Citations (52)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "authors": ["Stefanie Jegelka.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jegelka:Stefanie", "Hui Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Hui", "Jeff A.
