The proposed approach decomposes the original set of constraints into smaller subsets, and uses learning algorithms to propose sequences of abstractions that take the form of conjunctions of classifiers. The core procedure is a refinement loop that keeps improving the learned results based on counterexamples that are obtained from partial constraints that are easy to solve. Experiments show that the proposed techniques significantly improved the performance of state-of-the-art constraint solvers on many challenging benchmarks. The mechanism is capable of producing intermediate symbolic abstractions that are also important for many applications and for understanding the internal structures of hard constraint solving problems.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology", "Toyota", "University of California, San Diego", "California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Sumanth Dathathri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dathathri:Sumanth", "Nikos Arechiga.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arechiga:Nikos", "Sicun Gao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gao:Sicun", "Richard M.
