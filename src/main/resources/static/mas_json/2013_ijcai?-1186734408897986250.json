{"title": "Refining Incomplete Planning Domain Models Through Plan Traces.", "fields": ["scratch", "precondition", "domain model", "robustness", "macro"], "abstract": "Most existing work on learning planning models assumes that the entire model needs to be learned from scratch. A more realistic situation is that the planning agent has an incomplete model which it needs to refine through learning. In this paper we propose and evaluate a method for doing this. Our method takes as input an incomplete model (with missing preconditions and effects in the actions), as well as a set of plan traces that are known to be correct. It outputs a \"refined\" model that not only captures additional precondition/effect knowledge about the given actions, but also \"macro actions\". We use a MAX-SAT framework for learning, where the constraints are derived from the executability of the given plan traces, as well as the preconditions/ effects of the given incomplete model. Unlike traditional macro-action learners which use macros to increase the efficiency of planning (in the context of a complete model), our motivation for learning macros is to increase the accuracy (robustness) of the plans generated with the refined model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a systematic empirical evaluation.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Hankz Hankui Zhuo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhuo:Hankz_Hankui", "Tuan Anh Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen_0001:Tuan_Anh", "Subbarao Kambhampati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kambhampati:Subbarao"], "pages": 8}
