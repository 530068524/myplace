Model checking CSL formulae over CTMDPs requires then the computation of optimal control strategies to prove or disprove a formula. The paper presents a conservative extension of CSL over CTMDPs--with rewards--and exploits established results for CTMDPs for model checking CSL. A new numerical approach based on uniformization is devised to compute time bounded reachability results for time dependent control strategies. Experimental evidence is given showing the efficiency of the approach.", "citation": "Citations (25)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Technical University of Dortmund", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Technical University of Denmark"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Peter Buchholz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Buchholz_0001:Peter", "Ernst Moritz Hahn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hahn:Ernst_Moritz", "Holger Hermanns.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hermanns:Holger", "Lijun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Lijun"], "pages": 18}
