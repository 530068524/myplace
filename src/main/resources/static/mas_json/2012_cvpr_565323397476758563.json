To address these challenges, we propose a multi-view hair reconstruction algorithm based on orientation fields with structure-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that while hair's color appearance is view-dependent, the response to oriented filters that captures the local hair orientation is more stable. We apply the structure-aware aggregation to the MRF matching energy to enforce the structural continuities implied from the local hair orientations. Multiple depth maps from the MRF optimization are then fused into a globally consistent hair geometry with a template refinement procedure. Compared to the state-of-the-art color-based methods, our method faithfully reconstructs detailed hair structures. We demonstrate the results for a number of hair styles, ranging from straight to curly, and show that our framework is suitable for capturing hair in motion.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Princeton University", "Columbia University", "Adobe Systems", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Linjie Luo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Luo:Linjie", "Hao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Hao", "Sylvain Paris.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paris:Sylvain", "Thibaut Weise.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weise:Thibaut", "Mark Pauly.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pauly:Mark", "Szymon Rusinkiewicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rusinkiewicz:Szymon"], "pages": 8}
