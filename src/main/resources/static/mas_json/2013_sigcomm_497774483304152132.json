However, adoption of NFC-enabled applications has been stymied by the low levels of penetration of NFC hardware. In this paper, we address the challenge of enabling NFC-like capability on the existing base of mobile phones. To this end, we develop Dhwani, a novel, acoustics-based NFC system that uses the microphone and speakers on mobile phones, thus eliminating the need for any specialized NFC hardware. A key feature of Dhwani is the JamSecure technique, which uses self-jamming coupled with self-interference cancellation at the receiver, to provide an information-theoretically secure communication channel between the devices. Our current implementation of Dhwani achieves data rates of up to 2.4 Kbps, which is sufficient for most existing NFC applications.", "citation": "Citations (90)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Rajalakshmi Nandakumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nandakumar:Rajalakshmi", "Krishna Kant Chintalapudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chintalapudi:Krishna_Kant", "Venkata N.
