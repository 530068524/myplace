Without strong incentives and location privacy protection in place, however, mobile users will be reluctant to act as mobile crowdsourcing workers for spectrum sensing tasks. In this paper, we present PriCSS, the first framework for a crowdsourced spectrum sensing service provider to select spectrum-sensing participants in a differentially privacy-preserving manner. Thorough theoretical analysis and simulation studies show that PriCSS can simultaneously achieve differential location privacy, approximate social cost minimization, and truthfulness.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University", "Arizona State University"], "authors": ["Xiaocong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Xiaocong", "Yanchao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yanchao"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
