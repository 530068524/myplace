The developed algorithm is a branch-and-bound-based algorithm which responds to the structure of this problem through the relationship between submodularity and convexity. The D.S. programming problem covers a broad range of applications in machine learning. In fact, this generalizes any set-function optimization. We empirically investigate the performance of our algorithm, and illustrate the difference between exact and approximate solutions respectively obtained by the proposed and existing algorithms in feature selection and discriminative structure learning.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Osaka University"], "authors": ["Liefeng Bo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bo:Liefeng", "Xiaofeng Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Xiaofeng", "Dieter Fox.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fox:Dieter"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
