{"title": "Exploiting semantic commutativity in hardware speculation.", "fields": ["serialization", "exploit", "transactional memory", "commutative property", "work stealing"], "abstract": "Hardware speculative execution schemes such as hardware transactional memory (HTM) enjoy low run-time overheads but suffer from limited concurrency because they rely on reads and writes to detect conflicts. By contrast, software speculation schemes can exploit semantic knowledge of concurrent operations to reduce conflicts. In particular, they often exploit that many operations on shared data, like insertions into sets, are  semantically commutative : they produce semantically equivalent results when reordered. However, software techniques often incur unacceptable run-time overheads.   To solve this dichotomy, we present C omm TM, an HTM that exploits semantic commutativity. C omm TM extends the coherence protocol and conflict detection scheme to support user-defined commutative operations. Multiple cores can perform commutative operations to the same data concurrently and without conflicts. C omm TM preserves transactional guarantees and can be applied to arbitrary HTMs.   C omm TM scales on many operations that serialize in conventional HTMs, like set insertions, reference counting, and top-K insertions, and retains the low overhead of HTMs. As a result, at 128 cores, C omm TM outperforms a conventional eager-lazy HTM by up to 3.4X and reduces or eliminates aborts.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Guowei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Guowei", "Virginia Chiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chiu:Virginia", "Daniel S\u00e1nchez.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/S=aacute=nchez_0003:Daniel"], "conf": "micro", "year": "2016", "pages": 12}
