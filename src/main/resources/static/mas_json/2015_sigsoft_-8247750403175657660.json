In this paper, we introduce DEXTERJS, a testing platform for detecting and validating DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities on web applications. DEXTERJS leverages source-to source rewriting to carry out character-precise taint tracking when executing in the browser context\u2014thus being able to identify vulnerable information flows in a web page. By scanning a web page, DEXTERJS produces working exploits that validate DOM-based XSS vulnerability on the page. DEXTERJS is robust, has been tested on Alexa\u2019s top 1000 sites, and has found a total of 820 distinct zero-day DOM-XSS confirmed exploits automatically.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore"], "authors": ["Inian Parameshwaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Parameshwaran:Inian", "Enrico Budianto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Budianto:Enrico", "Shweta Shinde.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shinde:Shweta", "Hung Dang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dang:Hung", "Atul Sadhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sadhu:Atul", "Prateek Saxena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saxena:Prateek"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
