{"title": "A general technique for non-blocking trees.", "fields": ["order statistic tree", "fractal tree index", "left child right sibling binary tree", "vantage point tree", "exponential tree"], "abstract": "We describe a general technique for obtaining provably correct, non-blocking implementations of a large class of tree data structures where pointers are directed from parents to children. Updates are permitted to modify any contiguous portion of the tree atomically. Our non-blocking algorithms make use of the LLX, SCX and VLX primitives, which are multi-word generalizations of the standard LL, SC and VL primitives and have been implemented from single-word CAS. To illustrate our technique, we describe how it can be used in a fairly straightforward way to obtain a non-blocking implementation of a chromatic tree, which is a relaxed variant of a red-black tree. The height of the tree at any time is O(c + log n), where n is the number of keys and c is the number of updates in progress. We provide an experimental performance analysis which demonstrates that our Java implementation of a chromatic tree rivals, and often significantly outperforms, other leading concurrent dictionaries.", "citation": "Citations (67)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Toronto", "University of Toronto", "York University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Trevor Brown.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Brown_0001:Trevor", "Faith Ellen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ellen:Faith", "Eric Ruppert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruppert:Eric"], "pages": 14}
