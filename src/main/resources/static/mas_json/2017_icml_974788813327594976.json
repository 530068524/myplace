In this problem, we consider two types of generalizations: to previously unseen instructions and to longer sequences of instructions. For generalization over unseen instructions, we propose a new objective which encourages learning correspondences between similar subtasks by making analogies. For generalization over sequential instructions, we present a hierarchical architecture where a meta controller learns to use the acquired skills for executing the instructions. To deal with delayed reward, we propose a new neural architecture in the meta controller that learns when to update the subtask, which makes learning more efficient. Experimental results on a stochastic 3D domain show that the proposed ideas are crucial for generalization to longer instructions as well as unseen instructions.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "Microsoft"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Junhyuk Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Junhyuk", "Satinder P.
