{"title": "Experimental specification mining for enterprise applications.", "fields": ["test case", "theoretical computer science", "abstraction", "model based testing", "enterprise system"], "abstract": "Specification mining infers abstractions over a set of program execution traces. Whereas inductive approaches to specification mining rely on a given set of execution traces, experimental approaches systematically generate and execute test cases to infer rich models including uncommon and exceptional behavior. State-of-the-art experimental mining approaches infer low-level models representing the behavior of single classes. This paper proposes an approach for inferring models of built-in processes in enterprise systems based on systematic scenario test generation. The paper motivates the approach, sketches the relevant concepts and challenges, and discusses related work.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["SAP Research, D ... mstadt, Germany"], "authors": ["Matthias Schur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schur:Matthias"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
