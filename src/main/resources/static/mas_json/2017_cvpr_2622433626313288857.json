{"title": "Simultaneous Visual Data Completion and Denoising Based on Tensor Rank and Total Variation Minimization and Its Primal-Dual Splitting Algorithm.", "fields": ["matrix norm", "convex function", "data retrieval", "tensor", "noise measurement"], "abstract": "Tensor completion has attracted attention because of its promising ability and generality. However, there are few studies on noisy scenarios which directly solve an optimization problem consisting of a noise inequality constraint. In this paper, we propose a new tensor completion and denoising model including tensor total variation and tensor nuclear norm minimization with a range of values and noise inequalities. Furthermore, we developed its solution algorithm based on a primal-dual splitting method, which is computationally efficient as compared to tensor decomposition based non-convex optimization. Lastly, extensive experiments demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method for visual data retrieval such as for color images, movies, and 3D-volumetric data.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Nagoya Institute of Technology", "Nagoya Institute of Technology"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Tatsuya Yokota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yokota:Tatsuya", "Hidekata Hontani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hontani:Hidekata"], "pages": 9}
