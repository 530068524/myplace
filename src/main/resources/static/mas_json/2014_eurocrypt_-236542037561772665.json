{"title": "The Locality of Searchable Symmetric Encryption.", "fields": ["filesystem level encryption", "locality", "symmetric key algorithm", "quantum nonlocality", "computer science", "binary logarithm", "identifier", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "This paper proves a lower bound on the trade-off between server storage size and the locality of memory accesses in searchable symmetric encryption (SSE). Namely, when encrypting an index of N identifier/keyword pairs, the encrypted index must have size \u03c9(N) or the scheme must perform searching with \u03c9(1) non-contiguous reads to memory or the scheme must read many more bits than is necessary to compute the results. Recent implementations have shown that nonlocality of server memory accesses create a throughput-bottleneck on very large databases. Our lower bound shows that this is due to the security notion and not a defect of the constructions. An upper bound is also given in the form of a new SSE construction with an O(N logN) size encrypted index that performs O(log N) reads during a search.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "conf": "eurocrypt", "authors": ["David Cash.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cash:David", "Stefano Tessaro.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tessaro:Stefano"], "pages": 18}
