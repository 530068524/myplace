Most of the state-of-the-art methods are based on the assumption that reflectance changes come along with strong image edges. Recently, user intervention in the recovery problem has proved to be a remarkable source of improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that aims to overcome the shortcomings of pure edge-based methods by introducing strong surface descriptors, such as the color-name descriptor which introduces high-level considerations resembling top-down intervention. We also use a second surface descriptor, termed color-shade, which allows us to include physical considerations derived from the image formation model capturing gradual color surface variations. Both color cues are combined by means of a Markov Random Field. The method is quantitatively tested on the MIT ground truth dataset using different error metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "Autonomous University of Barcelona"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Marc Serra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Serra:Marc", "Olivier Penacchio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Penacchio:Olivier", "Robert Benavente.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Benavente:Robert", "Mar\u00eda Vanrell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vanrell_0001:Mar=iacute=a"], "pages": 8}
