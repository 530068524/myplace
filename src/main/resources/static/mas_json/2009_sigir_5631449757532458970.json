{"title": "The wisdom of the few: a collaborative filtering approach based on expert opinions from the web.", "fields": ["recommender system", "k nearest neighbors algorithm", "cosine similarity", "scalability", "collaborative filtering"], "abstract": "Nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering provides a successful means of generating recommendations for web users. However, this approach suffers from several shortcomings, including data sparsity and noise, the cold-start problem, and scalability. In this work, we present a novel method for recommending items to users based on expert opinions. Our method is a variation of traditional collaborative filtering: rather than applying a nearest neighbor algorithm to the user-rating data, predictions are computed using a set of expert neighbors from an independent dataset, whose opinions are weighted according to their similarity to the user. This method promises to address some of the weaknesses in traditional collaborative filtering, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We validate our approach by predicting a subset of the Netflix data set. We use ratings crawled from a web portal of expert reviews, measuring results both in terms of prediction accuracy and recommendation list precision. Finally, we explore the ability of our method to generate useful recommendations, by reporting the results of a user-study where users prefer the recommendations generated by our approach.", "citation": "Citations (158)", "departments": ["Telef\u00f3nica", "University College London", "Telef\u00f3nica", "KAIST", "Telef\u00f3nica"], "authors": ["Xavier Amatriain.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amatriain:Xavier", "Neal Lathia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lathia:Neal", "Josep M.
