This allows a very rich encoding of various types of pairwise interactions between nodes. We propose a new tractable approach to this problem based on maximum likelihood estimator and convex optimization. We analyze our algorithm under a general generative model, and provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for successful recovery of the underlying clusters. Our theoretical results cover and subsume a wide range of existing graph clustering results including planted partition, weighted clustering and partially observed graphs. Furthermore, the result is applicable to novel settings including time-varying graphs such that new insights can be gained on solving these problems. Our theoretical findings are further supported by empirical results on both synthetic and real data.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "University of California, Berkeley", "National University of Singapore"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Shiau Hong Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Shiau_Hong", "Yudong Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yudong", "Huan Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Huan"], "pages": 9}
