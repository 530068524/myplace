The conceptual framework highlights the central role played by counterfactual thinking and accountability. Findings from five focus groups are also presented to lend further support to the conceptual framework. Essentially, the article argues that a service failure event triggers an emotional response in the consumer, and from here the consumer commences an assessment of the situation, considering procedural justice, interactional justice, and distributive justice elements, while engaging in counterfactual thinking and apportioning accountability. More specifically, the customer assesses whether the service provider could and should have done something more to remedy the problem and how the customer would have felt had these actions been taken. The authors argue that during this process situational effort is taken into account when assessing accountability. When service providers do not appear to exhibit an appropriate level of effort, consumers attribute this to the service provider not caring. This in turn leads to the customer feeling more negative emotions, such as anger and frustration. Managerial implications of the study are discussed.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["The Turing Institute", "The Turing Institute", "University of Surrey", "The Turing Institute", "University College London", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "ETH Zurich", "University of Hartford", "Oklahoma State University\u2013Stillwater", "College of Business Administration", "University at Albany, SUNY", "City University of Hong Kong", "University of Alabama", "Louisiana Tech University", "Louisiana Tech University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Stanford University", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Dalian Medical University", "University of Colorado Boulder", "University of Hartford", "State University of New York System", "The College of  ... , United States"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Matt J.
