The challenges of organizing and evaluating a potentially large amount of data can be overcome through the use of annotations (title, tags, and audio notes). We created Zydeco, a multi-component system that students use to collect annotated multimedia data from a museum (using a smartphone app), and then create a scientific explanation with their personal and peers' data (using a tablet app). We ran a classroom study with 54 students (ages 11-13) investigating how students searched for, evaluated, and used annotated data to construct a scientific explanation. We found that tags supported data interpretation, while title searching and panning through the unfiltered data set supported finding and using data.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Alex Kuhn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuhn:Alex", "Brenna McNally.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/McNally:Brenna", "Shannon Schmoll.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmoll:Shannon", "Clara Cahill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cahill:Clara", "Wan-Tzu Lo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lo:Wan=Tzu", "Chris Quintana.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quintana:Chris", "Ibrahim Delen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Delen:Ibrahim"], "conf": "chi", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
