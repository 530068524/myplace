{"title": "LMSO: A Curry-Howard Approach to Church's Synthesis via Linear Logic.", "fields": ["mathematical proof", "game semantics", "realizability", "curry howard correspondence", "categorical logic"], "abstract": "We propose LMSO, a proof system inspired from Linear Logic, as a proof-theoretical framework to extract finite-state stream transducers from linear-constructive proofs of omega-regular specifications. We advocate LMSO as a stepping stone toward semi-automatic approaches to Church's synthesis combining computer assisted proofs with automatic decisions procedures. LMSO is correct in the sense that it comes with an automata-based realizability model in which proofs are interpreted as finite-state stream transducers. It is moreover complete, in the sense that every solvable instance of Church's synthesis problem leads to a linear-constructive proof of the formula specifying the synthesis problem.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Lyon"], "authors": ["Pierre Pradic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pradic:Pierre", "Colin Riba.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riba:Colin"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
