Our approach consists in iteratively improving an appearance-based model built with a Boosting procedure, and the reconstruction of trajectories corresponding to the motion of multiple targets. We demonstrate the efficiency of our procedure on pedestrian detection in videos and cell detection in microscopy image sequences. In both cases, our method is demonstrated to reduce the labeling requirement by one to two orders of magnitude. We show that in some instances, our method trained with sparse labels on a video sequence is able to outperform a standard learning procedure trained with the fully labeled sequence.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "Swiss Center fo ...
