{"title": "Efficient Learning by Directed Acyclic Graph For Resource Constrained Prediction.", "fields": ["decision rule", "empirical risk minimization", "dynamic programming", "training set", "directed acyclic graph"], "abstract": "We study the problem of reducing test-time acquisition costs in classification systems. Our goal is to learn decision rules that adaptively select sensors for each example as necessary to make a confident prediction. We model our system as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where internal nodes correspond to sensor subsets and decision functions at each node choose whether to acquire a new sensor or classify using the available measurements. This problem can be posed as an empirical risk minimization over training data. Rather than jointly optimizing such a highly coupled and non-convex problem over all decision nodes, we propose an efficient algorithm motivated by dynamic programming. We learn node policies in the DAG by reducing the global objective to a series of cost sensitive learning problems. Our approach is computationally efficient and has proven guarantees of convergence to the optimal system for a fixed architecture. In addition, we present an extension to map other budgeted learning problems with large number of sensors to our DAG architecture and demonstrate empirical performance exceeding state-of-the-art algorithms for data composed of both few and many sensors.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Boston University", "Boston University", "Systems & Techn ... ch, Woburn, MA"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Joseph Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Joseph", "Kirill Trapeznikov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Trapeznikov:Kirill", "Venkatesh Saligrama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saligrama:Venkatesh"], "pages": 9}
