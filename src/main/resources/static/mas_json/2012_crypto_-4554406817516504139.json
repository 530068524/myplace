{"title": "New Preimage Attacks against Reduced SHA-1.", "fields": ["padding", "image", "differential cryptanalysis", "preimage attack", "sha 1"], "abstract": "This paper shows preimage attacks against reduced SHA-1 up to 57 steps. The best previous attack has been presented at CRYPTO 2009 and was for 48 steps finding a two-block preimage with incorrect padding at the cost of 2159.3 evaluations of the compression function. For the same variant our attacks find a one-block preimage at 2150.6 and a correctly padded two-block preimage at 2151.1 evaluations of the compression function. The improved results come out of a differential view on the meet-in-the-middle technique originally developed by Aoki and Sasaki. The new framework closely relates meet-in-the-middle attacks to differential cryptanalysis which turns out to be particularly useful for hash functions with linear message expansion and weak diffusion properties.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Simon Knellwolf.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Knellwolf:Simon", "Dmitry Khovratovich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khovratovich:Dmitry"], "conf": "crypto", "year": "2012", "pages": 17}
