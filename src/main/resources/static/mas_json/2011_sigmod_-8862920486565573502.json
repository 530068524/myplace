Recent work has proposed a probabilistic database (PDB) based declarative IE system that supports a leading statistical IE model, and an associated inference algorithm to answer top-k-style queries over the probabilistic IE outcome. Still, the broader problem of effectively supporting general probabilistic inference inside a PDB-based declarative IE system remains open. In this paper, we explore the in-database implementations of a wide variety of inference algorithms suited to IE, including two Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, the Viterbi and the sum-product algorithms. We describe the rules for choosing appropriate inference algorithms based on the model, the query and the text, considering the trade-off between accuracy and runtime. Based on these rules, we describe a hybrid approach to optimize the execution of a single probabilistic IE query to employ different inference algorithms appropriate for different records. We show that our techniques can achieve up to 10-fold speedups compared to the non-hybrid solutions proposed in the literature.", "citation": "Citations (27)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "Technical University of Crete", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Daisy Zhe Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Daisy_Zhe", "Michael J.
