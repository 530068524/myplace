Our abstraction functions are catamorphisms (term algebra homomorphisms) mapping algebraic data type values into values in other decidable theories (e.g. sets, multisets, lists, integers, booleans). Each instance of our decision procedure family is sound; we identify a widely applicable many-to-one condition on abstraction functions that implies the completeness. Complete instances of our decision procedure include the following correctness statements: 1) a functional data structure implementation satisfies a recursively specified invariant, 2) such data structure conforms to a contract given in terms of sets, multisets, lists, sizes, or heights, 3) a transformation of a formula (or lambda term) abstract syntax tree changes the set of free variables in the specified way.", "citation": "Citations (94)", "departments": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "authors": ["Philippe Suter.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suter:Philippe", "Mirco Dotta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dotta:Mirco", "Viktor Kuncak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuncak:Viktor"], "conf": "popl", "year": "2010", "pages": 12}
