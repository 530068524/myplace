This places the model-checking problem for classes of bounded expansion in the parameterized circuit complexity class para-AC1. On the route to our result we prove that the basic decomposition toolbox for classes of bounded expansion, including orderings with bounded weak coloring numbers and low treedepth decompositions, can be computed in para-AC1.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw", "University of Warsaw"], "authors": ["Michal Pilipczuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pilipczuk:Michal", "Sebastian Siebertz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siebertz:Sebastian", "Szymon Torunczyk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Torunczyk:Szymon"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
