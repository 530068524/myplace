Our methodology addresses the issue that traditional p-values and confidence intervals give unreliable inference. This is because users of A/B testing software are known to  continuously monitor  these measures as the experiment is running. We provide  always valid  p-values and confidence intervals that are provably robust to this effect. Not only does this make it safe for a user to continuously monitor, but it empowers her to detect true effects more efficiently. This paper provides simulations and numerical studies on Optimizely's data, demonstrating an improvement in detection performance over traditional methods.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Optimizely, Inc ... ncisco, CA, USA", "Optimizely, Inc ... ncisco, CA, USA"], "authors": ["Ramesh Johari.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Johari:Ramesh", "Pete Koomen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koomen:Pete", "Leonid Pekelis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pekelis:Leonid", "David Walsh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Walsh_0002:David"], "conf": "kdd", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
